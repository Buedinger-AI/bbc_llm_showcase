9,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

20,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

13,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:39:20,Unknown,True
38,Who could replace Biden as Democratic nominee?,"US President Joe Biden's feeble debate performance last week sent shockwaves across the Democratic party, raising questions about who could replace him on the presidential ticket should he decide to step down.  The move - though unlikely - would create a logistical nightmare, and could set up an ugly inter-party fight among Democrats just months before voters cast their ballots.  But with Democrats expressing panic and confusion over the future of Mr Biden's candidacy, it has led to discussions about whether the president, 81, is the right candidate to face former President Donald Trump in November. Many Democrats noted the importance of defeating Trump when arguing for or against Mr Biden's claim to the party's nomination.  There are a handful of ways the president could be replaced on the ticket, but chances are slim that Mr Biden would vacate his candidacy with just over four months until the election.  But, if he does, here are some the people who might replace him. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is already on the ticket, is an obvious choice to replace Mr Biden.  As vice president, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights after the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v Wade.  Ms Harris has proved to be a loyal ally to the president and fiercely defended his debate performance. After the event, she admitted the president had a ""slow start"" but argued he went on to provide more substantive answers than Trump.  “People can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance,” Harris told CNN Thursday night.  Ms Harris has the strong name recognition that comes from the job of vice  president, but she has struggled with low approval ratings throughout her tenure.  Forty-nine percent of Americans disapprove of Ms Harris, while 39% approve, according to polling averages tracked by FiveThirtyEight.  Ms Harris will also have a prime-time moment that could vault her ahead of the pack of potential presidential contenders when she faces off against Trump's pick for vice president. The BBC's US media partner CBS is scheduled to host a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention in August.   Gretchen Whitmer, the two term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular mid-west Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  California Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the Biden Administration's fiercest surrogates. He frequently appears on cable news networks praising Mr Biden.  But Mr Newsom has political ambitions of his own.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits have said he would be an appealing stand-in for Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  It is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden Administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as Transportation Secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Mr Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The quick repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  The list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.   Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.  Maryland Governor Wes Moore has found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker are often mentioned, as they have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested senate race in a swing-state, has also been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.  A Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama. Though the former first lady has repeatedly said she does not have presidential aspirations.

47,How the BBC reports polling day,"The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election, 4 July. The BBC prepares detailed election guidelines which are written and published for each election, and they include guidance about polling day.  On polling day, the BBC does not report on any of the election campaigns from 06:00 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk, or on social media and other channels. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. The lists of candidates, as well as the manifesto guides, remain available online during polling day. Coverage of what is happening on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather.  It tends to focus on giving information that will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself until the polls have closed. That means no opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until the polls have closed. While the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish ""exit polls"" which includes surveys on how people have said they have voted in the election and may also offer a prediction on the election result based on what voters have said.   The BBC, however, is still able to report on events which are not directly related to the elections; and if there are stories about the mechanics of polling day, especially if they might contain important information to help voters, such as an incident at their local polling station, then that too can be reported, but, of course, with impartiality and editorial justification.  From 22:00 BST, after the close of the polls, the election guidelines no longer apply - but the BBC must still report on the election, of course, with the impartiality requirements set out by both Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines.

58,Labour set for general election landslide - exit poll,"Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent As they wait for more results, some Conservatives are turning their fury on Rishi Sunak’s inner circle. Shortly before polls closed, Sunak announced a string of honours for former cabinet ministers such as Theresa May and Chris Grayling. He also gave a peerage to Liam Booth-Smith, his chief of staff, and a knighthood to Oliver Dowden, his deputy prime minister. I’ve just had this through from a senior Conservative source: ""There is widespread disgust at the reward for abject failure in Rishi’s dissolution list. Sir Oliver Dowden pushed for an early election and has been the worst DPM in living memory, demonstrating terrible political judgment.  ""Lord Booth Smith is the architect of the Sunak project and connived to bring down the biggest election winning Tory PM in a generation. Sunak’s pledge to bring integrity back to politics when he entered Downing Street has proven to be a total lie. This an utter disgrace."" That gives you a flavour of the recriminations which are beginning right now. Sir Charles Walker, who stood down as a Conservative MP at the election, responded to that quote in our radio studio just now, saying: ""The idea that people in the Conservative Party are going to be as sanguine and magnanimous as I am, is for the birds.""",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn09xn9je7lt,Unknown,Unknown,,True

96,Victoria Starmer: Who is the new UK PM's wife?,"Throughout the general election campaign and much of her husband's tenure as Labour leader, Victoria Starmer has kept a low profile. Apart from appearances at Labour conferences, the odd state banquet and a Taylor Swift concert, Lady Starmer, nee Victoria Alexander, has sought to avoid public appearances  Asked on LBC about his wife's low profile, Sir Keir pointed out that she had a full-time job at an NHS hospital and that their eldest child was doing his GCSEs. “We took the decision that whilst I was out and about on the road, we wanted to create the environment where he could study calmly in ordinary circumstances.” However, now that Sir Keir has won the election and become prime minister, Lady Starmer may find it trickier to shun the spotlight.  When she first met Sir Keir in the early 2000s, he wasn't a politician but a barrister. She was a solicitor working on the same case.  Sir Keir told ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories, of their first meeting: ""I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate. ""I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said 'let's get her on the line.'"" He grilled her forensically on the paper but as he hung up he heard one comment from her. ""She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,"" Sir Keir said. ""And quite right too."" Despite the rocky beginnings, the relationship blossomed after a first date in the Lord Stanley pub in Camden, north London.  Speaking to his biographer Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir described her as ""grounded, sassy, funny, streetwise - and utterly gorgeous too"".  He proposed just a few months later on a holiday in Greece. ""Won't we need a ring, Keir?"" was her down-to-earth response.  They were married in 2007 at the Fennes estate in Essex, walking down the aisle to one of Sir Keir's favourite pieces of music - Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.5, 2nd movement. He later described her to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs as an ""incredibly warm, wonderful woman. My complete rock"". The couple have two teenage children - but have been at pains to keep them out of the limelight - making a point of not naming them in public.  Lady Starmer grew up in north London, not far from where she currently lives with her family.  She attended Channing School before studying law and sociology at Cardiff University. While there, she got involved in student politics, becoming president of the student union in 1994.  In an interview with the student newspaper Gair Rhydd, she said her main priority was to campaign against cuts to student grants.  Rob Watkins was at Cardiff University at the same time and worked as a photographer for the paper. He remembers the future Lady Starmer as being ""witty and professional, clearly dedicated to her work"" and aware of her responsibility to the people she represented.   Lady Starmer currently works in occupational health for the NHS - something her husband has frequently referred to during his time as Labour leader.  He says it gives him insight into the problems faced by the health service.  Speaking to the Times in May, Sir Keir said his wife intended to keep her job if he won the election.  “She’s absolutely going to carry on working, she wants to and she loves it."" While the couple say they want to keep life as normal as possible for their children, their domestic life has already been disrupted by Sir Keir's job. In April, pro-Palestinian demonstrators held a protest outside their home, hanging a banner outside their house and laying children's shoes outside the front door.  Lady Starmer had returned from a shopping trip with her son when she saw the protesters.  Asked how the protest made her feel, Lady Starmer said: ""I felt a bit sick, to be perfectly honest.""",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe2veedg40o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-05 11:10:29,,True

Voting begins in mainland France at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and the first exit polls will be released 12 hours later. Whatever the result, it is difficult to see President Emmanuel Macron coming out of this well. Four weeks ago, he said it was the responsible solution to call a snap vote in response to the RN’s victory in European elections, minutes after the party’s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella challenged him to do so. The two-round election came as a shock to a country gearing up for the start of the Paris Olympics on 26 July. Security was already tight and now 30,000 police have been deployed for a period of heightened political tension. There are fears of violence in Paris and other French cities, whatever the outcome of the vote, and a planned protest outside the National Assembly on Sunday evening has been banned. In Dreux, a historic old town on the road to Normandy, Sunday’s vote falls on the day the Olympic flame is passing through. “For us it’s a massive thing, bigger than the election,” says Pauline in the tourist office. The flame has been travelling around France for almost two months, and Dreux has planned a weekend of festivities to mark its arrival. “Macron should have waited until after the Olympics,” Dreux resident Antoine told the BBC. Veteran commentator Nicolas Baverez believes the president has not just blown up his term in office and opened the gates of power wide for the far right. “He’s compromised the running of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which could deliver a final blow to France’s credit and its image,” he wrote in Le Point on the eve of the vote. The constituency that includes Dreux is one of the races to watch in the second round of this election.  Candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already won their seats, by winning more than half the vote. But another 500 contests are being decided in run-offs, mostly involving either two or three candidates. Former conservative cabinet minister Olivier Marleix was beaten in the first round by far-right candidate Olivier Dubois. They both qualified for the run-off, along with a candidate from the left-wing New Popular Front, which is in second place nationally. But because Nadia Faveris was narrowly beaten into third by her conservative rival, she pulled out of the race “to block National Rally”. One voter, Morgan, was sceptical that anything would change in the town, whoever won. There have been 217 of these withdrawals across France, including 130 Popular Front candidates and 81 from the president’s Ensemble alliance. And that has dramatically changed the balance of this pivotal general election. Projections after Sunday’s first round gave the RN a fighting chance of securing an outright majority of 289 seats, but final opinion polls on Friday suggest that is now out of reach, with 205 to 210 seats as a potential maximum. The parties trying to block an RN victory range from the radical left, Communists and Greens to the Macron centrists and conservatives. They say they are defending the Fifth Republic from the extreme policies of the far right. National Rally has watered down many of its policies but still wants to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing. It aims to abolish the right of automatic citizenship to the children of immigrants who have spent five years aged 11 to 18 in France. It also wants to bar dual nationals from dozens of sensitive jobs. Opinion polls are not necessarily reliable. Each of the 500 races is a local contest and voters do not follow recommendations from political parties. If the RN managed upwards of 250 seats, it might seek out allies to form a minority government. President Macron's party had to make do with similar numbers until he became frustrated with his limited ability to pass reforms in parliament. That kind of RN government is unlikely, believes Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris. It would soon face a vote of no confidence, he believes, and under the constitution, France cannot have another general election for at least another year. Another potential scenario is a “grand coalition” that would involve most of the other parties, except for the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party, which the Macron alliance and conservatives reject as extremists. This idea has gained some momentum in recent days, but Greens leader Marine Tondelier has made clear “there’ll be no Macronist prime minister”, whatever happens. There is also talk of a technocrat government, similar to those that ran Italy during the eurozone debt crisis. But instead of choosing experts from outside politics, it might include politicians with proven expertise in particular fields. In any case, France is entering uncharted territory, says Jean-Yves Dormagen of the Cluster 17 institute. President Macron himself has said he is not about to resign and will continue to serve out his final three years in office. “We will have Macron as a lame duck president who created this mess without having to do so,” Prof Steinbach told the BBC. “And he’s losing legitimacy.” The immediate concern for France is to have some kind of government in place during the Olympic Games. Constitutional expert Benjamin Morel believes the president could form a national unity government until the end of the Paris Games. “That would give the parties time to to reach an agreement between now and the start of the school year and the next budget,” he told Le Figaro.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0ygnyxgnqo,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,,True
121,Murray's Wimbledon career over as Raducanu pulls out of doubles,"Andy Murray is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event Andy Murray's Wimbledon career is over after Emma Raducanu pulled out of their planned appearance in the mixed doubles. Former world number one Murray, 37, was due to play alongside his fellow Briton on Saturday evening at the All England Club. Raducanu, 21, said she has ""some stiffness"" in her right wrist. She moved into the fourth round of the women's singles with a dominant two-set win over Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari on Friday. ""I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles,"" she said. ""I’m disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but I've got to take care."" This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, was playing at SW19 for the last time before retiring later this year. The Scot is said to be ""disappointed"" that he is unable to play alongside 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, who missed Wimbledon last year after having surgery on both wrists. Murray's mother Judy, in response to a post on X from television presenter Marcus Buckland describing Raducanu's decision as ""astonishing"", wrote: ""Yes, astonishing."" Murray was not permitted to find a replacement partner for Raducanu under tournament rules because the draw had already been made. Murray and Raducanu, who were set to play China's Zhang Shuai and El Salvador's Marcelo Arevalo, have been replaced by an alternate pairing. It means Murray made his final appearance on Thursday when he lost alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation. Murray pulled out of the singles on Tuesday as he continues to recover from a back operation on 22 June. The three-time major champion is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event. 'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray 'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Wimbledon Saturday’s schedule played a major part in Emma Raducanu's decision. Being asked to play in the fourth match of the day on Court One is the same as being asked to play in a night session. And given this Grand Slam is a predominantly daytime event, you can understand why a player would not want to spend all evening on site with a fourth-round singles match the following day. The schedule put Raducanu in a very awkward position, and has led to a decision which will be very disappointing for Murray and everyone looking forward to what would have been a fun finale to his Wimbledon career. This was no ordinary mixed doubles pairing, although players do regularly prioritise singles over doubles. And there can be no change of partner once the draw is made. So instead of Murray teaming up with another British player, American alternates Rajeev Ram and Katie Volynets come into the draw.

115,'I'm worried' - Democrats at Biden rally open to change,"The hundreds of die-hard Democrats who turned out to see Joe Biden in Wisconsin on Friday didn’t need much convincing. The US president received an enthusiastic response to his loudly delivered remarks at the rally in Madison, especially when he attacked his Republican rival Donald Trump. But as some major Democratic donors and lawmakers call on Mr Biden to exit the presidential race, even some of his most ardent supporters here in Madison are keeping an open mind about whether he might be replaced - and what might come next. “It’s OK to change our minds,” said Catherine Emmanuelle, 44, who paused and considered her thoughts carefully before outlining her opinion.  She stressed that she was impressed with Mr Biden’s 17-minute speech, which she called a “presidential litmus test”. “But if something happens in three days or a week or three weeks, we shouldn’t be afraid of having a conversation about change,” she told BBC News. Mr Biden is under tremendous scrutiny after a disastrous debate performance last week, marked by a hoarse voice and several instances where he lost his train of thought. The president, 81, is facing a tide of doubts about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump, 78, in November's election.  Friday’s rally, held in this reliably Democratic town in a critical swing state, was an indication of the support Mr Biden still has in many parts of the country. But the raucous crowd, which waited through several opening speakers and a hour-long delay from the planned start time, was also shot through with low-grade anxiety. “I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump,” said Thomas Leffler, a 33-year-old health researcher.  ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said - a reference to the Democratic Party's signature colour.  Mr Leffler suggested that picking a new candidate might have unexpected benefits. “If you go through some sort of open process, you can re-energise people, and show that there’s a process better than what Republicans have, which is basically just to bow down to Donald Trump,” he said. Earlier this year, both the president and Trump secured the delegates needed to be their party's respective presumptive candidates. The Democrats' nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from 19-22 August. On Friday, Mr Biden was defiant about staying in the race, telling the crowd: ""I am running and going to win again.” Some of the biggest cheers on Friday came when the president directly went after his predecessor. “Trump is not just a convicted criminal,” he said. “He’s a one man crime wave.” The prospect of a second Trump administration was an animating factor for many who came to the rally. “During the debate, he told a bunch of lies,” said Greg Hovel, 67. “How is that any worse than what Biden did?” Mr Hovel said he believed the country was in a “great place” and that Mr Biden didn’t get enough credit for his economic and pandemic recovery policies. “At this point, in the next six weeks, the Democratic Party is going to have to make up its mind” whether to retain Mr Biden as their candidate or pick someone new, he said. But the president’s performance on Friday further bolstered something he strongly believed, even before the speech. “I think Biden can win,” he said.

141,Democrats weigh risks and rewards of losing Biden,"President Joe Biden sought to revive his beleaguered re-election effort on Sunday, as members of his party debated the future of his candidacy. The president's halting debate performance last week raised serious questions about his physical and mental capacity to run. A prime time interview with ABC on Friday fuelled further speculation about his campaign's future.  Amid the uncertainty, Mr Biden appeared at two campaign events in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, on Sunday. But those efforts have not stopped the president's fellow Democrats from weighing the risks and rewards of keeping Mr Biden, 81, at the top of the ticket. On Sunday afternoon, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries convened a meeting with ranking Democratic lawmakers that reportedly included discussion of Mr Biden's candidacy. Four of those on the call said they thought Biden should drop out, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. Sources said at least three others expressed concern about his chances in November. A number of top Democratic figures also voiced their stances in televised interviews over the weekend, aiming to address the question: is it riskier to stick with Mr Biden or to leave him behind? Some say the party could be headed to defeat against Donald Trump in November if Mr Biden stays on, but others say replacing him comes with many unknowns.  Amid the fallout of Mr Biden's disastrous debate performance, asking the president to step aside could bring some immediate relief. Some Democrats, including avowed supporters of the president, have said as much, suggesting that concerns about his age and mental acuity had grown difficult to overcome.  The debate ""rightfully raised questions among the American people about whether the president has the vigour to defeat Donald Trump"", said California Representative Adam Schiff on Sunday.  Mr Schiff stopped short of saying Biden should drop out in his interview with NBC News - a position taken publicly by five House Democrats so far.  Instead, Mr Schiff urged him to seek advice from people with “distance and objectivity” and make a decision about whether he believes he is the best candidate to run. ""Given Joe Biden's incredible record, given Donald Trump's terrible record, he [Biden] should be mopping the floor with Donald Trump,"" Mr Schiff said. ""It should not be even close and there's only one reason it is close, and that's the president's age.""  Mr Biden is 81, while Trump has just turned 78. The ages of both candidates have become an increasingly contentious point among voters. On the left, polls suggest some voters are losing faith in Mr Biden. In a Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, 86% of Democrats said they would support Mr Biden, down from 93% in February. A different candidate may also offer a clean slate in other areas, too. Before this wave of Democratic panic, Mr Biden drew criticism from voters on several policy fronts, including his handling of the US economy and the migrant crisis at the country's southern border.    The president faced a threat of defection from progressive voters who oppose his response to Israel's war in Gaza. Their resistance cost him more than 100,000 votes in Michigan - a crucial swing state - during its primary in February.  A Biden ticket ""is going to drag everybody else down"", said former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan on Sunday in an interview with Fox News. ""I think you're going to see a significant amount of pressure whether it's today or tomorrow, sometime this week, as members come back that this may be untenable for them.""  Any benefit to losing Mr Biden may be muted by the looming risks, according to some Democratic leaders.  If the president stood aside, most of what comes after remains unclear: who would replace Mr Biden, and how? And how would that candidate fare against Trump?  And in recent days, several Biden allies have stressed the pitfalls of charting a new course, arguing that Mr Biden has been a proven success.   ""Biden is old,"" said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, on CBS News on Sunday. ""He is not as articulate as he once was. I wish he could jump up the steps on Air Force One. He can't. What we have got to focus on is policy - whose policies have and will benefit the vast majority of the people in this country.""  California Governor Gavin Newsom, who spent the weekend stumping for the president, said the same at a rally in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on Saturday.  “It’s the hypothetical that gets in the way of progress in terms of promoting this candidacy,” Mr Newsom said. “It’s exactly where the other party wants us to be, is having this internal fight, and I think it’s extraordinarily unhelpful.” Mr Biden's public supporters say replacing him may become a direct benefit to Trump's Republicans, who can argue their opponents are engulfed in party chaos.  ""We've got to stop talking about this,"" Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said on CNN on Sunday. ""We've spent a whole week. Republicans are having a great time. I mean, we need to get back to talking about Donald Trump and his performance.""  Earlier this week, former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan put forward a potential replacement: Mr Biden's Vice-president Kamala Harris.  ""I strongly believe that our best path forward is Kamala Harris,"" he wrote in a op-ed for Newsweek. ""Those who say that a Harris candidacy is a greater risk than the Joe Biden we saw the other night and will continue to see are not living in reality."" Though she has demonstrated only loyal support to Mr Biden, the idea of Ms Harris, 59, stepping in for Mr Biden has gained traction in recent days.  In Adam Schiff's Sunday morning interview, the congressman said Ms Harris could win against Trump ""overwhelmingly"".  As vice-president, and a 2020 Democratic contender, supporters say she is already campaign-tested and familiar to the Democratic establishment and its fundraisers.  Ms Harris ""knows the job"", said former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile on ABC on Sunday. ""To ask the delegates elected to the convention who are Biden-Harris supporters to bypass Kamala Harris... it would be political malpractice.""  But what makes her attractive to supporters could also be a catch: age isn't voters' only complaint against Biden and the administration's baggage surrounding policy choices could extend to Ms Harris.

145,"After Covid and Olympics, Tokyo’s first female governor set for third term","Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike is certain to win a third consecutive term in Sunday's gubernatorial election, according to exit polls. The 71-year-old first female governor of Japan's most populous city, will secure her position for another four years. Her victory will be a relief for struggling Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who backed the 71-year-old to win a third term. She was elected  in 2016, and won her second term in 2020. The conservative governor successfully guided the city through the coronavirus pandemic and its delayed summer Olympics in 2021. Japan’s tumbling fertility became a major issue during this campaign, and the victorious candidate will now have to work hard to improve Tokyo’s shockingly low birth rate. At 0.99 - less than one child per woman aged between 15 and 49 - it is the lowest of any region nationwide. Her appointment makes her one of the most powerful women in Japan's male dominated politics – with Tokyo accounting for about 11% of the population and contributing to nearly 20% of the country’s total GDP. It also puts her in charge of the city’s budget – which climbed to a staggering 16.55 trillion yen ($100bn; £80bn) this fiscal year. Ms Koike, 71, got more than 40% of the vote according to Reuters.   Declaring victory, Ms Koike said her main challenge was ""how to proceed with digital transformation as industries have changed significantly."" She said she would consolidate efforts to keep improving Tokyo, including ""the environment for women's empowerment"", which she said was ""insufficient [in Japan] compared to other parts of the world.""  Unexpectedly, Shinji Ishimaru, 41, an independent candidate and the former mayor of Akitakata, a town in Hiroshima prefecture, placed second, a position that was long thought to be guaranteed for Renho Saito.  Ms Renho, 56, supported by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), came in third. Mr Ishimaru, was relatively unknown in Tokyo before the official campaign began. During the election campaign, he focused on boosting his profile by reaching out to his large social media following. Mr Ishimaru's success is thought to be down to his appeal among young voters. As a former banker, he also focused on advancing the economy and industry of Tokyo.  After the polls closed, he told his supporters, ""I did all I could"", alluding to the fact that he had no particular party affiliation, unlike the two main contenders.   Yuriko Koike started her career as a journalist, working as a television news anchor before moving into politics in the early 1990s. But it was not until 2016 that she came to true national prominence after winning the governorship of Tokyo for the first time. She was not the official candidate of LDP, but still managed to win comfortably, taking more than 2.9 million votes to become the first woman in the role. ""I will lead Tokyo politics in an unprecedented manner, a Tokyo you have never seen,"" Ms Koike promised supporters on election night. She officially left the LDP in 2017 to set up her own political party, though she retains the support of many in the party – who gave her their backing in the 2024 race. Ms Koike vowed to focus on local issues during her term, including tackling overcrowding on public transport, as well as the culture of overworking in the city. But it was global issues that came to dominate her time in office. The emergence of Covid-19 forced Tokyo to delay its summer Olympics, planned for 2020. Ms Koike won a second term that year after her successful handling of the pandemic, and garnered further praise for managing the delayed Olympics, held in the city in 2021 in the shadow of the coronavirus. Ms Koike, however has not escaped scandal. An allegation that she never graduated from Cairo University – first reported during her first term – has never quite died away. Despite repeated denials from her and a statement confirming her graduation from the university itself, reports that she falsified her graduation documents still persisted during her try at a third gubernatorial term. Opponents also criticised her for failing to follow through on her pledges in Tokyo. The trains remain overcrowded and overwork culture remains a problem, they say. Of the 56 candidates the voters had to choose from, it had been expected Renho Saito would be Ms Koike's main opponent.  The former upper house member was backed by the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, as well as the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. Ms Renho left the CDP before official campaigning started on June 20. She lost her Upper House seat when she filed her candidacy. She rose to lead the centre-left group in 2016 as its first ever female head, but resigned a year later over poor results in Tokyo’s prefectural election. Japanese media projected the race as a proxy war between national parties, as the conservative incumbent was challenged by the left-leaning opposition politician.  The gubernatorial election also took place amid a climate of general mistrust towards politics. Critics say this is linked in part to the economic difficulties of the Japanese followed by an end of the long historical period of deflation, and the weakening of the yen.",2024-07-07 23:10:25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5gjjw20zo,"Toby Luckhurst,",2024-07-07 14:10:25,,True
164,Olise joins Bayern from Palace on five-year deal,"Michael Olise played half of Crystal Palace's Premier League matches last season as he was hampered with a hamstring injury Bayern Munich have signed winger Michael Olise from Crystal Palace for about 60m euros (£50m). The 22-year-old English-born France Under-21 forward made 90 appearances in all competitions over three seasons with Palace. Olise, who joined the Eagles from Reading for £8m in July 2021, has signed a five-year deal. Chelsea and Newcastle United registered their interest in Olise earlier this summer but the winger has chosen to move to Germany, where he will work under Bayern's new manager Vincent Kompany. ""I'm very happy to now be playing for such a big club - it's a great challenge and that's exactly what I was looking for,"" said Olise. ""I want to prove myself at this level and play my part in ensuring we win as many titles as possible in the coming years."" Olise scored 10 goals in 19 Premier League appearances as Palace finished 10th in the table last season. He has been selected in the France squad for the Olympics that start in Paris later this month. ""We are hugely proud of what Michael has achieved at Crystal Palace, a club where he has developed greatly as a player,"" said Eagles chairman Steve Parish. ""We respect his desire to further test himself at the highest level of world football."" Bayern are also set to complete the signing of Fulham's Joao Palhinha in a deal worth £42m plus £4m in add-ons. The 28-year-old Portugal midfielder was close to joining Bayern last summer but a deal collapsed on deadline day.

178,After France's election shock comes the real power struggle,"The drama and vitriol of France’s sudden summer election is over. Now comes the drama and vitriol of stage two - and what could be a much longer and equally agitated struggle to build a functional coalition out of the inconclusive results of Saturday’s vote. “A lot of things are unclear. We know who lost but we don’t know who won. Can we learn the art of compromise which is so unusual for us? Nobody knows - the signs are not necessarily good,” Sylvie Kauffmann, a newspaper columnist for Le Monde, told me. The risks of deadlock – for France itself, for its constitutional order, for European stability, and even for Ukraine’s war against Russian aggression – are serious. But it’s worth remembering that this country is no stranger to coping with political upheavals. Revolutions aside, there was the chaos and revolts that followed World War Two and eventually upended France’s constitutional order, leading to the current system of government, known as the Fifth Republic. And more recently there were the challenges of “cohabitation”, when presidents and prime ministers from rival parties were obliged to share power. As politicians now sidle away for their summer holidays, or refocus their attention on the imminent Paris Olympics, it seems more than likely that the political temperature in France will subside by a degree or two, at least briefly. But the cohabitation battles of the 1980s and 1990s look like gentlemanly squabbles over a wine menu compared with the furious, guillotines-at-dawn brawls that many observers expect to preoccupy France’s National Assembly for weeks, or even months, to come. Some wonder if the French electorate – by saddling parliament with three minority blocks of almost equal size – has rendered the country “ungovernable,” or whether it is simply faced with the sort of deal-making challenge that so many other European nations wrestle with almost as a matter of course. Having emerged, to almost universal surprise, with the most seats at this parliamentary election, France’s left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NPF) has now earned the right to pick – or try to pick - the next prime minister and to implement its agenda. But with no working majority, any viable candidate will need to win support from other, more centrist parties. Who could possibly fit that bill? The NPF was quick to unite around a common platform ahead of the elections. But it contains deep political rifts – stretching as it does from anti-capitalists and communists to mainstream social democrats. The coalition is also home to some divisive figures, like the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who could quickly trigger the coalition’s collapse over the factionalism that has often marked the left of French politics. Some wonder if the Green Party leader, Marine Tondelier, might be a good fit. Her relatively low profile could be an asset in a political landscape scarred by years of deeply personal, and sometimes vitriolic, feuding. In the midst of this, President Emmanuel Macron remains on his throne, scarred by self-inflicted political wounds, but arguably a little stronger than he was a few days ago. His centrist grouping lost almost a third of its seats in the National Assembly as a result of his entirely unnecessary electoral gamble to dissolve parliament and call elections. But a disciplined frenzy of deal-making with the NPF helped it cling onto many more seats in the second round than the pollsters predicted. Could deadlock in parliament enable Mr Macron to float above the chaos and strengthen his position? Even his allies seem sceptical, convinced he is now trapped in a “stranglehold” between the extremes he once promised to banish from French political life. “Today, the President of the Republic will maintain a small margin of manoeuvre to act. But he will no longer be the political programmatic driving force in the country. From this point of view, after seven years, Macronism is dead,” Gilles Legendre, a disillusioned former MP who used to lead Macron’s party in the Assembly, told the BBC. As for the far-right National Rally (RN), it will no doubt recover quickly from the shock of Sunday night’s results, which prompted sombre silence at the party’s headquarters - a jarring contrast with the euphoric street celebrations by left-wing voters which swept through parts of Paris that same evening. The RN has already sought to reframe its third-place disappointment as the result of cynical deal-making by a “dishonest alliance” of its rivals, rather than evidence of its own shallow pool of credible candidates and its failure to convince enough French voters of the sincerity of its move away from the extreme right. The RN will surely try to promote its own agenda – including a clampdown on immigration and reforms of schools and policing. Its commitment to supporting Ukraine remains unclear, given the party’s recent support for the Kremlin and its occupation of Crimea. The RN must now be hoping that the Assembly is either deadlocked or dominated by an economically profligate far-left agenda that could further threaten France’s already strained budget. Months, or even years, of turmoil could then give the party a chance to portray itself as a stable and modernising force, thwarted by left-wing extremists and old elites. That in turn could, potentially, give the RN a good chance of increasing its vote share in any subsequent snap parliamentary election, or – and this is the real prize – sweeping its leader Marine Le Pen into the Presidency in 2027.

173,'I had to downgrade my life' - US workers in debt to buy groceries,"Stacey Ellis, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania, should be the kind of voter that US President Joe Biden can count on. But after four years of rising prices, her support has worn thin – and every time she shops at the supermarket, she is reminded how things have changed for the worse. Ms Ellis works full-time as a nurse’s assistant and has a second part-time job. But she needs to economise. She has switched stores, cut out brand-name items like Dove soap and Stroehmann bread, and all but said goodbye to her favourite Chick-fil-A sandwich. Still, Ms Ellis has sometimes turned to risky payday loans (short-term borrowing with high interest rates) as she grapples with grocery prices that have surged 25% since Mr Biden entered office in January 2021. ""Prior to inflation,"" she says, ""I didn't have any debt, I didn't have any credit cards, never applied for like a payday loan or any of those things. But since inflation, I needed to do all those things....I’ve had to downgrade my life completely."" The leap in grocery prices has outpaced the historic 20% rise in living costs that followed the pandemic, squeezing households around the country and fuelling widespread economic and political discontent. ""I’m a Democrat,"" says Ms Ellis, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown. ""I love voting for them. But Republicans are speaking volumes right now and Democrats are whispering."" “I want somebody to help me, help the American people,"" she adds. “Joe Biden, where are you?” For the president, already contending with serious doubts about his age and fitness for another term, the cost-of-living issue presents a major challenge, threatening to dampen turnout among supporters in an election that could be decided, like the last two, by several tens of thousands of votes in a handful key states.  Across the country, Americans on average spent more than 11% of their incomes on food, including restaurant meals last year – a higher proportion than any time since 1991. The jump in food prices has hit younger, lower-income and minority households -  key parts of the coalition that helped Mr Biden win the White House in 2020 - especially hard. But worries about the issue are widespread: a Pew survey earlier this year found that 94% of Americans were at least somewhat concerned about rising food and consumer goods prices. That was nearly identical to two years earlier, even though the staggering jumps in food prices that hit the US and other countries after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine have subsided. Dylan Garcia, a 26-year-old security guard from Brooklyn, says he’s never struggled to buy groceries as much as he has now. Instead of the fresh food and brand-name items he used to enjoy, he now stocks up on ramen noodles and frozen vegetables - and only eats twice a day because he can't afford more. At checkout, he routinely uses ""buy now, pay later” schemes, which allow him to pay the bill in installments, but have led to mounting debt. “I’m stuck in a loop,” he says. “It’s become an insecurity to pull up my phone at the register and have to use these programmes. When they see me, it’s embarrassing.” Mr Garcia, who has long voted for Democrats, says his precarious financial situation has made him lose hope in politics and he does not plan to vote in November's election. “I don’t think the government has our best interest and I don’t think they care,” he says. The White House maintains Mr Biden has been engaged on issues of food affordability, fighting to increase food stamp benefits and other government aid, initiatives opposed by Republicans.  At last month's presidential debate, the first question was on inflation, and Mr Biden sought to shift blame to big companies, accusing them of price gouging – a claim that is hotly disputed among economists. But despite strong job creation and low unemployment, opinion polls show voters continue to trust Mr Biden's opponent, former President Donald Trump, more on economic issues. On the CNN debate stage, the Republican White House candidate blamed Mr Biden for stoking inflation, which the White House denies, and said: “It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can’t.” The Trump campaign in turn denies that policies he proposes - including a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the US - would worsen price rises, as many analysts predict.  ""We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the US's economic standing in the world, and a destabilizing effect on the US's domestic economy,"" wrote 16 Nobel prize-winning economists in an open letter last month. Republicans have accused Mr Biden of trying to mislead the public about the extent of the inflation problem, noting that Mr Biden has claimed, incorrectly, that inflation was already at 9% when he entered office. It was 1.4%. Katie Walsh, a makeup artist in Pennsylvania, voted for Trump in 2020 and says she plans to do so again, based on his economic record. The 39-year-old says her family has struggled to keep up with inflation, especially since her business has slowed, as people squeezed by higher prices cut back. ""I know he's a big fat mouth,"" she says of Mr Trump. ""But he at least knows how to run the economy."" Analysts say it is clear that the economy is important to voters, but less clear it will prove decisive in the November election. In 2022, when inflation was at its worst, Democrats did better than expected in mid-term elections, as concerns about abortion access drove supporters to the polls.  This time around, issues such as immigration and fitness for office are also top of many voters' minds, while economic trends appear to be moving in the right direction. Grocery prices were up just 1% over the past 12 months, well within historic norms; and the cost of a few items, including rice, fish, apples, potatoes, and milk, has even come down a bit. As major chains such as Target, Amazon and Walmart announce price cuts in recent weeks, there are signs the situation could continue to improve. Some analysts also expect wages, which have increased but trailed the leap in overall prices, to finally catch up this year, providing further relief. “We’re on the right track,” says Sarah Foster, who follows the economy for  Bankrate.com. “Wage growth has slowed, price growth has slowed but, you know, prices are slowing at a much faster rate than wages.” Stephen Lemelin, a 49-year-old father of two from Michigan, another electoral battleground, says he was pleasantly surprised by lower prices on a recent supermarket trip. Whatever his concerns about the economy, the military veteran says his support for Mr Biden, who got his vote in 2020, has never been in doubt, given that he sees Trump as a threat to democracy. “Nobody likes high interest rates or high inflation but that’s not under presidential control,” he says. “If you know politics, there’s really only one choice.”",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx002795738o,"Natalie Sherman and Nathalie Jimenez,",2024-07-07 23:09:47,,True
209,This Nato summit could save or sink Biden's candidacy,"It is a week of reckoning for Joe Biden.  Twelve days after a halting debate performance that may go down as one of the most damaging in modern American history, the president is fighting for his political survival under intense domestic and global scrutiny. This week’s Nato summit in Washington DC may be his path to at least a temporary reprieve - or this president’s last stand. In the past few days, Mr Biden has railed against his critics, claimed the mandate of Democratic primary voters and challenged opponents to step forward and try to unseat him.  He has promised repeatedly that he is moving ahead with his campaign and that the time for second-guessing and hand-wringing is over. That pressing ahead will start at the Nato summit.  Mr Biden will host alliance leaders for three days of meetings and public events culminating in a solo press conference on Thursday afternoon.  It is a stage on which Mr Biden, a man well versed in foreign relations, should be comfortable. But it also raises the already high stakes for his presidency, given that a poor showing will have international as well as domestic ramifications. A mistake could start a political stampede among Democrats that extinguishes his hopes of even making it to the November general election, let alone winning it.  It could also sharpen concerns from European allies who are concerned about the increasing likelihood of a Donald Trump presidency and the dramatic foreign policy shifts that would come with it. “Biden is entering this week diminished,” said Kristine Berzina, managing director of the German Marshall Fund Geostrategy North.  “We don’t know how he’s going to exit it.” It is understood that many European leaders are anxious about Trump and his foreign policy strategy. The former president has disparaged multilateral international alliances. Ms Berzina said that in the past two weeks, however, these leaders have been experiencing something new - Biden anxiety. After his halting debate performance, she says, American allies have begun doubting whether the president is up to the task.  Heading into the Nato summit, they are hoping to see some evidence that his performance that night was an aberration and not reflective of a new normal.  “It is worrisome to have a close ally, your most meaningful ally, falter,” said Ms Berzina.  “So I think there is tremendous hope that Biden passes the test. But if he isn’t able to deliver, it creates more questions about the US’s reliability.” Eyes will be on the US president as he attends summit sessions, hosts foreign leaders at the White House and engages in bilateral meetings with key leaders, including newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Even behind closed doors of the Nato meetings, word of Mr Biden’s performance - good or bad - is sure to leak out. Mr Biden faces an even taller task this week domestically. The president has pointed to buttressing and expanding Nato in the face of Russian aggression as one of his key accomplishments.  This is something that differentiates his leadership from Trump’s - as well as any Democrats who could potentially replace him on the ballot - and the summit will be his chance to put that on display for the American public. “Who’s going to be able to keep Nato together like me?” the president said in his interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on Friday. He added that the Nato summit would be a good way to judge his abilities. “Come listen,” he said. “See what they say.” But simply clearing low expectations at the Nato summit and the Thursday press conference may not be enough for many of the politicians, pundits and party activists who are already calling for him to step aside. “Just having some good appearances is not going to stop the questions,” said Bill Scher, a liberal pundit and editor of Washington Monthly who recently penned a column calling for Mr Biden to step aside for Vice-President Kamala Harris.  “Time was really of the essence to nip all the speculation in the bud, and they wasted a week. There is no clear path out of this situation.” Mr Scher - a longtime supporter of Mr Biden - says the president’s attempts to push back now with media interviews, letters and calls to Democratic politicians come after public sentiment has solidified against him.  And once that sentiment is fully cemented in the polls - which could take several weeks - it will probably be too late to cleanly replace him. “I understand how difficult it has to be when you’re nearing the end of your life and you’re not performing as well as you used to,” Mr Scher said. “Having to come to terms with that in public has to be excruciating.” But the data that shows Mr Biden losing support and facing defeat in November is becoming increasingly clear.  Polls indicate nearly three-quarters of Americans - and even a majority of Democrats - think the president should stand down. A half-dozen Democratic members of Congress have called for him to abandon his bid, and many others have offered only equivocal support. The president continues to say he will press ahead with his campaign, however, and he has the national convention delegates to ensure that he is the Democratic nominee. The decision lies firmly in his hands, and if he can make it through the week without a major misstep, he may, in fact, survive the immediate storm. The story of this week, however, has been set. It isn’t one of Nato celebrating its 75th year of existence and focusing on the challenges to come.  Instead, it is a narrative that could decide whether Mr Biden can politically live to fight another day.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0471nye4lko,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-09 07:11:35,,True
215,Indian wrestlers eye Olympics after sex harassment scandal,"Over a year after protests against sexual harassment allegations shook Indian wrestling, female athletes are gearing up for major events, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. The BBC spoke to young wrestlers about their journey. Reetika Hooda almost didn't make it. The 23-year-old is among the five Indian women wrestlers to qualify for the Olympics this year. It’s a hard-won opportunity, following a year of setbacks that shook her confidence. She knew she needed more training and competitions to improve her game. A year ago, all wrestling came to a halt in India after its federation chief Brij Bhushan Singh was accused of sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations. India’s sports ministry did not sack Singh but it disbanded the federation after finding several lapses, including the non-compliance of sexual harassment laws, and set up a temporary team to run things. It was an unprecedented time. Hooda remembers watching the country’s most accomplished wrestlers, including her inspiration Sakshi Malik - the only Indian woman to win an Olympic medal in wrestling - camp on the roads of Delhi, demanding Singh’s resignation. The protest made headlines globally, especially after the police detained the wrestlers when they tried to march to India's new parliament building. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) condemned the way the wrestlers were treated and called for an impartial inquiry into their complaints. “It was sad - not only because of what was happening but also what wasn’t,” Hooda told me. Each year, the International Olympic Committee designates certain tournaments as qualification events for the games. To compete, wrestlers must earn ranking points in trials, win national competitions, and secure the Wrestling Federation of India's (WFI) approval. But instead of competing, Hooda stared at an empty sporting calendar for weeks. “We trained but there were no trials, which meant we could not compete and know our shortcomings. There was a constant fear that we won’t be prepared [for the Olympics],” she said. For a country that’s won only 24 medals at individual events in Olympics, with over a quarter in wrestling, this was worrying. Fresh elections to the WFI were finally held in December 2023, nearly a year after the protests began. The wrestlers had asked India's sports minister to prevent people associated with Singh from participating in the election. Singh did not contest as he had already served the maximum of three terms. But his close aide Sanjay Singh was elected the chief after a landslide victory. This sparked outrage among women wrestlers. On the same day, Olympic medallist Malik quit the sport in protest. “Even now I get emotional when I think of that moment,” Malik said. “Wrestling took me to such heights, got me love and respect, and I had to give it up.” Young wrestlers were stunned by Malik’s decision – but soon, they were back on the mat. “Sakshi Malik was the reason I took up wrestling,” said Tanu Malik, a 20-year-old wrestler in Haryana state. “So when I saw her crying, I thought to myself, she fought for us, we can’t give up now.” From that day, Tanu Malik decided to work harder. Her training at the state’s all-women Yudhvir Wrestling Academy starts at 04:30. The day starts with a rigorous five-hour fitness session, lifting large truck tyres and practicing wrestling techniques. After a break for food and rest, the women resume training for another five hours in the afternoon. Girls as young as 12 years sweat it out on the mat. In their free time, they talk about  diets and share recipes that would help them stay fit. None of them want to talk about the alleged sexual harassment at academies or the accusations against the former wrestling chief. However, they are determined not to give up. Seema Kharab, a coach, says that contrary to expectations, the number of girls at the academy has not dropped since the protests. “The protests have assured young wrestlers that it is possible to raise their voice, that positive action may be taken and they can get support within the system,” she says. In June, the police charged Brij Bhushan Singh with stalking, harassment, intimidation, and making ""sexually coloured remarks"", but a court granted him bail Meanwhile, the new federation chief, Sanjay Singh, has taken on the mantle. He acknowledged his 30-year relationship with the former chief but dismissed allegations of Brij Bhushan Singh's interference, claiming wrestlers had accepted him as the new head. He said this was evident from the “massive turnout” at national wrestling competitions this year. “No-one will be favoured or discriminated against and each wrestler is dear to me. I am also the father of two daughters and I understand what daughters need,” he added. However, for young women like Tanu Malik, fear has become an inescapable part of being in the profession. “It’s not easy - my parents are constantly worried about sending me to training alone,” she says. “But they have to trust us, otherwise how would things work? It’s like accepting defeat without even fighting.” Others feel deflated and say the protests have come at a huge personal cost for them. Shiksha Kharab, a gold medallist at the Asian Championship, says it caused disruptions in training because of which young wrestlers have lost a crucial year. But Sakshi Malik has no regrets. “The most important thing is to fight,” she said. “I don’t think anybody in any sporting federation would dare to do anything, they now know that harassment can have repercussions.” Hooda says she's nervous about competing with some of the world’s biggest wrestling giants at the Games, but also looking forward to it. “Sakshi Malik used to say victory and loss are not important - just trust your hard work. That’s what I will do,” she adds. As she gets ready for training, a picture of Sakshi posing with her Olympic medal, beams down at her. “My only focus now is to win a medal” she says. “Who knows, maybe one day I will have my picture next to hers.”",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58grz0020o,"Divya Arya,",2024-07-08 23:11:35,,True
217,Democrats look to Kamala Harris - but could she beat Trump?,"On Saturday afternoon, US Vice-President Kamala Harris sat on stage at a black cultural festival in New Orleans, talking about her life story and what she felt she had achieved in the White House. It was the kind of event that the first female, black and South Asian American vice-president has regularly attended throughout her three-and-a-half years as Joe Biden’s deputy, usually trailed by a small press pack dwarfed by that which follows the president himself. But as panicked Democrats a thousand miles away in Washington weighed replacing 81-year-old Joe Biden as the party’s candidate for November’s election following his woeful and sometimes incomprehensible debate performance against Donald Trump, the number of reporters trailing Ms Harris had swelled to dozens. On stage and through her travels this weekend, the vice-president did not address swirling questions about Mr Biden’s fitness for office and whether he should withdraw and hand the baton to her. But in discussing ambition and how to forge your own path with her audience in New Orleans, she encouraged the crowd not to listen to naysayers. “People in your life will tell you, though, it’s not your time. It’s not your turn. Nobody like you has done it before,"" she said. ""Don’t you ever listen to that."" Since the disastrous CNN debate on 27 June, she has repeatedly defended her boss, arguing that his record as president shouldn’t be outweighed by 90 minutes on a debate stage. Mr Biden himself has struck a defiant tone and fiercely insisted that he will remain the nominee. Yet as calls grow louder for the president to step aside, some high-profile Democrats are unifying behind 59-year-old Ms Harris as the natural candidate to replace him. On Sunday, congressman Adam Schiff of California told NBC's Meet The Press that either Mr Biden had to be able to “win overwhelmingly or he has to pass the torch to someone who can”. Kamala Harris, he added, could “very well win overwhelmingly” against Trump. That’s a proposition that has raised eyebrows among some Democrats, including Biden allies, who see in Ms Harris a vice-president who failed in her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination before the first ballot was even cast and who has struggled with an uneven record and low approval ratings throughout her time in the White House. Against that, senior Democratic lawmakers like Mr Schiff and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn have been floating Ms Harris as the obvious successor should Mr Biden ultimately bow to party pressure. Supporters point to a handful of polls that suggest she would perform better than the president in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump, and they argue she has the national profile, campaign infrastructure and appeal to younger voters that could make the transition seamless four months before election day. An elevation to the top of the ticket would be a remarkable turnaround for a woman not long ago seen as a political weakness by senior figures in the Biden White House. Even Mr Biden himself reportedly described her as a “work in progress"" during their first months in office. But Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist and Harris’s former communications director, said she had long been underestimated. “Whether she’s a partner to the president or she has to lead the ticket, she is somebody who Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,” Mr Simmons told the BBC. Since the debate and its fall-out, Ms Harris has altered her schedule to stick close to the president. She appeared at a heavily-scrutinised meeting last Wednesday where Mr Biden sought to reassure powerful Democratic governors about his fitness for office. And a day later, on the Fourth of July - America’s Independence Day - she abandoned her usual tradition of grilling hotdogs for firefighters and Secret Service agents at her Los Angeles home to be by Mr Biden’s side at the White House celebrations. The former top prosecutor has focused on criticising Trump in public appearances since the debate, pressing the case as to why voters should believe he is a threat to democracy and women’s rights. At the same time, she has offered nothing but steadfast support for Mr Biden. Vice-presidents always need to strike a delicate balancing act between ambition and loyalty, but Ms Harris knows that this is not a moment where she can show any daylight between her and the president. Kamala Harris is, however, far from the only alternative to Mr Biden being discussed. The list of potential Biden replacements ranges from a cadre of popular governors - Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Illinois’ JB Pritzker - to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California congressman Ro Khanna. Ms Harris and her staff have refused to engage in public speculation. But her team is keenly aware of the behind-the-scenes conversations taking place as some party members coalesce behind her. A memo circulated online, purportedly written by Democratic operatives, laid out a detailed argument to promote Ms Harris despite her “real political weaknesses”. Trying to choose anyone other than her would throw the campaign into disarray and keep ""Democratic bickering"" in the media spotlight for months, it argues. If Mr Biden were to give up the nomination, the idea of the Democrats passing over Ms Harris in favour of another candidate appalls many on the left of the party and in its powerful black caucus. In that situation, ""this party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms Harris"", Mr Clyburn, one of the most prominent black lawmakers in Congress, told MSNBC last week. Republicans, too, have acknowledged Ms Harris would be the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned on Sunday that Republicans must be ready for a “dramatically different race” should Ms Harris - whom he described as a “vigorous” candidate - become the nominee. Mr Graham emphasised her progressive California brand, suggesting she was closer in policy terms to left-wing firebrand Bernie Sanders than Joe Biden, in what appeared to be a glimpse of a Republican attack line should she become the candidate. For his part, Donald Trump has called her “pathetic” in the days since the debate. But ultimately the only question that matters for many Democrats - including deep-pocketed donors - is if she has a better chance of beating Trump than Joe Biden does. And that is deeply uncertain. Harris backers point to a recent CNN poll suggesting she would fare better than the president against Trump in November. In a head-to-head contest, Ms Harris trailed the Republican by only two points, while Mr Biden lagged six points behind him. The poll also suggested Ms Harris performed better than Mr Biden with independent voters and women. But many polling experts dismiss such hypothetical surveys, noting voter sentiment would change if Mr Biden actually decided to step aside and the Democrats entertained other potential candidates. One Democratic pollster close to the Biden campaign acknowledged that Ms Harris may have more potential to expand the party’s voter base than the president, but was sceptical about how much of a difference she would make. Surveys pitting her against Trump at this stage “don’t mean anything”, said the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Ms Harris, the child of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, performs better in surveys than Mr Biden with black, Latino and young voters - critical constituencies that allies say she could energise as the nominee. But whether she would actually boost turnout among younger voters of colour is another uncertain question. “This is just a wait and see moment,” the pollster said. Some in the party are also asking whether Ms Harris’ progressive reputation risks losing the union and blue-collar voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that Mr Biden narrowly won in 2020 and which both parties need to secure a win in November. Should she take over the ticket, some Democrats have suggested that Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina could be picked as running mate to capture centrist voters in Midwestern states. Given the ages of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, voters are paying far more attention to the VP candidate of both parties in this election cycle, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for the 2020 Biden campaign. On the Republican side, Trump has yet to announce his running mate, although many speculate he’ll pick North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Ohio Senator JD Vance. Deep concerns among some Democrats about Harris's strength as a presidential candidate date back to her unsuccesful 2020 bid for the party's nomination, in which she landed blows on Mr Biden in an early debate but then crashed out before the first caucuses in Iowa. Critics said she struggled to define herself as a candidate, a sentiment that has lingered throughout her tenure as vice-president. She had a shaky start in the White House, marked by high-profile interview slip-ups, low approval ratings and staff turnover. She was also tasked with overseeing the administration’s strategy to reduce migration over the US southern border, which increased to record levels over the last three years and remains a major vulnerability for the campaign. Those early stumbles led Ms Harris to be more cautious about her public appearances but many voters perceive her as ineffective and absent. “People need to know more about her, what economic issues she is strong on and they need to be reminded of the role she’s played,” Ms Lake said. Over the last year, Ms Harris has found stable footing as the administration’s leading voice on abortion rights, an issue that proved successful for Democrats during the 2022 midterm elections and one the party hopes will win back more voters in November. As a former prosecutor who handled sexual violence cases, she has invoked personal stories of working with women who miscarried in the bathroom or were turned away at hospitals as she’s tried to mobilise voters around the issue. On the campaign trail, she has also sought to capitalise on other issues that resonate with young voters, including student debt forgiveness, climate change and gun violence. The White House, too, has made a concerted effort to promote her more forcefully. Still, she faces an uphill battle to change longstanding voter scepticism - her approval ratings hover around 37% in polling averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight - a level similar to both Mr Biden and Trump. And unless Mr Biden himself caves to the mounting party pressure to step down, grassroots Democratic supporters themselves seem resigned to supporting the current ticket. At the Essence festival in New Orleans, Iam Christian Tucker, a 41-year-old small business owner from New Orleans, said she didn’t care, ultimately, who the nominee was. She said she liked Kamala Harris, but she wasn’t sure if a black female president could win election. “I’m voting against Donald Trump more than anything,” she told the BBC. Greg Hovel, 67, who attended a rally for President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, last week, said he supported Ms Harris in the 2020 primary and “has always been a fan,” though he cautioned there is “a lot of anti-woman sentiment in this country.” “I think she would make an excellent president,” Mr Hovel said. “But I still think Biden can win.” Mike Wendling contributed to this report from Madison, Wisconsin  BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

231,Biden's bruising day sinks hopes Democrats will move on,"The most devastating argument against Joe Biden’s re-election bid may have come not from a politician or a pundit, but from a film star. But George Clooney, with his stinging New York Times opinion piece, isn’t the only one speaking out. A growing chorus from Democrats is sinking the president’s hopes of steadying his campaign this week – and perhaps ever. Just when it appeared he had turned a corner, with the influential Congressional Black Caucus and key liberal members of Congress voicing their support for him, the ground has shifted once again – and all in the midst of a high-profile Nato summit with US allies here in Washington. Now the stakes for Mr Biden’s press conference at the end of the Nato summit tomorrow afternoon are even higher. It will be the biggest unscripted test for him since his botched debate two weeks prior which triggered this crisis. Mr Biden also has a sit-down interview scheduled with NBC News presenter Lester Holt on Monday. A fumble or misstep in the days ahead could buttress all the most damaging assertions Mr Clooney, a top Democratic fundraiser, makes in his New York Times piece.  The actor writes that the president's decline is not an illusion; it’s real. He points to a Los Angeles fundraiser he threw for the president last month. “The Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe... of 2010,” he writes. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” The president is not up to the task of beating Donald Trump in November, Clooney continues. He calls the Biden campaign’s claim that he is the choice of Democratic primary voters “disingenuous, at best”. And, perhaps most devastating, he says every prominent Democrat he has spoken with knows all this – whether they’re willing to publicly admit it or not. “We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November"", he writes, “or we can speak the truth.” The Biden campaign is pushing back against the Clooney piece, noting that the president had flown across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in Italy, to attend the star’s fundraiser.  Campaign officials also note that the president has had serious disagreements recently with the star and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, about his administration’s Gaza policy. The opinion piece, published three weeks after that Los Angeles fundraiser, could be viewed like a strike timed for maximum effect. But Clooney isn’t just any movie star. He’s a powerful fundraiser for Democrats and has been for years. Given that California, and the Hollywood industry in particular, is a key part of the party’s money base, Clooney’s comments present a very real threat to Mr Biden.  It also comes on the heels of expressions of dissatisfaction from other big-money Democratic donors, such as Netflix chair Reed Hastings and IAC chair Barry Diller. The actor is also plugged in to party politics, with close ties to former President Barack Obama. It is difficult to imagine that he would have taken to the pages of the New York Times in such a dramatic way, with a double-barrel blast against the sitting president, without at least some tacit sign-off from prominent Democrats. And, increasingly, prominent Democrats are saying things that should give Mr Biden pause.  On Wednesday morning, hours before Clooney's opinion piece was published, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi - who still holds considerable influence within the party - stopped notably short of endorsing his bid for re-election. She said the president’s critics should hold their tongues until after this week’s Nato summit. “Whatever you're thinking,” she said, “you didn't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.” She added that Mr Biden should make a decision quickly about whether to continue his campaign. When prodded that the president had already clearly said he would stay in the race, she dodged. “I want him to do whatever he decides to do,” Mrs Pelosi said. And later in the day, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine – Hillary Clinton’s vice-presidential running mate in 2016 – offered similar lines, about how the president “will do the patriotic thing for the country” and “make that decision”. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, put it even more bluntly: “I’m fully behind him as our nominee until he’s not our nominee.” It’s as if Mr Biden’s tepid supporters simply won’t take “yes, I’m still running” as an answer. Meanwhile, even some of Mr Biden’s staunchest supporters have started to engage in “what if” scenarios. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he still backs the president, and would not run against Vice-President Kamala Harris as the nominee if Mr Biden stepped aside. Senate Democrats are meeting Biden campaign officials on Thursday to discuss the future of the campaign. And Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said he would speak to the president directly about Democratic concerns by Friday. Wheels are turning, but it's unclear whether they are grinding toward a resolution or spinning in place. If Mr Biden were to bow out, it’s still unclear what happens next. Some have suggested that Ms Harris, as the president’s running mate, is next in line. The solution, according to Clooney, is for Democrats to regroup and pick a new nominee, although he is vague about how the process could unfold. And his suggestion that, because of the shortened campaign season, whoever the party chooses would be able to avoid opposition research and negative campaigning – either from fellow Democrats or Republicans – seems naive in the extreme. While the mood in Washington has taken a new turn against the president in the past 24 hours, the mathematics of his situation has not changed. Mr Biden still controls the lion’s share of national convention delegates who ultimately decide the party’s presidential ticket. And while those delegates aren’t explicitly bound to support him, he could replace any who show insufficient loyalty. The opinion polls, while indicating he is trailing Trump, have not changed dramatically since his ill-fated debate. And few show any of the most obvious alternatives to him – the vice-president and prominent Democratic governors – doing substantially better. Even Mr Biden’s critics, with their appeals to his patriotism, sense of duty and concern for American democracy given the potential for a second Trump presidency, implicitly acknowledge that the decision ultimately lies with him. What Wednesday demonstrated, though, is that if he presses ahead, he may never be able to fully put the concerns about his age behind him.

242,NBA star to become first black Greek Olympic flagbearer,"Greek basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo is to become the first black athlete to bear the flag for Greece at the Olympics. The two-time NBA MVP will carry the flag alongside race walker Antigoni Ntrismpioti in Paris on 26 July. The Greek men’s basketball team qualified for its first Olympic Games since 2008, after beating Croatia in front of a home crowd in Piraeus on Sunday. The 29-year-old, who was drafted by Milwaukee Bucks in 2013 and led them to the 2021 NBA title, was in tears after the game.  ""It's an incredible feeling,"" he said after qualification. ""Since I was a kid I always wanted to play in the Olympic Games."" His journey to become Greece's Olympic flagbearer hasn't been an easy one. Antetokounmpo's parents emigrated to Greece from Nigeria. For the first 18 years of his life, Antetokounmpo could not travel outside Greece and was effectively stateless, having no papers either from Greece or Nigeria. He was eventually issued Greek citizenship in May 2013, less than two months before the NBA draft. Antetokounmpo spoke about his childhood in a recent interview with ESPN.  ""I used to sell things since I can remember myself, since I was six or seven years old. “I was always out of home trying as much as I could to help my mom and dad by selling watches, glasses, CDs, DVDs, and everything I could find. I was doing that until I turned 17 because I had to. I had no other choice. When I was selling all those things, I was the best seller."" But even after becoming a star in the US, Antetokounmpo encountered racism at home.  In a TNT documentary in 2020, he said: ""Greece is a country of white people, life can be difficult for someone with the colour of my skin. Or of another nationality. You go to a lot of neighbourhoods, and you face a lot of racism."" There was a backlash to his comments from some in Greece, including Konstantinos Kalemis, then-coordinator for refugee education in the Malakasa camp north of Athens, who used a range of racial slurs against Antetokounmpo and was fired as a result.  He has also faced discrimination from government officials. In 2018, Adonis Georgiadis, the current health minister, repeatedly mispronounced his name and falsely claimed he had been born in Africa instead of Greece. Antetokounmpo will be one of the first athletes to open the Games, as Greece - the birthplace of the Olympics - traditionally leads the parade. Spyros Kapralos, president of the Greek Olympic Committee, said there was ""unanimity"" in the decision for Antetokounmpo to carry the flag in Paris. He added that both flagbearers will ""lift our country high"". Antetokounmpo hasn't publicly commented yet, but simply posted a video to X showing highlights from the qualifying campaign with the word ""Greece"".

234,What are cognitive tests and what can they tell us about Biden and Trump?,"Age and mental fitness recently have become a leading issue in the US presidential race.  While the issue has loomed over President Joe Biden, 81, and his opponent Donald Trump, 78, in the past, things reached a tipping point after Biden's weak debate performance late last month.  Mr Biden is the oldest president in US history and Trump, if elected, would be the second oldest.  Mr Biden, during an interview with ABC News, refused to commit to taking a cognitive test, saying he has ""a cognitive test every day"" and his doctors say he doesn't need one.  Trump has said he has completed cognitive tests, one while he was president, and another more recently. He said he aced both.  Here's what the tests are, their purpose and how hard they are to pass.  There are different tests and screenings to measure how well the brain is functioning.  They don't determine a specific disease, but help signal if additional tests are needed for diagnosis, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  Typically, a cognitive screening could be warranted if a person is having problems with memory, personality changes, or balance, or if they are repeating themself, forgetting parts of their past or having problems understanding information.  One of the most widely used tests is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a quick way to ""assess cognitive skills in people with suspected deficits,"" according to Sanford Medicine.  The assessment tests orientation, memory, attention and the ability to name objects, and follow verbal and written commands. It's also available online.  It's typically easy for someone without cognitive impairment, but is harder for those declining mentally.  The creator of the test, Canadian neurologist Ziad Nasreddine, told the BBC that he thought the test could be good for Biden - both as a way to reassure Americans and in case there is a problem.  In brief cognitive tests, medical professionals ask patients a variety of learning and memory questions. Longer clinical evaluations include cognitive tests plus a physical and neurological exam and a full history of a patient.  The latter could paint a clearer picture of the cognitive abilities of both Mr Biden and Trump, said Dan Mungas, an associate director of the University of California's Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.  Often medical professions will start with a brief test, such as the MoCa, and if their score is lower than expected, they move to a more comprehensive examination.  More in-depth tests assess language, executive function and visual-spatial abilities.  For example, a medical professional may read a story to a patient then ask them to recall parts of the story to test memory and learning abilities.  A patient might be asked to recall a list of words, name objects in pictures or name items that start with a specific letter.  In addition to questioning the patient, Dr Mungas suggests speaking with people who spend time with the patient regularly to determine symptoms of cognitive decline. Dr Mungas said it is important to see if someone's abilities have changed over time, adding that a one-time assessment can be misleading.   ""You have to understand where a person started out, if they're declining from where they've been before, that's a bad sign,"" he said.  But he notes, cognitive tests are not everything.  ""The idea that there’s a simple cognitive test that says this person's going to be a good president doesn’t make any sense and I’ve been doing cognitive testing all my career,” Dr Mungas said.  The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends doctors assess people older than 65 for their cognitive abilities. That determination was made because as age increases, so does the likelihood of impairments, Dr Nasreddine told the BBC.  By age 75, 25% of patients will have a cognitive disorder of some kind, he warned.  ""It becomes extremely frequent that cognitive impairment is present, and sometimes it’s present without people realising it’s present,” said Dr Nasreddine, who has neither treated nor met the president. He said he has noticed a change in Mr Biden in the past year. In public appearances, the president moves slowly, his speech has slowed, his voice is very low, and he mumbles and slurs some words, he said.  Not many people have such an intense job at Mr Biden's age, he noted, and it is difficult to describe the normal function of someone at that age. ""I haven't seen this [decline] in previous years, only in the past year I have seen this,"" he said.   Dr Nasreddine noted that, despite only being three years younger, Trump seems more vigorous.  The 25th Amendment of the US Constitution lays out the line of succession and procedure if a president dies or is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"".  The amendment notes it should be used if a president is removed from office, incapacitated, dies or resigns.  The amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy but has become a topic of debate in recent years.  Congressional lawmakers eyed legislation during Trump's presidency that would alter the amendment to enable a panel of medical experts to determine a president's fitness for office.  Democrats also approved a House resolution after the US Capitol riots in 2021 that called for then-Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.  Neither move went anywhere.  Following Mr Biden's debate performance, some Republicans have called on members of his cabinet to invoke the clause.  Section 4 of the amendment states if the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet or Congress deem the president is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,"" then the vice-president would take office.  It has never been used or tested in the case of mental decline. ",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngrlnlr08o,"Ana Faguy and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-09 23:09:52,,True
263,Biden introduces Zelensky as Putin before high-stakes news conference,"Gary O'DonoghueSenior North America correspondent Joe Biden is set to field questions from reporters about his fitness to run for president again, as more Democrats join calls for him to step aside.  The news conference at the end of the Nato summit in Washington tonight will be the president's most unscripted appearance since the debate with Donald Trump last month, in which he appeared to lose his train of thought several times.  In many ways, the White House has set the president an impossible task - a press conference on which everything now seems to ride. It's his first in eight months - and few would argue that Biden was a gaffe-free performer even at the height of his powers.  The problem he faces is that so much has already been said that it would require a performance of gargantuan proportion to turn around this seemingly inexorable narrative. But Biden is hoping he has managed to shore up support domestically and quieted dissent within his own party, after sending his advisers to meet Democratic senators ahead of the event. The loyalists - an ever-diminishing number - continue to argue the party is best placed to stick with Biden as their nominee.  That optimism feels like clutching at straws, however. Political leadership can evaporate in a moment, and Joe Biden is just having too many of those moments right now.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2v0nzx16gzt,Unknown,Unknown,,True
275,Can Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily,"Knives are out for Joe Biden after his poorly received performance in the first 2024 presidential debate against Donald Trump.  With November's election bearing down, a growing number of Democrats are calling on the president to step aside due to concerns about his mental fitness.  Around a dozen Democrats have publicly broken ranks and called for Mr Biden to step aside to be replaced by someone younger from his party. Mr Biden has defiantly vowed to stay in the race, including during public events and in interviews with ABC News and MSNBC.   Unless he agrees to stand aside, it will get ugly.  Let's run through the scenarios. Yes, if - and it's a big if - Mr Biden decides to step down as the Democratic Party's standard bearer, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are reportedly planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually ahead of that gathering. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of ""delegates"" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election.  This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are ""pledged"" to support the incumbent president.  If Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all.  Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes.  That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination.  Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside.  But if he decides to do so, ""that opens up an entirely different can of worms"", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News.   ""I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,"" she said.   If he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination.  However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out.  The rules allow delegates to ""in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them"", meaning they could look to someone else. ""It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,"" Ms Wright Rigueur said.  Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for re-election. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results.  Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention.  Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. It may be that Mr Biden backs her to replace him if he steps aside. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris would have access to all the campaign funds currently available to the president. And she has a national profile. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage.   The 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows the US vice-president and the majority of the cabinet to declare the president unable to perform the duties of office.  If invoked, power is transferred to the vice-president to serve as acting president.   This has never happened before.  But following the debate, senior congressional Republicans called on Mr Biden's cabinet to consider invoking this clause.  After the US Capitol riot in 2021, the Democratic-controlled House approved a resolution urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump, but the move went nowhere.",2024-07-11 23:11:16,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv821nljwo,"Christal Hayes, Holly Honderich & Rachel Looker,",2024-07-11 22:11:16,,True
279,Anger in Egypt after crash cyclist picked for Olympics,"With just two weeks to go until the Paris 2024 Olympics begin, many Egyptians are debating the decision to select as a competitor a cyclist who collided with a rival team-mate who was knocked into a cement barrier. In April, cyclist Ganna Eliwa, 19, was left concussed and with a broken right collarbone and severe cuts and bruises to the right-hand side of her body, according to a medical report, after she was pushed off her bike 300m (980ft) before the finishing line. In video of the incident, her opponent, Shahd Saeed, also 19, is seen riding behind Eliwa before she swerves, forcing Eliwa into the barrier. The latter underwent an operation to fix her right shoulder, suffered temporary loss of memory and is still unable to resume her business. Saeed said a couple of times that it was an accident, but Eliwa says her opponent never apologised for what happened. It is unclear what caused Saeed to swerve into the other rider. After an investigation into the incident, the Egyptian Cycling Federation suspended Saeed from the sport for one year and fined her the equivalent of $100 (£77) - the maximum penalty. Despite this, they still registered her name among the competitors in the Paris Olympics track cycling, causing public anger in Egypt. On Facebook, users swarmed the account of the federation, appealing to it to strike Saeed’s name off the list of competitors. One comment read: “Best of luck to all participants except for the rider who pushed her colleague. She’s not the best person to represent Egypt.” Eliwa also featured prominently on night-time talk shows, wishing Saeed bad luck. “I hope she can take part in the Paris Olympics because I’m pretty sure she would come last,” she told one TV presenter. The president of the Egyptian Cycling Federation said Saeed’s participation in the Olympics was “in favour of Egypt”, noting that the organisation could not remove her because it was too late to replace her. Many commentators compared Saeed to Mohammed Ali Rashwan, an Egyptian judoka who prized fair play above a gold medal at the Los Angles Olympics in 1984. ""By refusing to attack his opponent’s clearly injured right leg, the Egyptian judoka lost an obvious opportunity to be crowned Olympic champion, but instead he won worldwide acclaim and inner peace,” some quoted the International Olympic Committee as saying about Rashwan. Others said the choice of Saeed violated the three values of Olympism - excellence, respect and friendship - and urged authorities to reconsider their decision. Prompted by the criticism, the ministry of sports asked the Egyptian Olympic Committee to examine Saeed’s participation in Paris 2024 in light of “international accords and ethical rules”. After maintaining a long silence under fire, Saeed told a local newspaper this incident was in the past, questioning why it was raised again before the games. She again reiterated the incident was not “deliberate”. Cycling is not a popular sport in Egypt, but President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi frequently encourages men and women to get on their bikes.  He has been pictured numerous times leading hundreds of cyclists, including public figures, on a rally through Cairo at dawn.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwynzgxvzzo,"Wael Hussein,",2024-07-11 19:11:17,,True
282,Carla Bruni-Sarkozy charged with witness tampering,"France's former first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has been charged over an election funding scandal dating back to 2007 involving cash from the then Libyan dictator, Col Muammar Gaddafi. According to French media, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, 56, was charged with hiding evidence and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud. She was placed under judicial control and barred from being in contact with all those accused except her husband, Nicolas Sarkozy.  Ms Bruni-Sarkozy is also suspected of concealment of witness tampering and involvement in an attempt to bribe Lebanese judicial personnel, among other violations. Her lawyers told AFP that Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was determined to assert her rights and challenge the ""unfounded decision"". Mr Sarkozy, who was the president of France from 2007 to 2012, is due to go on trial next year over allegations he took money from Gaddafi to finance his successful election bid. He is accused of corruption, illegal campaign financing, benefiting from embezzled public funds and membership in a criminal conspiracy. He has always denied all the charges. The investigation into the allegations was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then leader Gaddafi, first accused Mr Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding. The following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East, supported the claims. He told judges he had written proof that Mr Sarkozy's campaign bid was ""abundantly"" financed by Tripoli, and that the €50m (£43m) worth of payments continued after he became president. Years later, Mr Takieddine told French media that in 2006-07 he had personally handed over suitcases stuffed with banknotes to Mr Sarkozy and his chief of staff, Claude Guéant, who later denied this. But in 2020, Mr Takieddine suddenly retracted his statement about handing over large amounts of money. This raised suspicions that Mr Sarkozy and his allies - including his wife - might have paid him to change his mind. In June, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was found to have deleted messages exchanged with a French businesswoman who was questioned by police over accusations of witness tampering. Since losing his re-election bid to socialist François Hollande in 2012, Mr Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations. In 2023, he was given a suspended prison sentence for trying to bribe a judge, and earlier this year, he was found guilty of illegally funding his 2012 re-election campaign. He and Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, an Italian-born former supermodel and singer, married in 2008.

297,Many Democrats are sticking with Biden. Here's why,"Headlines scream for Joe Biden to quit. Donors threaten to withhold campaign funds, and a growing list of Democrats call time on the president's career. But for all the stories dominated by the latest politician, fundraiser or left-wing actor to voice their displeasure, a longer list of Democrats are sticking by him. At least 80 Democratic politicians have publicly backed the 81-year-old, and more are joining them as he insists he is going nowhere.  To many, his political record, his principles and his 2020 victory over Donald Trump mean more than the damage of a rambling performance in any debate or public appearance, or health fears during a new four-year term. Mr Biden's first solo news conference of the year on Thursday, though hampered by mistakes, sparked several more public expressions of support. “Tonight, President Biden was knowledgeable, engaging, and capable,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on social media afterwards. “No one is more prepared to lead our nation forward than Joe Biden.” Gavin Newsom, the California governor touted as a possible successor, told CBS on Friday he was ""all in"" for Mr Biden, adding that there was ""no daylight"" between them. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said Mr Biden ""showed he knows a million times more about policy"" than Trump, ""the convict conman"". Experts say these politicians have a host of reasons for their support, including Mr Biden's record in office, his 2020 victory against Trump and the gamble of putting in a new candidate so close to the November election.  ""The president has made it clear he wants to continue to run, and I think people are being very respectful of that,"" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist. ""And it's also true that in our system, replacing a candidate for president this late is hard and is unprecedented, and so there's enormous reticence about making a big change."" He added that there was a ""healthy debate"" about who the nominee should be. However, a range of groups have said that the candidate should be Mr Biden, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr Biden met earlier this week.  Ameshia Cross, a former Obama campaign adviser, said that the black caucus, as well as many black voters, see Mr Biden as a president committed to civil rights, unlike his rival, Trump.  ""They understand what is at stake with a Donald J Trump presidency,"" she said. ""This is a guy who has stood against DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.""  Mr Biden has received public support from several politicians on the left, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have previously criticised Mr Biden for an agenda they have said is not progressive enough.  Ms Cross said many recognise the risks a Trump presidency brings to civil and LGBTQ rights, and climate change. ""These are things that matter to the progressive left, and the president has actually worked on those things,"" she said.  To date, most of Mr Biden's support comes from politicians running for re-election in safer districts, rather than those who worry Mr Biden could harm their own election chances in tougher seats. Mr Rosenberg said that the White House ""needs to be respectful of their concerns and deal with them, I think, in a far more aggressive manner"". Even as calls grow for Mr Biden to exit the race, the most recent poll seems to suggest that he has not lost much voter support.  The Biden campaign has touted a survey from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos published this week, which shows Mr Biden and Trump in a dead-heat, similar to survey results from before the debate. But the poll also found two-thirds of Americans want Mr Biden to step aside.  Mr Biden has also lost support from some donors, including Democratic fundraiser and actor George Clooney, who wrote a damning op-ed this week calling on Mr Biden to step down.  Other top donors, however, are sticking by the president.  Shekar Narasimhan, who has been organising fundraisers for Democrats for more than two decades, said there had been no change in his plans. ""Our eyes can see what’s going on, our ears can hear what's being talked about but we are keeping our heads down to get the work done,"" said Mr Narsimhan, who is the founder of the Asian American Pacific Islander Victory Fund Super-PAC. ""It's the president’s decision to make, whether he wants to run or not, and we will go with whatever he decides,"" he said. ""But it's better to end this discussion as soon as possible."" He said his support for Mr Biden came from the belief that he would win. ""This election will be decided by no more than a total of 50,000 votes in three states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - and we have the ground game and infrastructure to win there,"" he said. Frank Islam, who sits on the National Finance Committee, said he had a fundraiser planned at his Maryland home later this month.

327,Biden is teetering. Trump's plan? Let it happen,"As Joe Biden attempted to calm the storm engulfing his presidential re-election campaign, he hit an early snag: referring to ""Vice-President Trump"" during a Thursday press conference when he meant Kamala Harris. Within minutes, Donald Trump mocked the gaffe on his social media platform, Truth Social, with an accompanying clip. ""Great job, Joe!"" he wrote. It was the kind of reaction voters have come to expect from Trump, who has spent years insulting the president, 81. And yet, for the past two weeks, as Mr Biden was fighting for his political life, Trump remained uncharacteristically quiet, letting Democrats argue among themselves. Republican strategists claim the relative silence is down to Trump's new-found discipline - a change from his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. ""He's played it brilliantly by not saying much about the Democratic crisis,"" said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former senior Senate and House leadership aide. ""Why take the shovel away when they're digging their own hole?"" Trump, 78, has not gone entirely underground. Since Mr Biden's poor debate performance in late June, Trump has given a handful of radio interviews, appeared at rallies in Virginia and Florida, and kept up a steady drumbeat of posts on Truth Social. ""The radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos,"" Trump said at a Tuesday campaign rally in Miami. ""They can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president, sleepy, crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala."" He also challenged  the president to a golf match, claimed all US airports were dirty, said that visitors to Washington DC end up ""shot, mugged and raped"", claimed 45,000 people were at the Miami event when there were closer to 700, and pondered why ""we don't eat bacon anymore"". But experts say that compared to past behaviour, the Republican has been restrained. Some have suggested Trump's camp may even be delaying his choice for vice-president to avoid stealing attention from Mr Biden's problems. ""If you compare this strategy and execution [in] this campaign to 2016 and 2020, it is far more strategic, far more disciplined,""  said Kevin Madden, a Republican communications expert who worked on Mitt Romney’s presidential bids. With the Democratic Party fracturing over Mr Biden's candidacy, Corey Lewandowski, Trump's 2016 campaign manager, said the approach taken by Trump since the debate had been effective. ""The Trump campaign has done an outstanding job of allowing the Biden campaign to self-destruct,"" he said. That implosion may have been what the Trump campaign was banking on from the start. The Republican plan to win over the American people has, for a while now, leaned on voters' well-documented fears about Mr Biden's age. Speaking to The Atlantic's Tim Alberta, Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita said he had planned for an ""extraordinarily visual"" match-up where Mr Biden was viewed as old and frail while Trump appeared strong and vigorous. ""The debate was exactly what they wanted,"" Mr Madden said. ""They got the perfect split-screen that was going to endure."" A number of recent polls put Trump consistently - if still narrowly - ahead of Mr Biden. But there is concern within the Trump camp that anxiety over Mr Biden's fitness has peaked too soon. Were he to be replaced by a younger nominee, Trump would lose two main lines of attack - age and frailty. And it would be harder to directly blame a new candidate for the president's perceived policy failures: Mr Biden scores badly with voters on the economy and the southern border crisis. ""They're silently hoping, with their fingers crossed, that Biden is the nominee,"" said strategist Ron Bonjean of Trump's campaign. ""They feel they will win the election with Biden as their opponent."" Some of Trump's closest surrogates have seemed to suggest they want Mr Biden to stay on. On Thursday, while Democrats parsed the impact of the president's defiant press conference, Trump's son Don Jr offered rare praise. Mr Biden's performance had been ""not too bad"", he said. ""He did fine enough to be able to stay in it - he doesn't want to go.""  Last week, Trump's daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Lara Trump, suggested it would ""go against the democratic process"" if Mr Biden were to be removed. Nevertheless, Mr Bonjean and other Republican experts made clear that if it was hard for Republicans to take on a new candidate, it would be harder still for Democrats to choose one. ""Yes, it will cause the Trump campaign to scramble a little bit. But their scrambling is not nearly what it will be for the Democrats,"" said Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist who served as chief of staff to former House majority leader Eric Cantor. ""They have to figure out how to nominate somebody else… they have to build a brand-new structure from scratch."" Meanwhile, Republicans are combing through records of Ms Harris and other possible replacements, he said. ""They're not prepared, necessarily, for this, but they are preparing."" Next week, at the Republican party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Trump will reclaim centre stage, officially accepting his party's nomination and making a primetime speech that will set the tone for the final months of his campaign. Mr Heye suggested that the convention - four days of party fanfare built around a candidate who revels in the spotlight - will have made it easier to sell Trump the benefits of the strategy of remaining largely quiet. ""If you're committed to keeping your candidate under wraps for an extended period, there has to be a pay-out later on,"" he said. ""His leadership can say: 'You've got all of next week, it's going to be the Donald Trump show'.""",2024-07-13 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd17yd3jq4ro,"Holly Honderich,",2024-07-13 02:09:08,,True
331,Trump rushed off stage at rally as bangs heard,"Secret Service agents have rushed former President Donald Trump off stage after what sounded like gunshots rang out at a rally in Pennsylvania. Footage showed him grimace and raise a hand to his ear, before ducking as sharp cracks - apparently shots - broke out.  He was quickly swarmed by secret service agents and rushed off stage to a waiting vehicle.  In a statement Trump's campaign said he was ""fine"" and was being ""checked out"" at a local medical facility.  “President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act,” spokesman Steven Cheung said.  The former president appeared to have blood on his right ear and raised a fist as he was led off stage.  Armed police took to the podium soon after.  In a statement, the Secret Service said Trump was safe and that measures for his protection had been implemented.  They added that an active investigation was now under way and that further information would be released when available.  The Republican candidate for president had been addressing his supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania - a crucial swing state in November's election.  Multiple bangs rang out as Trump attacked his successor, President Joe Biden, and his administration.  Several supporters holding placards and standing behind Trump ducked as the apparent shots were heard.  The White House said President Biden, who is in his home state of Delaware, has received an initial briefing.  This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

338,Restrictions on Trump's Facebook and Instagram lifted,"Meta has lifted the final restrictions on Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in the run up to US presidential elections in November. The ex-US president and convicted felon’s accounts were suspended in 2021 after he praised supporters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Trump’s accounts, which combined have over 60 million followers, were re-instated in 2023 but subject to additional monitoring, which has now been removed, the social media giant said in a blog post. Meta said it had a responsibility to allow political expression and that Americans should be able to hear from presidential nominees on an equal basis. It added that US presidential candidates ""remain subject to the same Community Standards as all Facebook and Instagram users, including those policies designed to prevent hate speech and incitement to violence."" Since returning to Meta’s platforms, Trump’s accounts have mostly posted campaign details and memes including attacks on his presidential race rival Joe Biden. Prior to his 2021 ban, Trump’s Facebook posts were often some of the most popular in the US, according to data at the time from CrowdTangle. Trump is the first former president to be convicted of a crime and was also banned from Twitter and YouTube. Restrictions on these accounts were also lifted last year, but despite this Trump communicates now on Truth Social, a social media platform he owns, before reposting to other networks. Trump returned to Twitter - now called X – after the company’s CEO Elon Musk held a poll that asked users to click ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether Trump's account should be reinstated. ""Yes"" won, apparently with 51.8% of the vote. The big tech companies acted after the deadly Capitol Hill riots which injured more than 100 police officers.

352,'Southgate inherited a shambles but now stands one game from greatness',"England manager Gareth Southgate is one game away from history before the Euro 2024 final against Spain England enter the iconic surroundings of Berlin’s Olympiastadion on Sunday night with a place in history the prize that would accompany victory in the Euro 2024 final against Spain. Gareth Southgate’s side must overcome the most impressive side on show in Germany to end a 58-year search for success by the men’s team stretching back to the sunlit day on 30 July 1966 when Sir Alf Ramsey’s side won the World Cup. A total of 457 players have represented England since that day - with 436 debutants - and the country has qualified for 20 major tournaments under 11 managers without ever escaping the storyline of disappointment. Southgate and his players now have the chance to change the narrative forever and there has been a genuine sense of history in the making as England supporters flooded into Berlin, with many making their way to the vast bowl to the west of the city more than 24 hours before kick-off. England, under Southgate, are in a second successive European Championship final and hoping to erase the bitter memories of their defeat on penalties by Italy at Euro 2020. That was a desperate occasion on every level, not simply because of the loss, but also because England’s hope of emerging from the post-Covid era with a landmark victory was overshadowed by events away from the game. What could have been a joyous day was scarred by crowd violence, poor organisation, mass disorder at Wembley as well as in London, then the bleak shadow of racist abuse aimed in the direction of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after they missed in the penalty shootout. Emotions are in sharp contrast as Euro 2024 draws to its conclusion. There is a rediscovered sense of purpose and unity about Southgate’s squad. The fractures with fans, seen in the beer cups and abuse aimed at the manager and players after the draw with Slovenia, have healed. Yet no senior England football team has won a final on foreign soil. Is this finally the time? Why Mainoo has 'wow factor' - and could be one of the greats The youth clubs where England's Euro stars flourished Penalties, red cards and shocks - England's 58 years of hurt Wayne Rooney's broken foot sabotaged England's hopes of winning Euro 2004 England may be second favourites but the past few days have seen the emergence of a “name on the trophy” feeling of destiny, that the time may have finally arrived when a fresh story of success can be told. As Southgate, relaxed and smiling on his final media appearance before the match, said: ""We have a fabulous opportunity that we set out to achieve from the moment we left [the 2022 World Cup in] Qatar a bit earlier than we would have liked to. ""I'm not a believer in fairytales but I believe in dreams and we have big dreams. If we are not afraid of losing it gives us a better chance to win and I want the players to feel that fearlessness."" Those of us chronicling the years of disappointment have witnessed all manner of reasons why England have had their noses pressed up against the window while other countries, most notably huge underdogs Greece at Euro 2004, have enjoyed success that has agonisingly eluded them. In major tournament terms, past history makes the Southgate years seem like a golden era, with a World Cup semi-final, the Euro 2020 final, a World Cup quarter-final, and now this final against Spain on his CV. It is all a far cry from what went before under his predecessors, when high hopes were dashed as England specialised in falling short. England visibly wilted in the stifling heat of Shizuoka on the south coast of Japan when losing the World Cup quarter-final to Brazil in 2002, not helped by manager Sven-Goran Eriksson continuing to select David Beckham when clearly not fully fit - a pattern he would repeat with similar results. The Euros in Portugal two years later was a tale of missed opportunity, ill-luck and “Roomania”, as the 18-year-old Everton phenomenon Wayne Rooney took the global stage by storm. Rooney’s blockbuster display in the opening defeat to France was followed by two-goal performances in wins against Switzerland and Croatia transforming the silent street footballer - no interviews allowed - into a worldwide story. Hotel bedroom phones would ring in the middle of night with outlets from around the world demanding any piece of precious information about the new young superstar. Having attended the same school as Rooney, De La Salle in Liverpool’s Croxteth district, became both a blessing and a curse for me. Sadly it ended in more quarter-final disappointment, Rooney’s broken foot early in the game against hosts Portugal with England leading changed the course of their tournament. England had a team groaning under the weight of world-class talent but the penalty curse struck again, as did Eriksson’s inability to fashion a balanced midfield out of Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes. England or Spain? Sutton's Euro 2024 final prediction 'Why England's story can have a different ending this time' Shops, John Bishop & darts - what is changing because of Euros final? Ezri Konsa, Jude Bellingham and late match-winner Ollie Watkins celebrate the quarter-final win against the Netherlands The tournament in Germany two years later was the World Cup of WAGs, those of us based in the beautiful spa town of Baden-Baden often unable to move around for crowds of photographers and the public making it all an unseemly circus, with Ashley Cole’s then wife Cheryl, Victoria Beckham and Colleen Rooney garnering as many, if not more, headlines as England’s performances. In another Eriksson Groundhog Day, England went out on penalties to Portugal. A frustrated and not match-fit Rooney - who arrived at the team base having been declared fit after another foot injury with the words ""the big man is back in town"" - was sent off for stamping on defender Ricardo Carvalho then sent on his way with Cristiano Ronaldo’s infamous wink. But if measured by unrelenting misery, the 2010 World Cup in South Africa may well be the winner. Fabio Capello lead a campaign that mirrored his countenance - grim, austere and discontented, the Italian choosing to base England in a gilded cage at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace outside Rustenburg. Isolated in the extreme, the monastic strategy inside “Camp Capello” failed in every respect, from Rio Ferdinand’s serious knee injury on the first day of training to the undignified sight of England’s manager bellowing at a photographer before a training session in the mistaken belief he was taking unauthorised shots. The unhappiness and boredom blew up in an explosive press conference when John Terry appeared to challenge Capello’s authority, even demanding the inclusion of then Chelsea team-mate Joe Cole, and Rooney admitting the day consisted of “breakfast, training, lunch, bed, dinner, bed” before adding: “There are only so many games of darts and snooker you can play.” Terry’s complaints about the camp were painted as an attempted coup by someone who was no longer captain but whose words carried merit, even if making them public was described as a “big mistake” by Capello. It ended with a 4-1 thrashing against Germany in the last 16, England so poor that even Frank Lampard’s wrongly disallowed goal could not be used as a figleaf to disguise a truly rotten tournament. Whenever the story of Southgate’s time in charge is told, it must be within the context of the extended shambles he inherited from Capello, Roy Hodgson and then the “blink and you’ll miss it” 67-day reign of Sam Allardyce. Harry Kane has his sights on following Sir Bobby Moore as only the second England captain to lift a major trophy for the men's team Hodgson’s time in charge ended minutes after the humiliation of a last-16 exit to Iceland at Euro 2016 in France - an embarrassment so complete that some members of the media who ran from the press box at the final whistle still did not arrive in time to hear his resignation announcement. In the final twist of farce, we watched in disbelief as Hodgson had to be persuaded to appear for a final media briefing, seemingly believing that as he was no longer England manager he was not expected to explain the events surrounding a mind-numbingly bad performance. Hodgson entered a room at England’s base at Chantilly with the words: “I don’t really know what I’m doing here.” After the manner in which England’s campaign was conducted, it was both comedy gold and the perfect epitaph for those few weeks in France. This was, after the brief Allardyce era, the mess Southgate was required to piece together again, explaining why he deserves respect for what he has accomplished, irrespective of Sunday’s outcome. Southgate has given England credibility and respectability, rehabilitating them as a global force. Only the win is missing, but now Southgate's England have the chance to finally end the years of hurt in magnificent, iconic surroundings Victory in Berlin would be Southgate’s crowning achievement, putting him alongside Sir Alf Ramsey in England’s managerial Hall Of Fame, his restoration of the prestige of playing for England not far behind. He has led England to a final many expected them to reach, and win, before the start of the tournament but which has taken a treacherous route forcing them to overcome hazards and some self-inflicted wounds before reaching their intended destination. And so to Berlin’s Olympiastadion, with Southgate and England’s players at the gates of history and a game that could shape legacies and change lives forever.",2024-07-13 23:09:12,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn09240ege7o,Phil McNulty,2024-07-13 22:54:12,,True
354,Secret Service has questions to answer for failing to stop Trump gunman,"The US Secret Service has one primary job - to protect current and former US presidents – and in that they failed spectacularly when an attempt was made on Donald Trump’s life on Saturday. It has been 43 years since the last assassination attempt on a former or present US president, when Ronald Reagan was shot in the lung but survived. Today, American politicians and the public want to know how a would-be assassin was able to crawl onto a rooftop vantage point, armed with a rifle, and let off four shots towards the podium - all in an area that was supposed to have been cleared. Why were warnings from the public apparently ignored or not acted upon?  And why, when a highly charged presidential election is just four months away, did the Secret Service not do a better job of protecting the man many believe will be America’s next president? The investigation that is already under way involves the FBI as well as the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before a committee of the US House of Representatives on 22 July. Those who attended the rally itself were asked to pass through metal detectors to ensure they were not bringing any weapons, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. But the gunman believed to have fired the shots could clearly be seen crawling around with a rifle on top of a nearby building for several minutes, one eyewitness told the BBC. The witness, who called himself Greg, said warnings that he and others gave were not acted upon by police, who he suggested did not know “what was going on” and had poor visibility of the rooftop. The suspected gunman - who has been named by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - also appears to have been caught on camera lining up his shot, in footage obtained by TMZ. One spectator was killed and two others critically injured before the gunman was himself shot dead. Trump was also injured in the ear. State police have said it is “too early” to determine exactly what happened. Trump’s life might have been saved by the fact he ducked after the first shots were fired, said David Dunn, a professor of international politics from the University of Birmingham. In that respect, he “clearly had been well trained by the Secret Service”, Prof Dunn told BBC Radio 5 Live. Before being whisked away in a car by agents, Trump rose again to pump his fist before the crowd. Greg said he was left wondering why agents were not deployed on all the nearby rooftops, and did not intervene to take Trump off stage after he raised the alarm. Former Secret Service agent Charles Marino agreed that there were questions to answer. He told the BBC it would have been among the agents’ tasks to survey the surroundings and note “concerning areas”. Experts who spoke to NBC said events such as political rallies always brought challenges in securing a wide expanse of land. One of them, former Secret Service agent Evy Poumpouras, said there would always be lingering questions: “How do you secure that outer perimeter? How far do you go? And can you cover everything? That’s a problem.” Analysis from BBC Verify suggests that Crooks was able to get a little more than 130m (430ft) from Trump’s position behind the lectern. It was announced late on Saturday that the FBI had assumed the role of lead investigator into the incident, which it describes as an assassination attempt. One of its special agents said at a news conference it was “surprising” that the gunman had been able to open fire before the Secret Service killed him. But when asked if there was a failure of security, he said his team was ""not gonna make that assessment"" while the investigation continued. The Secret Service was not represented at the briefing. An earlier statement confirming the start of the investigation promised more information would be released when available. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said maintaining the security of presidential candidates was one of the departments “most vital priorities”. It is not clear what the attack will mean for the former president's future security arrangements, though an adviser to the Trump campaign said it was clear he needed more protection.  A Secret Service spokesman has denied an ""untrue assertion"" that it was asked by Trump's team for extra resources, but rebuffed this request. In any case, Trump was now likely to receive a security detail comparable to that of a sitting president, former Secret Service agent Joseph LaSorsa told the Reuters news agency. “There will be an intensive review… there's going to be a massive realignment,"" he said. ""This cannot happen."" The Republican National Convention will go ahead as planned on Monday, with a speech from Trump on Thursday, as confirmed by a statement from the party. During the event, Trump will be officially nominated as the Republican candidate for president ahead of November’s election.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87rvg61vrxo,"Frank Gardner, security correspondent, and James FitzGerald,",2024-07-14 15:09:46,,True
355,Man killed during Trump shooting dived on family to protect them,"One man in the audience died while trying to protect his family during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Saturday, authorities say. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief, dove onto family members when the shots rang out. “Corey died a hero,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at a news conference on Sunday. Pennsylvania state police said the other two people shot were 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver. Both were in a stable condition on Sunday. The Pennsylvania governor said that he spoke to Mr Comperatore’s wife and two daughters. “Corey went to church every Sunday,” he said. “Cory loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family.” He said that Mr Comperatore was an avid supporter of Donald Trump and was excited to be at the rally Saturday. “Corey was the very best of us. May his memory be a blessing,” Mr Shapiro said. “Last night was shocking… political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence.” State police said that Mr Comperatore lived in Sarver, about 12 miles (19km) away from the rally site in Butler, outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition to his volunteer firefighting work, he was employed as a project and tooling engineer at a plastics manufacturing company, according to his social media profiles. “He was a good person,” neighbour Matt Achilles told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “We might not have agreed on the same political views, but that didn’t stop him from being a good friend and neighbour.” “He donated money to us when I was in the hospital and he would always come by at our yard sales. He always waved hello when I drove past his house,” Mr Achilles said. Mr Shapiro said also he spoke to the family of one of those injured, but declined to give details about the conversation. A bullet, one of the six to eight shots that were fired at the rally, grazed the ear of former President Trump.

356,How conspiracy theories and hate dominated social feeds after assassination attempt on Trump,"“Staged”. Within minutes of the news breaking about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, that word was trending on X in the United States. It's a word that has become synonymous with conspiracy theories on the fringes of social media, often to cast doubts on an attack or shooting. But in the last 24 hours it has flooded into mainstream online conversation, and posts filled with evidence-free speculation, hate and abuse have racked up millions of views on X. Assassination attempts on US presidents have in the past been magnets for conspiracy - the killing of John F Kennedy in November 1963, most famously. This one was the first to play out in real time, so it’s not surprising that unfounded rumours flourished. But what has stood out is how this frenzy gripped all sides of the political spectrum. It’s not been limited to committed groups of political supporters. Instead, it was actively recommended in users’ “For You” feeds as they tried to make sense of what had happened. And it was often posted by users who have purchased blue ticks, offering their posts greater prominence. As ever, the conspiracy theories sometimes started with legitimate questions and confusion. They centred on alleged security failings, with lots of users understandably asking how this could happen. How did the attacker make it to the roof? Why weren’t they stopped? Into that vacuum rushed a wave of disbelief, speculation and disinformation. “It looks very staged,” read one post on X which racked up a million views. “Nobody in the crowd is running or panicking. Nobody in the crowd heard an actual gun. I don’t trust it. I don’t trust him.” The profile says it’s based on the south-west coast of Ireland. Its since been labelled with a note on X pointing out the shooting was real. Once more footage and testimony from both inside and outside the rally was shared, the panic and fear of those there became all too clear. The conspiracies were compounded by the extraordinary images that have come out since those initial clips. In particular, a widely-praised photograph taken by the Associated Press chief photographer in Washington, Evan Vucci, that shows Trump, fist raised, blood on his face and ear, with the US flag in the background. One US-based YouTube account said the picture was just “too damn perfect” and described how they got “the flag positioned perfect and everything”. The post on X reached almost one million views - but was later deleted by the person who shared it. It’s important to correct yourself if you’re wrong, they said in a separate post. Others pointed out that, as the shots were fired, Trump raises his hand on stage. They used this to suggest the event was set up when there’s no evidence to suggest that. “Staged to get sympathy? You can’t trust these people with anything and no, I’m not going to pray for him,” a different US-based commentator wrote. Lots of the most viral posts, including this, came from left-leaning users who regularly share their anti-Trump views. They already had hundreds of thousands of followers before today - and therefore a significant reach. What unfolded on X was straight out of the pages of the conspiracy theory playbook, honed on social media by committed activists who deny the reality of almost everything, including the Covid pandemic, wars, mass shootings and terror attacks. One post from a US-based account with a track record of sharing unfounded claims like this wrote: “This is price you pay when you take down the elite satanic paedophiles.” They were alluding to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which suggests Trump is waging a secret war against a deep state - a shadowy coalition of security and intelligence services, hidden from plain sight, looking to thwart his every move. Without any evidence to support the idea, they then went on to suggest the “order” for the assassination “likely came from the CIA” and accused Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence of being involved. There is no evidence to support any of that - but the post has been seen 4.7 million times. It’s a familiar pattern, but the real change here is how this kind of lingo is being widely used by the average social media users. That’s not only people who don’t like Trump suggesting this was staged, but also ones who support him alleging this is part of a sprawling conspiracy theory. Elected politicians have also got involved. Congressman Mike Collins, a Republican in Georgia, posted that “Joe Biden sent the orders”. He referenced a comment President Biden had made earlier in the week about putting “Trump in a bullseye”,  referring to their election battle. There are legitimate questions being asked about some of the language used to describe Trump by other politicians and the media, as well as online, which some of Trump’s supporters argue has inflamed tensions and contributed to this assassination attempt. But to suggest this was ordered by President Biden is an entirely different proposition all together. Collins’ post has more than 6 million views on X - but has since been labelled with a community note, which says there is no evidence Mr Biden was involved in any way. It added that his “bullseye” remark has been taken out of context. Incorrect attempts to identify the shooter fed into the various evidence-free narratives. Before the FBI named the gunman as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot and killed by the Secret Service, other people’s reputations were being ruined. Like football commentator Marco Violi, who posted on Instagram in the middle of the night from Italy to say he’d seen the totally false claims he was a member of Antifa - a loose affiliation of mostly far-left activists - and behind the attack. Those untrue allegations had millions of views on X by the time he attempted to set the record straight on Instagram. On X, political activists and supporters quickly hunkered down in their own echo chambers, reading posts that were recommended by the site’s algorithm and confirmed what they already thought. The rest of us scrambled to avoid this deep pit of conspiracy and speculation. This was a test for Elon Musk’s new Twitter - and it’s hard to say the site passed with flying colours. The other social media sites haven’t been inundated in the same way, perhaps because of their target audience and X’s reputation as a home of political discourse. X has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment. What happened at the Trump Rally?

358,"First panic, then fury - what I witnessed at Trump rally","Sometimes sounds can be deceptive. A car backfiring can make you jump; a firework can make you flinch; but as soon as we heard the gunfire at the Butler Farm showgrounds shortly after 6pm on Saturday evening, we all knew straight away that these were gunshots, and there were lots of them. Donald Trump was mid-way through a sentence as the shots rang out. He grabbed his ear before dropping to the ground and being smothered by Secret Service agents. We didn’t know it at the time, but the gunman was perhaps 150m away from where we stood, lying flat on the roof of a shed and firing at least six rounds using an AR-15 rifle at the former president and terrifed spectators. I was about to go on air, with radio colleagues from the BBC World Service waiting on the end of a line. Instead all three of us in my team - me, producer Iona Hampson and cameraman Sam Beattie - went to the ground, using our car as some kind of shelter, the only shelter we had. We had no idea where the shooting was coming from; how many shooters there were; and how long it would go on for. Frankly it was terrifying. As we lay on the ground, Sam turned on his camera and I tried to give my first impressions of what was happening. In that moment, we had no more concrete information than that about six minutes into Donald Trump’s speech, the shooting had begun.  As I listened I could hear screams from the crowd but I could no longer hear the former president speaking. Was he hit, was he dead? All these thoughts flash through your mind. When we felt the shooting was over, Iona picked me up off the ground and we went live on television as shocked members of the crowd poured out of the exits. The range of emotions we encountered was immense, as Iona persuaded terrified spectators to come and talk to me live on television. Many were understandably frightened; many were dazed and bewildered; some were angry, very angry. One witness, a man named Greg, said he had seen the gunman “bear-crawling” onto the roof of the shed minutes before the chaos began and had been frantically trying to point him out to police and the Secret Service. Another man – and I can understand this – was furious that we were broadcasting; he put himself between me and Sam yelling at me to stop. I laid my hand as gently as I could on his arm and explained to him while we were on air that it was important people knew what had just happened; the public, I said, had to know. Eventually, as I pleaded with him, he relented – still unhappy and still fuming, rightly so, at what he’d just experienced.  Others expressed their anger in more political ways. One man approached me and simply said: “They shot first. This is [expletive] war.” Another just yelled “civil war” as he passed behind me. And a few minutes later a huge electronic billboard appeared on the side of a truck – Donald Trump’s face framed in a target – the words simply read “Democrats attempted assassination - President Trump”. It sent a shiver right up my spine – and the horror of the potential consequences of this act started to sink in. But amid the fear and anger, there was profound sorrow. People who were loyal Trump supporters, committed gun owners, wondered out loud to me about the way America was going. It was as if they could no longer recognise the country they lived in – as if everything had become strange and foreign. Devin, a local farmer, was there with his son Kolbie. It was their first ever political rally – Kolbie, just 14, still not old enough to vote. But Kolbie’s first experience of the rawness of democracy was to see two wounded people loaded onto stretchers and rushed off to ambulances. It’s hard not to believe that those images of muzzle flashes he witnessed from the Secret Service snipers who took down the gunman won’t stay with him for the rest of his life.  I’ve covered at least half a dozen shootings in my ten years as a correspondent in the US – but always the immediate aftermath – never have I been present until now when someone actually pulled the trigger. I don’t want to experience it again, and in this gun-loving country, even those committed to their handguns and rifles in this rural part of Western Pennsylvania seemed sickened and worried about the randomness of the violence they witnessed in late-afternoon sunshine as they wondered whether their political hero was still alive. But what happened in Butler goes much wider than arguments over gun control. America has been spiralling towards this moment for years – a political culture that is not just adversarial but downright poisonous. People here – or should I say some people here – find it easy to hate their political opponents – it’s visceral; it’s become part of the nation’s DNA to hate. And it’s not just political. You can see it in the divisions between the coasts and the centre. Between the north and the south; between the cities and rural America – everything being defined in terms of not being something or someone else. Moments in history can only really be judged in retrospect. But I’ll take a guess that last night will go down as one of those moments. The question for the leaders of public opinion in this country is what will they now choose to do – to inflame or to calm. To further divide or to reunite. As an outsider but someone who truly loves this nation, I’m not hopeful.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnl0xq0j9ewo,"Gary O'Donoghue,",2024-07-14 17:09:46,,True
361,Melania Trump speaks out: 'Ascend above the hate',"Melania Trump released a statement in the hours after a gunman attempted to shoot and kill her husband, calling on Americans to repair political divisions and focus on love.  ""Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy and political games are inferior to love,"" she said.   In her message, she referred to the man behind the assassination attempt Saturday as a ""monster"" and denounced the ""violent"" attack on Donald Trump's life. Mrs Trump's statement breaks a relatively long streak of silence, having mostly stayed off the campaign trail during the former president's re-election effort and away from cameras amid his legal battles.  The former first lady's quiet resignation to her personal life, however, ended at least temporarily, with the statement Sunday. ""When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life were on the brink of devastating change,"" Mrs Trump said.  ""I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.""  Mrs Trump also paid tribute to the other victims of the attack.  ""To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy,"" she said.  Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident, allegedly took aim Saturday evening at Donald Trump with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire. The Republican presidential canidate's ear was grazed, one person was killed, and two others injured, police have said.  During the attack, Crooks was shot and killed by authorities.  In her message, Mrs Trump sought to remind readers of her husband's humanity, the Trump family's humanity - and America's humanity.  ""Let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here in this earthly realm.""  Mrs Trump recently made news headlines when she was not listed as a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin this week.  She did, however, speak at the conventions in 2016 and 2020, underscoring possibly  how much she has chosen to avoid the limelight recently.  But the gravity of the moment forced her back into the spotlight this weekend. ""This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,"" she said.  ""We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first and love transcends.""",2024-07-14 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19kw8jzvvmo,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-14 17:09:47,,True
373,What are the big security threats coming down the track?,"On the face of it, this past week’s Nato summit in Washington has ticked the boxes. The alliance can show it is bigger and stronger than ever, its military support for Ukraine appears undiminished and it has just sent a robust message to China to stop secretly supporting Russia’s war on Kyiv. Sir Keir Starmer’s new government has had a chance to position itself as a linchpin in the transatlantic alliance at a time when political uncertainty hovers over the White House and much of Europe. Back home in Britain, the priorities for this new government are pressing: the economy, housing, immigration, the NHS, to name but a few.  Yet unwanted threats and scenarios can often have a habit of turning up and upsetting the best laid plans. So what could be coming down the track during the life of this new UK government?  No surprises here, this one is on everybody’s radar. But that does not make it any less dangerous, for Lebanon, Israel and the entire Middle East. ""The possibility of a large-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon this summer should be at the top of the new government’s geopolitical risk register.""  That’s according to Professor Malcolm Chalmers, the Deputy Director-General of the Whitehall think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  With the conflict continuing in Gaza and the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping continuing, Prof Chalmers believes ""we could be entering a period of sustained multi-front warfare in the region, for which neither Israel nor its Western partners will be prepared."" Ever since the Hamas-led raid into southern Israel on 7 October last year, there have been fears that Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza could escalate across borders into a full-scale regional war. Israel’s troubled northern border with Lebanon is where such a war is most at risk of igniting.  The daily exchange of fire across this border, between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia, have already resulted in hundreds killed, mostly in Lebanon.  More than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods in the north and an even greater number of people on the Lebanese side.  Domestic pressure is mounting for the Israeli government to ""deal with"" Hezbollah by pushing its forces north of Lebanon’s Litani River, from where they would have less chance of sending rockets into Israel. ""We don’t want to go to war,"" says Lt Col Nadav Shoshani of the IDF, ""but I don’t think any country could accept 60,000 of its citizens displaced. The situation has to end. We would like it to be a diplomatic solution, but Israeli patience is wearing thin.""  There are strong reasons for both sides not to go to war. Lebanon’s economy is already fragile. It has barely recovered from the 2006 war with Israel and a renewed full-scale conflict would have a devastating impact on the country’s infrastructure and its people. Hezbollah, for its part, would likely respond to a major Israeli attack and invasion with a massive and sustained missile, drone and rocket barrage that could potentially overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome air defences.  Nowhere in Israel is beyond its reach. At this point, the US Navy, positioned offshore, could well join in on Israel’s side. Which then begs the question of what Iran would do.  It too has a sizeable arsenal of ballistic missiles as well as a network of proxy militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria that could be mobilised to intensify their attacks on Israel. One way to take the heat out of the tension on the Israel-Lebanon border would be for the conflict in Gaza to come to an end. But after nine months and a horrific death toll, a lasting peace has yet to be achieved. The Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to contain and monitor Iran’s nuclear programme, was the crowning foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration in 2015.  But it has long since fallen apart.  One year after President Trump unilaterally withdrew from it, Iran stopped abiding by its rules.  Buried deep beneath gigantic mountains, ostensibly beyond the reach of even the most powerful of bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s nuclear centrifuges have been spinning frantically, enriching uranium to well beyond the 20% needed for peaceful civil purposes. (A nuclear bomb requires highly enriched uranium.) Officially, Iran insists its nuclear programme remains entirely peaceful, that it is purely for generating energy.  But Israeli and Western experts have voiced fears that Iran has a clandestine programme to reach what is known as ""breakout capability"": achieving a position where it has the capacity to build a nuclear bomb, but does not necessarily do so. It will not have escaped Iran’s notice that North Korea, an isolated, global pariah, has been steadily amassing an arsenal of nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them, constituting a major deterrent to any would-be attacker. If Iran gets the Bomb, then it is almost inevitable that Saudi Arabia, its regional rival, would also go after acquiring it. So would Turkey and so would Egypt.  And suddenly there is a nuclear arms race all across the Middle East. This depends on what you define as ""winning"".  At its maximalist, it means Russian forces overwhelming Ukraine’s defences and seizing the rest of the country including the capital Kyiv, replacing the pro-West government of President Volodymyr Zelensky with a puppet regime appointed by Moscow.  That, of course, was the original plan behind the full-scale Russian invasion of February 2022, a plan which failed spectacularly. This scenario is currently thought unlikely.  But Russia does not need to conquer the whole of Ukraine to be able to declare some kind of ""victory"", something that it can present to its population to justify the astronomically high casualties it is sustaining in this war. Russia already occupies around 18% of Ukraine and, in the east, its forces are slowly gaining ground.  Although more Western weapons are on their way, Ukraine is critically short of manpower. Its troops, fighting bravely, often heavily outnumbered and outgunned, are exhausted.  Russian commanders, who seem to care little for the lives of their men, have mass on their side. Russia’s entire economy has been placed on a war footing, with close to 40% of the state budget now devoted to defence. President Vladimir Putin, whose recent ""conditions for peace talks"" equated to total capitulation by Ukraine, believes he has time on his side. He knows there is a high chance that his old friend Donald Trump will be back in the White House within months and that Western support for Ukraine will start to crumble. Russia needs only to hang on to the territory it has already seized, and to deny Ukraine the chance of joining Nato and the EU, to declare a partial victory in the war it has portrayed as a fight for Russian survival. Again, there are plenty of warnings that this one might be coming.  China’s President Xi Jinping and his officials have stated on numerous occasions that the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan must be ""returned to the Motherland"", by force if necessary. Taiwan does not want to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing. But China considers Taiwan a renegade province and it wants to see it ""reunited"" well before the centenary of the founding of the CCP in 2049. The US has adopted a position of what it calls ""strategic ambiguity"" over Taiwan.  It is legally bound to help defend Taiwan, but Washington prefers to keep China guessing as to whether that means sending US forces to fight off a Chinese invasion. China would almost certainly prefer not to invade Taiwan.  It would be hugely costly, in both blood and treasure. Ideally, Beijing would like Taiwan to give up on its dreams of full independence and volunteer to be ruled by the mainland.  But as that currently looks unlikely – the Taiwanese have watched with horror the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong – Beijing has another option up its sleeve.  If and when it decides to move on Taiwan, it is likely to try to seal it off from the outside world, making life unbearable for its citizens, but with the minimum of bloodshed so as to avoid provoking a war with the US. Does Taiwan matter? It does.  This is about more than lofty principles of defending a democratic ally on the other side of the world.  Taiwan produces more than 90% of the world’s top-end microchips, the miniscule bits of tech that power almost everything that runs our modern-day lives. A US-China war over Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy that would dwarf the war in Ukraine. Not exactly, but there are some moderating factors here. For China, trade is all-important. Beijing’s ambitious plans to squeeze the US Navy out of the western Pacific and dominate the entire region may well be tempered by its reluctance to trigger damaging sanctions and a global trade war. In Ukraine, President Putin may be making slow, incremental territorial gains but this comes at a horrendous cost in casualties.  When the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s, it suffered around 15,000 killed over a decade, triggering protests at home and hastening the demise of the Soviet Union.  In Ukraine, in just one quarter of that time, Russia has suffered many multiples of that death toll. To date, protest has been limited - the Kremlin largely controls what news Russians see - but the longer this war goes on, the greater the risk that the Russian public will eventually baulk at the mounting number of their fellow citizens getting killed. In Europe, where worries abound over a future Trump presidency withdrawing its historic protection, a new UK-led security pact is being prepared.  As the US presidential election in November draws closer, plans are accelerating to try to  mitigate any possible downsides to the continent’s security.",2024-07-14 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g4pjj2gwo,"Frank Gardner,",2024-07-14 05:09:48,,True
375,Spray of bullets shatters nation's illusion of security,"A spray of bullets may have only grazed Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, but they killed one rally attendee and critically wounded two others. They have also torn through the 2024 presidential campaign, damaging the social and cultural fabric of the nation. The illusion of security and safety in American politics – built over decades - has been dramatically shattered. Trump received only minor injuries but it was close - a photograph by Doug Mills of the New York Times appears to show the streak of a bullet cutting through the air near the former president’s head. Not since Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinkley Jr in 1981 has there been such a dramatic act of violence directed against a president - or presidential candidate. It harkens back to a darker time in US history, more than a half-century ago, when two Kennedy brothers – one a president and one a presidential candidate - were felled by assassin bullets. Civil rights leaders such as Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X all also lost their lives in political violence. Like today, the 1960s were marred by intense political polarisation and dysfunction, when a firearm and an individual willing to use it could change the course of history. It is difficult to predict the impact Saturday’s events will have on America - and its political discourse. Already, there have been some bipartisan calls for a cooling of rhetoric and national unity. Within hours of the incident, President Joe Biden – Trump’s likely opponent in November – appeared before cameras in Delaware to make a statement to the press. “There is no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick,” he said. “We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.” The president later spoke by phone with the former president. He cut short his weekend at the beach and is returning to the White House late Saturday evening. But the violence has also quickly filtered into the bare-knuckle partisan trench-warfare that has characterised American politics in recent decades. Some Republican politicians have laid the blame for the attack on Democrats who have employed dire rhetoric about the threat they say the former president poses to American democracy.  “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Ohio Senator JD Vance, who is reportedly on the shortlist to be Trump’s vice-presidential pick, posted on social media. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s assassination attempt.” Chris LaCivita, the Trump campaign manager, said that “leftist activists, Democratic donors and even Joe Biden” need to be held accountable at the ballot box in November for “disgusting remarks” that in his view led to Saturday’s attack. Democrats may object, but many on the left used similar language to describe the culpability of right-wing rhetoric in the months before the 2011 near-fatal shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Arizona. The Pennsylvania violence will undoubtedly cast a long shadow over the Republican convention, which begins on Monday. Security protocols will be tightened, and the protests – and counter-protests – near the site could be accompanied by a new sense of foreboding. Meanwhile, an even brighter national spotlight will shine on the party’s nominee when he takes the stage on Thursday night. Images of the former president, bloodied, with an upraised fist are sure to become a rallying point in Milwaukee. The Republican Party was already planning to make strength and rugged masculinity a central theme, and Saturday’s incident will give that a jolt of new energy. “This is the fighter America needs!” Eric Trump wrote on social media, accompanied by a photograph of his father after the shooting. The US Secret Service will also face intense scrutiny for its handling of security at the Trump rally. An individual with a high-powered rifle was able to come within firing distance of a major presidential candidate.  Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is promising that his chamber will conduct a full inquiry. Those investigations will take time.  But for now, one thing is clear: in a year of uncharted electoral waters, America’s politics have taken a new, deadly turn.",2024-07-14 23:09:50,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vdq5wy4kwo,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-14 04:09:50,,True
376,Thomas Matthew Crooks: What we know about the Trump attacker,"The small Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park in Pennsylvania is reeling after the FBI named a young local man, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as the person who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign rally and shocked the nation. Investigators believe that Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire at the former president while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania, leaving one audience member dead and two others critically wounded.  The 20-year-old kitchen worker was shot dead at the scene by a Secret Service sniper, officials said.  In his quiet and well-to-do hometown, however, neighbours are in shock, seemingly unable to grasp how a quiet young man is now accused in the shooting. The FBI, for its part, has said only that Crooks was the ""subject involved in the assassination attempt on the former president and that an active investigation was under way. Thomas Crooks had not been carrying ID, so investigators used DNA to identify him, the FBI said. He was from Bethel Park in Pennsylvania, about 70km (43 miles) from the site of the attempted assassination, and graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School with a $500 prize for maths and science, according to a local newspaper.  Crooks worked in a local nursing home kitchen just a short drive away from his home, the BBC understands. State voter records show that he was a registered Republican, according to US media. He is also reported to have donated $15 to liberal campaign group ActBlue in 2021. According to US media reports, Crooks was wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a YouTube channel known for its guns and demolition content. The channel has millions of subscribers featuring videos on different guns and explosive devices. Law enforcement officials believe the weapon used to shoot at Donald Trump was purchased by Crook's father, the Associated Press news agency reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity, two officers told AP that Crooks' father bought a weapon at least six months ago.  The day after the shooting, law enforcement sources also told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that suspicious devices were found in Crooks' vehicle. According to CBS, the suspect had a piece of commercially available equipment that appeared capable of initiating the devices.  Bomb technicians were called to the scene to secure and investigate the devices.  Having established Crooks's identity, police and agencies are investigating his motive. ""We do not currently have an identified motive,"" said Kevin Rojek, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, at a briefing on Saturday night. The inquiry into what took place could last for months and investigators would work ""tirelessly"" to identify what Crooks' motive was, Mr Rojek said. Speaking to CNN, Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but would “wait until I talk to law enforcement” before speaking about his son.  Police sealed off the road to the house where Crooks lived with his parents, CBS News reports. A neighbour told CBS that officers evacuated her in the middle of the night with no warning. Bethel Park Police said there was a bomb investigation surrounding Crooks's home. Access to the area remains tightly controlled with police vehicles blocking the roads. Only residents have been allowed in or out.  Law enforcement sources told CBS that they believe some degree of planning ahead of the shooting.  How much time was spent in that planning, however, remains the subject of an ongoing investigation.  Police believe he acted alone, but are continuing to investigate whether he was accompanied to the rally.  So far, a confusing - and at times conflicting - picture has emerged of who Crooks was as a person.  Speaking to local news outlet KDKA, some young locals who went to school with him described him as a loner, who was frequently bullied and sometimes wore ""hunting outfits to school"".  Another former classmate of his, Summer Barkley, cast him differently, telling the BBC that he was ""always getting good grades on tests"" and was ""very passionate about history"".  ""Anything on government and history he seemed to know about,"" he said. ""But it was nothing out of the ordinary....he was always nice.""  Others simply remembered him as quiet.  ""He was there but I can't think of anyone who knew him well,"" one former classmate, who asked to remain nameless, told the BBC. ""He's just not a guy I really think about. But he seemed fine. Jameson Myers, a former member of the Bethel Park High School varsity rifle team who graduated alongside Crooks in 2022, told CBS that he did not make the team.  ""He did not even make the junior varsity team after trying out,"" Mr Myers added. ""He never returned to try-outs for the remainder of high school.""  Mr Myers remembers Crooks as seemingly a ""normal boy"" who was ""not particularly popular but never got picked on or anything.""  “He was a nice kid who never talked poorly of anyone and I never have thought him capable of anything I’ve seen him do in the last few days.”  A shooting club in the Pittsburgh area, the Clairton Sportmen's Club, later confirmed that Crooks was a member, although club president Bill Sellitto did not provide any more details.  Other community members said simply that they were shocked that the alleged perpetrator of the shooting could have come from the quiet, green streets of Bethel Park.  Among them was Jason Mackey, a 27-year-old local man who lives near the Crooks residence and worked at his school while he was a student.  While Mr Mackey said that he did not know Crooks personally, he is still reeling from a sense of disbelief.  ""It's just shocking. You wouldn't think an event of this magnitude would come right out of your backyard,"" he said. ""It's just a crazy situation."" One person was killed and two others were injured in the shooting.  All three victims are adult men and were audience members, CBS News reports.  At a news conference on Sunday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro identified the deceased victim at Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief who was killed when he ""dived on his family"" to protect them. He said that Comperatore ""died a hero"".  A GoFundMe page, organised by the Trump campaign's national finance director Meredith O'Rourke, was set up in the hours after the attack with donations going to the families of the injured. It has so far raised more than $340,000 (£267,000). In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear"" and said he felt the bullet ""ripping through the skin"". Blood was visible on Trump's ear and face as protection officers rushed him away. Trump is ""doing well"" and is grateful to law enforcement officers, according to a statement published on the Republican National Committee (RNC) website. One witness told the BBC that he had seen a man – believed to be Crooks - with a rifle on the roof of a building before Trump was shot.  Video footage obtained by TMZ shows the moment the shooting began. The assailant opened fire with “an AR-style rifle”, CBS News reports.  Law enforcement sources also told CBS that he was reported by a bystander and identified as a suspicious person by police, but that officers lost track of him before the shooting began.  However, the FBI says it did not immediately know what type of firearm was used or how many shots were fired. A Secret Service sniper returned fire and killed the gunman, the agency said. Footage later shows armed officers approaching a body on the roof of the building.",2024-07-14 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gw58wv4e9o,"Bernd Debusmann, Tom Bateman and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-14 19:09:51,,True
381,Secret Service faces questions after Trump assassination attempt,"The Secret Service is facing questions after former US President Donald Trump was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania.  Trump, who is now ""doing well"", says he was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds at a fairground in Butler.   One bystander was killed in the shooting and two others were critically injured, according to a Secret Service spokesman.  The Director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before the US House of Representatives on 22 July by the Oversight Committee - the main investigative board of the US House of Representatives.  At a news conference on Sunday, FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said it was ""surprising"" that the shooter, who has been named as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to open fire before the Secret Service killed him.  An investigation into the attempted assassination, which is already under way, involves the FBI, the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. ""Americans demand answers about the assassination attempt of President Trump,"" the Oversight Committee said in a statement on social media. Trump was quickly bundled off stage and into a waiting vehicle after shots were fired just a few minutes into his speech at 18:11 local time on Saturday.  Blood could be seen near the former president's ear as he raised his fist to the crowd.  In a post to his Truth Social network, Trump said a bullet pierced the ""upper part"" of his right ear.  ""I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,"" Trump wrote.  ""Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening."" The FBI said it is treating the incident as an assassination attempt on Trump and it is an ""active and ongoing investigation"". The suspect was shot dead at the scene by a US Secret Service sniper, said the agency's spokesperson, Anthony Guglielmi.  He added that the one bystander killed in the shooting, and the two others critically injured, were all male. Their identities have not been released.  Law enforcement sources told CBS News that Crooks had been armed with ""an AR-style rifle"" and had fired from a building a few hundred metres from the venue.  Special Agent Kevin Rojek said Crooks had not been carrying ID and that investigators used DNA to identify him. They have yet to identify a motive for the assassination attempt, he added. State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican, according to US media reports.  He is also reported to have donated $15 to a liberal campaign group in 2021. A senior adviser to Donald Trump's campaign said there are questions about how prepared the Secret Service was. Speaking to the BBC World Service, Stephen Moore called it a ""scary day"". ""Certainly Trump needs more protection - there’s a lot of inquiry now about whether the Secret Service was totally prepared,"" Mr Moore said.  However, Mr Guglielmi says there is an ""untrue assertion"" circulating that someone on Trump's security team had requested extra security ""resources"" and that request was ""rebuffed"". ""This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources and technology and capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo,"" Mr Guglielmi said.  Trump had just started addressing his supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania - a crucial swing state in November's election - when the shots started.  Multiple bangs rang out as Trump spoke about his successor, President Joe Biden, and his administration.  Several supporters holding placards and standing behind Trump ducked as the shots were heard.  Bystanders who spoke to the BBC suggested the gunshots may have come from a one-storey building to the right of the stage where Trump was speaking. One witness - Greg - told the BBC that he had spotted a suspicious-looking person ""bear crawling"" on the roof of the building about five minutes after Trump took to the stage. He said he pointed the person out to police.  ""He had a rifle, we could clearly see him with a rifle,"" he said. ""We’re pointing at him, the police are down there running around on the ground – we’re like ‘hey man there’s a guy on the roof with a rifle’ and the police did not know what was going on."" Tim - who was also at the rally - told the BBC that he had heard a ""barrage"" of shots.  ""There was a spray which we initially thought was a fire hose, and then the speaker on the right-hand side started coming down,"" he said.  ""Something must have hit the hydraulic lines [which caused it to fall]. We saw President Trump go to the ground and everyone started dropping to the ground because it was chaos."" Warren and Debbie were at the venue and told the BBC they heard at least four gunshots. They said they both got on the ground as Secret Service agents came through the crowd, shouting for the attendees to get down. People remained calm, they said. ""We couldn't believe it was happening,"" Warren said. Debbie said a little girl beside them was crying that she didn't want to die and saying ""how is this happening to us?"" ""That broke my heart,"" Debbie said. Republican Congressman Ronnie Jackson told the BBC that his nephew was injured in the shooting. He sustained a minor wound to his neck and was treated at the scene, Mr Jackson said in a statement.  Speaking from his home state of Delaware, President Biden deplored the attack, calling it ""sick"".  ""There's no place in America for this kind of violence,"" he said. ""Everybody must condemn it."" The White House later said President Biden had spoken with Trump before returning to Washington DC.  Trump remains locked in a tight contest with President Biden - the presumptive Democratic nominee - in a re-match of the 2020 election.  Politicians of both parties joined Mr Biden in condemning the apparent attack.  Former President Barack Obama said there ""is absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy"" and that he was ""relieved that former President Trump wasn’t seriously hurt"".  Trump's former vice-president Mike Pence said he and his wife were praying for his former ally, adding that he urged ""every American to join us"".  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement: “My thoughts and prayers are with former President Trump. I am thankful for the decisive law enforcement response. America is a democracy. Political violence of any kind is never acceptable.” UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer led international condemnation of the shooting, saying he was ""appalled by the shocking scenes at President Trump's rally"".  ""Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack,"" he said in a statement. Trump is still set to accept his party's nomination for president at the convention in Milwaukee on Monday, his campaign managers said. Some had speculated that he had been set to reveal his running mate at the Butler rally. Some Republicans were quick to blame President Biden over the shooting, accusing him of stoking fears about Trump's potential return to office.  Senator JD Vance, who is thought to be on the shortlist to become Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, said the rhetoric from the Biden campaign had led directly to this incident. Mike Collins - a Republican congressman - accused the president of “inciting an assassination”. Meanwhile James Comer, the chair of the powerful House oversight committee, said he would summon the director of the Secret Service before his panel.

386,'An annihilation - Alcaraz always had the answers',"This video can not be played Highlights: Alcaraz beats Djokovic in straight sets to retain Wimbledon title Did anyone expect that? Carlos Alcaraz's victory over Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final may not have been a huge surprise, but the way it played out certainly was. In the build-up, there was talk of a repeat of last year's final - an almighty tussle that went the full five sets. And when the first game of the match lasted 14 minutes, with Djokovic eventually surrendering his serve, many felt it would be more of the same. But Alcaraz flipped the script, racing through the first two sets, taking advantage of an off-colour Djokovic and never allowing the 24-time major champion to raise his level as he won 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-4). ""It was an annihilation. Alcaraz was phenomenal,"" former British number one Tim Henman said on BBC TV. ""The tone was set in the first game. Alcaraz was relentless and gave Djokovic nothing to get his teeth stuck into. ""Alcaraz always had the answers. The first set wasn't even close. When he needed it most in the tie-break, it was like Djokovic blinked."" Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said it was ""a perfect performance"", describing it as a ""breathtaking type of tennis on the biggest stage there is"". At 21, Alcaraz is a four-time major champion, and has won the French Open and Wimbledon in the space of five weeks. ""Alcaraz will carry our sport a long way,"" said Nick Kyrgios - runner-up at Wimbledon in 2022. ""The biggest enemy he'll have is his body. How healthy can he stay? ""I think he'll have upwards of 15 Slams, for sure."" Alcaraz crushes Djokovic to retain Wimbledon title 'Best day of my life' - Hewett wins singles and doubles 'Nobody will believe I won Wimbledon - I still can't' The only sign of nerves Alcaraz showed was when he dropped three championship points at 5-4 in the third set. But an otherwise flawless performance underscored why the Spaniard became only the eighth player to win the first four Grand Slam men's singles finals of his career. He is just the second in the Open Era, which began in 1968, to achieve the feat after Roger Federer, who won the first seven Slam finals he contested. Alcaraz is the ninth man in the Open Era to retain his Wimbledon title and the sixth to triumph at the French Open and All England Club in the same year. At 21 years and 70 days, he is the youngest player in the Open Era to do the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in the same calendar year. The Spaniard is also the third-youngest player in the Open Era to retain his Wimbledon title, following Boris Becker (18 years, 227 days) and Bjorn Borg (21 years, 26 days). Djokovic, arguably the greatest ever when it comes to performing under pressure, was quick to praise the Spaniard's performance. ""Overall the way I felt on the court today against him, I was inferior,"" said Djokovic. ""That's it. He was a better player. He played every single shot better than I did. I don't think I could have done much more. He was playing with a lot of variety. He really outplayed me."" Alcaraz, for his part, remains focused on the future. ""At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys. That's my main goal,"" he said. ""That's my dream right now. It doesn't matter if I already won four Grand Slams at the age of 21. ""If I'm not keeping going, all these tournaments for me, it doesn't matter."" Allow Instagram content?

Djokovic has only lost three of his 10 Wimbledon finals - and two of those have been to Alcaraz. He has won a major on all three surfaces and, perhaps most ominously for his rivals, the Slams seem to bring out his most tenacious qualities. He has an astonishing 12-1 record in fifth sets, having not lost one since the 2022 Australian Open when he was just starting to break through, and he came back from two sets to one down at both Wimbledon and Roland Garros. His big-hitting is suited to hard courts, he has the movement for the clay and the touch for grass-court success. However, he has struggled with injury in recent years. The Spaniard missed the end-of-season 2022 ATP Finals because of an abdominal problem and the Australian Open a few months later with a hamstring issue. ""The one enemy in Alcaraz's career so far has been injuries,"" said Kyrgios. ""This is only his eighth event this year, so if he's able to get on top of that and find what works for his body, nothing is going to be able to stop him in my eyes."" With attention now turning to the Olympics, on the Paris clay where Alcaraz won his third Slam, many will be wondering who will challenge him for the title. With Djokovic in the latter part of his career, eyes shift to younger players, with Henman citing Italy's Jannik Sinner, Denmark's Holger Rune and American Ben Shelton as having the potential to challenge Alcaraz. ""There's plenty who are going to want to stand up - Jannik Sinner is the world number one right now and they have a great rivalry ahead of them,"" Henman said. ""But for me Alcaraz's variety, the strings to his bow that he's able to utilise on every surface, is a pleasure to watch."" Alcaraz said: ""I think it is good for tennis to have new faces winning the big things and fighting for the big tournaments. ""I think it's great for the sport and I think for the players as well.""",2024-07-14 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c51y2vn643yo,Amy Lofthouse,2024-07-14 20:09:52,,True
385,'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph,"This video can not be played All the angles of Yamal's 'unbelievable goal' Breaking Pele's 66-year-old record and achieving things Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could only have dreamed of at his age. It is fair to say Lamine Yamal has shaken up the game of football in the past year - and he reached the pinnacle on Sunday as he became the youngest player to win a European Championship or World Cup - at the age of 17 years and one day. The Barcelona winger set up Nico Williams' opener in their 2-1 Euro 2024 final win over England - and forced Jordan Pickford into two fine saves. Nobody was involved in more Euro 2024 goals than Yamal - with one goal and four assists. Nobody has set up more goals in a single European Championship since records began in 1980. And nobody has ever been directly involved in goals in a quarter-final, semi-final and final before Yamal achieved the feat. Unsurprisingly, he was named the tournament's Young Player of the Tournament. ""I am very happy, this is a dream,"" said Yamal. ""I'm looking forward to returning to Spain and celebrating with all the fans. It's the best birthday present ever."" Former England defender Rio Ferdinand said the teenager was a ""sensation"" and an ""elite player"".  ""He was a star before this tournament, but he's a superstar now,"" he added. In the last few weeks Yamal became the youngest person to play at the Euros, to assist a goal at the Euros and to score a goal at the Euros. It is not just potential, he is already one of the most exciting players in the world. Former Spain midfielder Juan Mata, working on BBC One, said: ""I was having dinner yesterday with [Barcelona boss] Xavi and he told me he hasn't seen a player of this quality."" That is the Xavi who played alongside the legendary Messi at Barcelona. ""I don't like to make comparisons between players or compare them with Messi, but I think the sky is the limit for this kid,"" added Mata. So what has Barcelona winger Yamal, who turned 17 on Saturday, achieved so far in his career - and why is it so special? 'A superstar is born' - Yamal's history making moment of 'genius' 'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 England Before turning 17, Yamal had played 51 times for Barcelona, scoring seven goals and setting up another seven. For Spain he now has 14 appearances, three goals and seven assists. By comparison, neither Argentina's Messi nor Portugal's Ronaldo - the two greatest players of this generation - had played a single first-team game for club or country when they were 16.  And when we look at the players expected to replace Messi and Ronaldo as Ballon d'Or rivals in the future - France's Kylian Mbappe and Norway's Erling Haaland - their stats at this age cannot compare to Yamal either. Mbappe had played four games for Monaco, making one assist before turning 17, while Haaland had played 23 times in Norway for second-tier Bryne and top-flight Molde, scoring once. Even one of the most famous players to make their breakthrough at 16, Wayne Rooney, had only played 10 times for Everton and scored three goals before reaching 17. Not all of Yamal's appearances have come aged 16... because he was even younger when he made his Barcelona debut.  At 15 years and 290 days he became Barcelona's youngest player in the La Liga era when he replaced Gavi with six minutes to go in a 4-0 win over Real Betis on 29 April 2023. On 20 August, aged 16 years and 38 days, he became the youngest player since 1939 to start a La Liga game when he lined up in a 2-0 win over Cadiz. Just a week later he became the youngest player to assist a La Liga goal in the 21st century when he crossed for Gavi to head in during a 4-3 win at Villarreal. He became the youngest player to start a game in the Champions League, at 16 and 83 days, in a 1-0 win at Porto on 4 October. Four days later he became the youngest goalscorer in La Liga history when he netted in the first half of a 2-2 draw at Granada. He became the youngest player to play in El Clasico, the youngest to set up a Champions League goal, aged 16 years and 153 days at Antwerp, and the youngest player and scorer in the Spanish Super Cup. Yamal also became the youngest player to score in the Spanish Cup this century, the youngest to score twice in a La Liga game, the youngest player in a Champions League knockout game and then a quarter-final. Unsurprisingly he is the youngest player to make 50 appearances for Barcelona and the youngest to play 10 Champions League games. Even Yamal could not match the records of Armand Martinez Sagi, though. He was Barcelona's youngest ever player and scorer at the age of 14 in the Catalan Championship in 1920 - nine years before Spain had a national league. Among the few major records he has missed out on are youngest player in the Champions League (Youssoufa Moukoko was 16 years and 18 days for Borussia Dortmund against Zenit St Petersburg in 2020) or La Liga (Luka Romero was 15 years and 219 days old when he appeared for Mallorca against Real Madrid in 2020). He has yet to net in the Champions League and will not have the chance to break Ansu Fati's record as youngest scorer, aged 17 years and 40 days for Barcelona against Inter Milan in 2019, in that tournament now. This video can not be played 'The next superstar' - pundits praise Yamal On 8 September 2023, Yamal became Spain's youngest player and goalscorer in the same game - a 7-1 win over Georgia in Euro 2024 qualifying. He was aged 16 years and 57 days when he replaced Dani Olmo just before half-time. That was before he had even scored for Barcelona. Only Martin Odegaard, who was 15 years and 300 days when he played for Norway in 2014, has been younger while playing a European Championship qualifier. In this summer's finals, Yamal has broken nearly every record there is to break - even though he has been doing school homework during some of his downtime in Germany. He became the first 16-year-old to play at a men's Euros when he started their group opener against Croatia. Yamal also set up Dani Carvajal's goal for 3-0 in that game, making him the youngest to assist in Euros history. In the semi-final against France he became the youngest goalscorer in European Championship history - aged 16 years and 362 days. In that game he passed two Pele landmarks that have stood since 1958 - the youngest player to score at a Euros or World Cup - and the youngest to feature in the semi-finals of either. And then he broke Pele's record as the youngest player in either final. The only quirky milestone he missed out on was the chance to become the first 16-year-old and the first 17-year-old to score at a Euros. He turned 17 the day before the final - and the previous youngest Euros goalscorer was Johan Vonlanthen at the age of 18. Since his debut in September 2023, Yamal has been involved in more goals for Spain than anyone else (three goals, seven assists) Allow Instagram content?

388,'I'm not at level of Alcaraz or Sinner' - Djokovic,"Djokovic has failed to win a title in 2024 Novak Djokovic says he is ""not at that level"" after falling to a chastening defeat against Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles Wimbledon final. The 24-time Grand Slam winner looked almost helpless as Alcaraz powered to a 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-4) win - his second straight victory over Djokovic in the SW19 showpiece. It is another result that marks a changing of the guard in men's tennis. Between them, 21-year-old Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, 22, have won all three of this year's Grand Slam tournaments. ""Both of them are the best this year by far, I feel like I'm not at that level,"" said 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic. ""In order to really have a chance to, I guess, beat these guys in Grand Slam latter stages or Olympics, I'm going to have to play much better than I did today and feel much better than I did today."" Yet to win a title this year, it has been Djokovic's worst start to a season since 2006. The 37-year-old was outplayed by Alcaraz in Sunday's final, with the young Spaniard reeling off deft drop shots, hefty serves and thunderous forehand winners. ""Just overall the way I felt on the court today against him, I was inferior on the court,"" Djokovic said in his news conference. ""That's it. He was a better player. He played every single shot better than I did."" When Djokovic fell a break down in the fourth set of last year's final, he took out his frustrations by smashing his racquet against the net post. However, there was barely a flicker of emotion from the seven-time Wimbledon champion when he found himself two sets to love down on Sunday. Nick Kyrgios, a runner-up to Djokovic in 2022, described him as being ""so flat"". ""I would have liked to have seen – whether it was a racquet smash or a roar or something – after Novak went down those two sets, I needed to see an outburst to kind of reset his energy,"" Kyrgios told BBC TV.  ""He was so flat for so long and then there was a game at 3-2 in the third set where he really came alive, but it was a bit too late."" This video can not be played Novak Djokovic's reaction to his defeat in Wimbledon final The Serb underwent surgery on a medial meniscus tear in his right knee less than a month before his first-round match. ""If someone told me I would play Wimbledon finals three, four weeks ago, I would take it for sure,"" Djokovic said. Alcaraz said it was ""amazing"" and ""unbelievable"" what Djokovic had done over the fortnight, describing his opponent as ""superman"". ""I did all I can to prepare myself for this match and this tournament in general,"" added Djokovic. ""Today I saw that I was just, as I said, half a step behind him in every sense. That's the reality that I have to accept at the moment."" Despite feeling that his performances of late are not matching those of Sinner or Alcaraz, Djokovic has no plans to retire any time soon. He is still planning on competing for Serbia at the Olympic Games in Paris this summer with the hope of winning a gold medal - the only thing missing from his vast trophy collection. ""Hopefully I can find the right tennis because I'm going to need all I have and more to go to the final of the Olympic Games,"" Djokovic said. He added: ""As far as coming back here, I mean, I would love to. I don't have anything else in my thoughts right now that this is my last Wimbledon. ""I don't have any limitations in my mind. I still want to keep going and play as long as I feel like I can play on this high level."" 'An all-round perfect performance' - so what next for Alcaraz?

390,JD Vance once criticised Trump. Now he's his running mate,"“I’m a ‘never Trump’ guy. I never liked him.” “My god what an idiot.” “I find him reprehensible.” That was from JD Vance in interviews and on Twitter in 2016, when the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy catapulted him to fame. In the same year, he wrote privately to an associate on Facebook: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole ... or that he's America's Hitler"". A few short years later, Mr Vance transformed himself into one of Trump’s steadfast allies. And a few years after that the first-term senator from Ohio is now by Trump’s side as vice presidential running mate – and, by extension, an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 - with a reliably conservative voting record and midwestern roots that are sure to help boost the ticket at the ballot box. In fact, Mr Vance has made something of a habit of transformation. How did he emerge from a tough upbringing to reach the highest levels of American politics? Mr Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Although Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, Mr Vance identified closely with his family’s roots slightly to the south in Appalachia, the vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest. It includes some of the country’s poorest areas. Mr Vance painted an honest portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of his family members and friends. And his book also took a decidedly conservative view – describing them as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on welfare payments and mostly failing to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”. “The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.” While he poured scorn on ""elites"" and exclusive society, he painted himself as a counterpoint to the chronic failure of those he grew up with. By the time the book came out, Mr Vance’s own bootstrap tugging had slung him far away from Middletown: first to the US Marines and a tour of duty in Iraq, and later to Ohio State University, Yale Law School and a job as a venture capitalist in California. Hillbilly Elegy made him not only into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white working-class voters, and he rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee. “I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016.  ""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.”    In 2017 Mr Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whom he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. As the child of Indian immigrants who grew up in San Diego, Usha Vance has a very different background from her husband. She also attended Yale as an undergraduate and received a masters degree from University of Cambridge. She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after law school and is currently a litigator. Mr Vance's name was long whispered about as a political candidate, and he saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, he got a kick-start via a $10m  (£7.7m) donation by his former boss, Silicon Valley power broker Peter Thiel. But the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected in increasingly Republican Ohio was his past criticism of Trump. He apologised for his previous remarks and managed to mend fences and earn Trump’s endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate.  In the process, Mr Vance has become an increasingly important player in the world of Make America Great Again politics – and has signed up almost completely to Trump’s agenda. In the Senate he has been a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine. Given his short tenure in the Democrat-led chamber, the bills he has sponsored have rarely moved forward and they tend to send more messages than change policies. In recent months, Mr Vance introduced bills to withhold federal funds for colleges where there are encampments or Gaza-Israel war protests and for colleges that employ undocumented immigrants, for example. Showing both his foreign policy hawkishness and his background in finance, Mr Vance sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government off from US capital markets if it does not follow international trade law. Mr Vance, who was baptized as a Catholic in 2019, is anti-abortion, but has recently backed Trump’s view that the matter should be left up to individual states to decide. When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Mr Vance's views.",2024-07-15 23:10:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-15 21:10:37,,True
397,Five questions for Secret Service after Trump shooting,"Several major questions have emerged for the US Secret Service to answer in the aftermath of the shooting of Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. The FBI has taken on the role of lead investigator into the incident, during which one person was killed and two others critically injured - while Trump was wounded in the ear. As the US demands answers, the Secret Service says it is working to discover ""what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again"".  Its chief, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before a committee of the US House of Representatives on 22 July. Here are some of the questions that experts have started asking. It remains unclear how suspected gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks got access to the roof of a building near the rally that was little more than 130m (430 ft) from Trump. The rooftop was a known vulnerability before the event, according to NBC News, which cited two sources familiar with Secret Service operations. “Someone should have been on the roof or securing the building so no one could get on the roof,” NBC quoted one of the sources as saying. As well as the access question, it has been suggested that the line of sight from the rooftop to Trump's podium area should have been blocked off.  Crooks should not have been able to get a direct sight of Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC News on Monday.  Mr Mayorkas said officials would ""really study the event independently, and make recommendations to the Secret Service and to me"". An eyewitness to the shooting told the BBC that he and others had ""clearly"" spotted Crooks crawling around on the roof with a rifle. They alerted police but the suspect continuing moving around for several minutes before firing shots and then being shot dead himself, the eyewitness said. FBI special agent Kevin Rojek admitted it had been ""surprising"" that the attacker had been able to open fire. The county sheriff has confirmed that Crooks was spotted by a local police officer, who was unable to stop him in time. Something that remains unclear is whether this information reached the agents around Trump. Crooks was already on officials' radar, according to a senior law enforcement official. They anonymously told CNN that officers thought he was acting suspiciously near the event magnetometers. This information was allegedly relayed to the Secret Service.  The gunman fired his shots from what police have described as a ""secondary ring"", which was patrolled not by the Secret Service but by local and state officers.  A former Secret Service agent said this sort of arrangement only worked when there was a clear plan on what to do when a danger was spotted.  “When you rely on the local law enforcement partners, you better have carefully planned and told them what you expect them to do about a threat,” Jonathan Wackrow told the Washington Post. The county sheriff has admitted there had been ""a failure"" but said there was no single party to blame. A former chair of the House Oversight Committee has suggested that the Secret Service was ""spread too thin"", which compounded the issue that local police would not have been ""trained up"" to secure an event like Saturday's rally. Jason Chaffetz, who has previously reported on Secret Service failures, told the Washington Post there was no bigger ""threat profile"" than for Trump or President Biden, but that this was not reflected in the security presence in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has denied suggestions that a request from the Trump team to beef up the staffing had been rebuffed in advance of the rally. But the Post reported that it had seen an exchange of messages in which a former Secret Service officer asked colleagues how the suspect had got a gun so close to Trump. He was reported to have received the reply: ""Resources."" In a statement on Monday, Ms Cheatle said changes had been made to Trump's Secret Service detail ahead of the start of the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on Monday. She said she was ""confident"" in the overall plan. The agents who shielded Trump have received praise, including from former agent Robert McDonald, who said they did a ""fairly good job"" despite there being no exact ""playbook"" on what to do in such a situation.  But the question has also been asked whether they were fast enough to whisk the former president away into a vehicle. Footage of the incident shows them rapidly forming a shield around him in the immediate wake of the gunshots, but then appearing to pause as Trump asks to gather his shoes. The former president goes on to pump his fist for supporters. A Secret Service veteran told the New York Times he would not have waited. ""If that's me there, no. We are going, and we are going now,"" said Jeffrey James.  ""If it's me, I'm buying him a new pair of shoes.""

402,"'I was saved by luck or God,' Trump says","Former US President Donald Trump has said he is ""supposed to be dead"" after Saturday night's assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.  In one of his first interviews since the incident, Mr Trump told conservative US media he felt that he had been saved ""by luck or by God"".  “The most incredible thing was that I happened to not only turn [my head] but to turn at the exact right time and in just the right amount,"" he said, adding that the bullet that grazed his ear could have easily killed him. ""I’m supposed to be dead, I’m not supposed to be here,” he said. A spectator was killed in the attack, while two other people were seriously injured. The gunman, who also died, has been named as Thomas Matthew Crooks.  Mr Trump described the moment he looked up at the crowd after realising he had been shot. “The energy coming from the people there in that moment, they just stood there. It’s hard to describe what that felt like, but I knew the world was looking.  ""I knew that history would judge this, and I knew I had to let them know we are OK,” he told the Washington Examiner. Speaking as he prepared to board a flight to the upcoming Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he is expected to be confirmed as the party's candidate for president, Mr Trump said he now had a ""chance to bring the country together"". He said his speech would now be completely different instead of the ""humdinger"" aimed mostly at current President Joe Biden's policies he had previously planned.  “Had [Saturday's attack] not happened, this would’ve been one of the most incredible speeches. “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now. It is a chance to bring the country together.” Earlier, Mr Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he had intended to delay his trip to Wisconsin by two days. But he added that he was sticking to his original schedule as: ""I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling"". Mr Trump said that the assassination attempt ""has had an impact"" on him. Little is known about the motivation of Crooks, the 20-year-old would-be assassin who was shot dead by the Secret Service at the scene.  The FBI has said that while its investigation suggests Crooks acted alone, it would continue to look into whether the kitchen worker had received help.  The spectator who was killed in Saturday's attack has been named as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief who died trying to protect his family.  In a televised address following the attack, President Biden called for the ""temperature of politics"" to be lowered. ""We cannot, must not, go down this road again. We've travelled it before in our history,"" said Mr Biden, listing off a growing number of violent political acts that had taken place in the US in recent years. “In America we resolve our differences at the ballot box,"" he added. ""At the ballot box. Not with bullets.""",2024-07-15 23:10:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c29dn2j53w2o,"Kathryn Armstrong,",2024-07-15 08:10:38,,True
394,Tragedy at Trump rally upends election campaign - for now,"The 2024 election campaign has a new iconic image: Donald Trump, moments after narrowly avoiding serious injury or death from an assassin’s bullets, standing with his fist raised, lines of blood streaked across his face, an American flag billowing in the breeze behind him. “Fight! Fight! Fight!” the former president said, as some of the supporters, who moments before had feared for their lives, began cheering. The bloodshed in Pennsylvania will leave a lasting mark on the American psyche, puncturing the veneer of security around the highest levels of presidential politics – of magnetic screening, bulletproof limousines and heavily armed Secret Service agents. Even former presidents are not insulated from the violence that can erupt in everyday American life. It was also a dramatic moment in American political history; one that is sure to be replayed in video clips, still photographs and testimonial accounts throughout the course of this presidential campaign and in campaigns to come. In a rare address from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Joe Biden called on Americans to cool the temperature around political debate. ""[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field,"" he warned. ""No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence."" The attack has already begun coursing through America's partisan dialogue, as numerous Republicans have spoken out to condemn President Biden and the Democrats for creating a rhetorical environment conducive to the violence. They point to dire warnings about the former president becoming a dictator and threatening democracy as examples of the overheated language that could inspire an assassin. In particular, they highlight leaked comments the president made in private to donors just last week about increasing the attacks on the former president’s record and putting a “bull’s-eye” on him. “They've tried to take him out in so many other ways, financially, they've tried to throw him in jail,” Donald Trump Jr said in a television interview on Sunday. “It's almost as if they would love for this to happen.”  At least so far, however, the motives and political affiliations of the alleged assassin, 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident Thomas Matthew Crooks, are in doubt. They may ultimately defy an easy partisan narrative. The former president’s oldest son went on to add that, after the assassination attempt, those on the left can no longer accuse the former president of culpability for the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.  That violent episode took place hours after the then-president had held a rally just a few dozen blocks away, challenging the 2020 election results. His actions on that day led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives and, more than a year later, indictment by a special counsel appointed by the US attorney general. If the Pennsylvania shooting defuses this line of criticism by Democrats, it’s just one way in which it will have fundamentally reshaped this presidential campaign. Others may become clear over the course of the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday in Milwaukee. The failed attack on the former president plays into several themes the Trump campaign was already planning for the quadrennial gathering, which culminates with Trump taking the stage to accept his party’s nomination on Thursday night. The first is that it could provide a boost to the politics of grievance and persecution that have been a central focus of his rally speeches and social media posts. “They’re not really after me; they’re after you,” is a common Trump refrain, on t-shirts, billboards and car stickers. “I’m just in the way.” That message will land with new force after the former president and his crowd of supporters were sprayed with bullets. Trump’s legions of fans – many of whose support borders on near-messianic hero-worship - will have all the more reason to identify with a man who almost lost his life while standing before them. The former president’s brush with death, and subsequent acts of bloody defiance, will also fit with the contrast Trump campaign officials have said they are trying to draw at this week’s convention – one where their candidate, and party, embody rugged masculinity and strength, while their opponents are feeble. President Biden’s age and capabilities have dogged his campaign for months – and prompted a Democratic crisis of confidence in his re-election effort after a stunningly poor performance at the presidential debate just over two weeks ago. Saturday night’s attack, and Trump’s response to it, will allow Republicans to put that contrast in stark relief in the days ahead. Democrats have spent the past two weeks in anguished soul-searching over their president’s political future. Now, they have a new set of concerns. In a way, the assassination attempt may end up providing a political lifeline to Mr Biden, given that the focus has dramatically shifted away from his age-related struggles and internal attempts to oust him. But the president’s re-election strategy – which hinges on painting Trump as a danger to the nation if he again becomes president – could be seriously hampered if the American public is hostile to new, pointed criticisms of the man. The Biden campaign has already pulled all negative advertising directed at the former president, lest it be viewed as inappropriate given the national mood. The president also rescheduled a trip to Texas planned for Monday. It is only a pause, however, and Democrats will need to go back on the offensive if they hope to erase the narrow lead the former president holds. That lead – small and not insurmountable, but still significant - has held stable for months, even as national politics have been buffeted by a seemingly endless stream of unprecedented news stories. The former president’s trial and conviction, a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions, Mr Biden’s debate flop - none of these has seemed to move the American political needle in what has been, and appears destined to remain, a sharply divided nation. While there has been considerable talk about how this presidential campaign has been upended by the assassination attempt, there is no guarantee that the race will not return to its near-dead-heat equilibrium point in the three months before election day. Only now the Democrats have less time, less of a money advantage and less political oxygen to shift the electoral dynamics in their favour. What Saturday night’s tragedy demonstrated most clearly, however, is that expectations and political narratives can shift in seconds.",2024-07-15 23:10:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd172rp02e0o,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-15 02:10:38,,True
393,Biden urges America to 'lower temperature' after Trump shooting,"US President Joe Biden has condemned the assassination attempt on his predecessor Donald Trump in a primetime address from the White House, telling Americans that US politics must never be a ""killing field"". Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, was wounded in the ear after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and two more were critically injured in the attack.  In the Oval Office address - just the third of his presidency - Mr Biden urged Americans to ""take a step back"" and warned that ""political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated"".  ""No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence,"" Mr Biden said in remarks that lasted just under seven minutes.  His short, but forceful, address largely went off without a hitch, amid ongoing scrutiny following a number of high-profile verbal slips.  In his primetime address, the president called on Americans to come together and warned that increasing political polarisation meant November's election would be ""a time of testing"".  Mr Biden and Trump remain locked neck-and-neck in opinion polls ahead of the election.  Speaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Mr Biden listed off a growing number of violent political acts that have taken place in recent years.  ""We cannot, must not, go down this road again. We've travelled it before in our history,"" he said, citing shootings targeting congressional members in both parties, the assault on ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband and the 6 January riots. “In America we resolve our differences at the ballot box,"" he said. ""At the ballot box. Not with bullets."" Saturday's attack left America reeling, as Trump was struck in the ear shortly after he began speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.  In images beamed around the world, the 78-year-old could be seen with blood dripping from his ear and down his face, raising a defiant fist as Secret Service agents pulled him off stage and into a waiting car. The gunman - identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - was shot dead at the scene by Secret Service agents. Law enforcement agents told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that they discovered explosive materials in his vehicle nearby and at his home.  Officials say they are still investigating what motivated the attack. Crooks was a registered Republican who had previously donated $15 to a liberal campaign group in 2021, according to media reports. Classmates described him as a quiet young man who was bullied throughout school. A local gun club near his home in Pennsylvania confirmed he had been a member. In his speech, Mr Biden said he was praying for the family of Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former firefighter who was shot and killed - along with two others who were critically injured - during the rally. The father-of-two was killed while shielding his family from bullets as they whizzed past Trump and struck members of the audience.  Mr Biden called Mr Comperatore a ""hero"" who was killed ""while simply exercising his freedom to support a candidate of his choosing"". Allies of Trump's have been quick to blame President Biden and his campaign for the attack, alleging that the top Democrat had sought to stoke fears about his rival's return to office.  ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,"" JD Vance - a Republican senator who is under consideration for the vice-presidential nomination - wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  President Biden avoided addressing those criticisms in his address on Sunday night, though his campaign has temporarily pulled attack ads against Trump.  The former president himself has sought to strike a conciliatory tone since the shooting, thanking his Secret Service detail for their quick actions and calling on citizens to ""stand united"" and to ""show our True Character as Americans"". He arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday night for the Republican National Convention, where he will accept his party's nomination for president.  Trump is also expected to announce his running-mate. US media has reported that just three men are still under consideration for the vice-presidential slot: Florida Senator Marco Rubio, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and Senator Vance of Ohio. In a news conference earlier on Sunday, the Secret Service said they had no plans to impose additional security measures around the convention, saying they were satisfied with existing arrangements.  The agency has come under scrutiny as to how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump, despite members of the audience reportedly pointing him out to police.

412,Egyptian cyclist barred from Olympics over crash with team-mate,"An Egyptian track cyclist who collided with a rival team-mate will no longer compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics, after the Egyptian Olympic Committee (EOC) ruled that she should be barred over the incident. The EOC said Shahd Saeed, 19, was not eligible because of the one-year suspension from local competitions that was imposed by the Egyptian Cycling Federation in April. Many Egyptians had criticised her selection for the Olympics by the federation, whose president had said it was acting “in favour of Egypt”. In a TV interview following the EOC’s decision, Saeed admitted she was at fault for the crash with Ganna Eliwa but insisted it was “not deliberate”. “I wish I had represented Egypt in the Olympics and my efforts over three years had paid off,” she told a talk show. Eliwa, who is also 19, said she was happy that Saeed would be unable to compete. “It was expected,” she added. “Saeed does not deserve to be at Paris.” Eliwa was left concussed and with a broken right collarbone and severe cuts and bruises to the right-hand side of her body, according to a medical report, after she was pushed off her bike 300m (980ft) before the finishing line of an event in Suez on 27 April. In video footage of the incident, Saeed is seen riding behind Eliwa before she swerves, forcing Eliwa into the barrier. The latter underwent an operation to fix her right shoulder, suffered temporary loss of memory and is still unable to resume competitive cycling. Saeed said several times that it was an accident, but Eliwa said she never apologised for what happened. It was unclear what caused Saeed to swerve into her opponent. After an investigation into the incident, the Egyptian Cycling Federation suspended Saeed from the sport for one year and fined her the equivalent of $100 (£77) - the maximum penalty. Despite that, the federation still registered her for the track cycling at the Olympics. The decision sparked public anger in Egypt. Many social media users urged authorities to reconsider, with some saying the selection violated the values of Olympism - excellence, respect and friendship. In a statement issued late on Saturday, the EOC noted that the cycling federation had found that Saeed violated “the regulations, customs, values and ethics of sports” during April’s event. ""Shahd Saeed is not eligible to participate in any international competition, including the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, due to her one-year suspension until 26 April 2025,"" it said. The EOC also urged Egyptian media and public to support the remaining members of the national team at the Olympics.",2024-07-15 23:10:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe27re204zo,"David Gritten,",2024-07-15 12:10:39,,True

In the post, they also shared a picture of their children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis watching Sunday night's Euros final defeat to Spain, wearing England shirts bearing their names and ages. The couple's full message reads: ""England, your teamwork, grit and determination were an inspiration to all of us, young and old. Congratulations to Spain. W & C"" Prince William and his eldest son Prince George watched the game at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on Sunday evening. The Prince of Wales shook hands with the England team and handed them runners-up medals after the match. King Charles also sent a message to the England team after the match. In a letter to manager Gareth Southgate, he urged him and the team to ""hold your heads high"". England's heartbreaking 2-1 defeat left fans devastated, as many had hoped to see the men's team win a major trophy for the first time in 58 years. But many still had hope for the future.  Matthew Adams, 30, from Bournemouth, said: ""The future is so bright with the young players in the squad that have performed so well. ""If that's the future of England, then it's a positive future.""  Preethi Rai, 38, from London said Gareth Southgate ""deserves some credit"" for his work as England manager.  Speaking after the screening at London's O2 Arena she added: ""He's brought us up to a level where we can compete with an amazing Spain team."" Southgate and several England players were seen leaving their hotel in Berlin on Monday morning. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, England captain Harry Kane said he was ""heartbroken"" over the loss.  ""It was a long tough tournament and I’m so proud of the boys and staff for getting to the final,"" he said. Prince William was pictured with Prince George in the stands at the final on Sunday, seated near King Felipe and Princess Leonor of Spain, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He also attended earlier games in the tournament, watching England's quarter final victory over Switzerland, and the group stage match against Denmark.  Downing Street said Gareth Southgate had ""provided great leadership and done the country proud"". Asked if Mr Southgate would be knighted, a spokesman said: “Honours are a matter for the independent committee.” Earlier on Sunday, Catherine, Princess of Wales, took Princess Charlotte to Wimbledon to watch Carlos Alcaraz beat Novak Djokovic in the men's singles final.  It was Catherine's second public appearance following her cancer diagnosis and abdominal surgery earlier this year, and she was met with a standing ovation by spectators.

424,Defeat may be Southgate's last - but he'd leave England with head high,"Gareth Southgate has taken us on one heck of a journey over the past eight years, but I suspect Sunday’s defeat by Spain will be his last game as England manager. Right now Gareth will be hurting like hell after what happened in Berlin but my feeling is that, when the dust settles on the final of Euro 2024, he will decide he’s had enough. It should be his decision to stay or go - and I think it will be - but it is a tiring job and he has been doing it for a long time. If he does leave, he should go with his head held high because England are in a completely different place now compared to where they were when he took over in 2016. England were at rock bottom after losing to Iceland and becoming a laughing stock that summer, followed by the embarrassment of Sam Allardyce’s exit after his short stint in charge. England lose to Spain in Euro 2024 final - reaction What now for England, Southgate & Kane after same old pain? 'England have the best squad, but not the best team' Gareth came in and put a smile on everyone’s faces - bringing the squad together, getting us to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 and then the final of the European Championship in 2021, with a lesser squad than he had this time. He put the team in a much better position mentally and the spirit he nurtured helped us get to the final again. For achieving all of those things he deserves a huge amount of respect and gratitude, but it’s just unfortunate that - for all his excellent work - Gareth just wasn’t quite able to get the best out of this team in Germany, and that was the difference between us reaching another final and winning one. My guess is – and it is only a guess – he may now say to someone else that it is their turn to try to get England over the line. If he does, then he has put the team in an excellent position for someone to take the team forward, to take that next step and win a major tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 England Spain were the superior side, but I think we were all expecting more from England in Berlin. For starters, Spain dominated possession, which they had not done in a lot of their games over the past few weeks. They play in a slightly different way now to the way they did when they had success in the past, but we sort of stood off them and allowed them to play at their own pace. You can’t do that against a team with as many quality players as they have got, because they can hurt you. England found that out the hard way. We got away with it for a while in the second half because Jordan Pickford made a great save when they were 1-0 up and they missed a couple of really good chances to put the game out of sight. Then we got the changes from Gareth and an equaliser from one of the players who came on, and all of a sudden you are thinking hang on, here we go again. Another comeback… maybe, just maybe, another win. We had come from a goal down to get through each knockout round on our way to the final, and being a team of great moments rather than a great team had got us this far. It was not enough to derail Spain, however. They had deserved to win all six of their previous games at this tournament, and they deserved to win this one too. They sliced right through the middle of us to score their winner and they dominated us the way they have dominated the competition. Yes, we came close to nicking a second goal from a set-piece right at the end but, if we are being honest, we all know that Spain played the game the way that most people wanted England to play it, which is on the front foot. This video can not be played 'It hurts' - Shearer No-one can ever question this England side’s attitude or commitment – like their togetherness, they have shown they have all of that in abundance – but they have not been able to play the right kind of football for most of this tournament. We have seen glimpses of it, like in the first 30 minutes of the opening game against Serbia, or a similar spell in the first half of the semi-final against the Netherlands, but we have not really seen enough in any of the seven games we have played in Germany. This video can not be played 'We have to hold our hands up' - Southgate says Spain were deserved winners Our best spells in attack have come when we have reacted to something going wrong – in all four knockout games we have gone behind, which tells its own story. Then, all of a sudden, we got slightly better when, in an ideal world, we would not have had to wait. Finding a way to win is an impressive trait for any team to have, but it was not enough to take us to the trophy and of course that hurts. We had a better squad than three years ago and, because of the expectation Gareth’s success has put on this England team, we expect them to win now. If we are going to do that we are going to have to back our ability, the way Spain did against us when the game was in the balance. Gareth made some more big calls and he got them right but, this time, Spain made decisive changes too. When you are in a final, you have got to get over the line and they were the ones who did that. Unfortunately, we were not quite good enough to get the ending we all wanted this time.

436,Biden announces plan to cap rent hikes,"President Joe Biden has announced a new plan to halt rent increases in the US, as Americans battle soaring housing prices.  Mr Biden's proposal - which requires congressional approval - would cut off tax credits for landlords who try to raise rent by more than 5%.  The policy would apply to landlords who own more than 50 units, comprising about 20 million rental units across the country, according to the Biden administration.  Mr Biden said he hoped this plan would send a ""clear message to corporate landlords"".  ""Rent is too high and buying a home is out of reach for too many working families and young Americans, after decades of failure to build enough homes,"" the president said in a statement. ""I’m determined to turn that around."" The proposal does include an exception for new construction and buildings undergoing substantive renovations. As the US faces low housing stock, this carve out is aimed at encouraging new rental property construction to increase the number of apartments and homes available.  The announcement comes as Mr Biden is set to make a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Nevada, while Republicans gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for the party's national convention.  His proposal faces an uphill battle for approval in Congress, with administration officials reportedly acknowledging the president would have to focus on fighting for the housing plan during a second term.  The plan is aimed at stopping corporate landlords who are seeking to take advantage of the US housing shortage by raising rents at a higher rate than their own costs have increased, Mr Biden said.  Nationwide, rent prices have risen by 21% since January 2021, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.  Home prices are on the rise, too.  In early 2024, home prices hit an all-time record, rising 6.4% from February 2023 to 2024, according to a new report from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Mr Biden's plan to lower housing costs come as recent polls show he is trailing his rival, former President Donald Trump, in the 2024 presidential race.  Surveys show the economy is top of mind for voters in the 2024 election, with rising housing costs and ongoing inflation pressures among the top concerns.  As a part of his housing announcement, Mr Biden said he would also direct federal agencies to assess whether public land could be repurposed to build affordable housing options.  In Nevada, where Mr Biden is set to speak on Tuesday, the federal government is looking at 562 acres of public land in the Las Vegas Valley that could be used for affordable housing, according to a White House fact sheet.

But the Ohio senator and running mate of Republican White House candidate Donald Trump has previously said he feels “humbled” by the stellar CV of his wife, Usha Vance. While she does not seek out the political spotlight, Mrs Vance, 38, wields considerable influence over her husband’s career, he has said. In an interview on Fox News last month, she said: ""I believe in JD, and I really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life."" The two met as students at Yale Law School in 2013, when they joined a discussion group on “social decline in white America”, according to the New York Times. The content influenced Mr Vance's best-selling 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class Rust Belt, which became a 2020 movie directed by Ron Howard. Mr Vance, 39, has said he considered her his “Yale spirit guide” when they were classmates at the elite university. Mrs Vance previously graduated with a BA in history from Yale University and was also a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she came away with an MPhil in early modern history, according to her LinkedIn profile. The couple wed in 2014 and have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel. Mrs Vance - née Chilukuri, the child of Indian immigrants - was born and raised in the suburbs of San Diego, California. Her husband regularly rails about ""woke"" ideas he says are pushed by Democrats, but his wife was formerly a registered Democrat and is now a corporate litigator at a San Francisco law firm which proudly touts its reputation for being “radically progressive”. Mrs Vance once clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, on the District of Columbia court of appeals. Then she clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Both men are part of the highest court's conservative majority. “Usha definitely brings me back to Earth a little bit,” Mr Vance told the Megyn Kelly Show podcast in 2020. “And if I maybe get a little bit too cocky or a little too proud I just remind myself that she is way more accomplished than I am.” “People don’t realise just how brilliant she is,” he added, saying she is able to digest a 1,000-page book in only a few hours.

441,JD Vance's 'Hillbilly Elegy' becomes political lightning rod in 2024 election,"As American voters start to familiarize themselves with Donald Trump's newly announced vice-presidential candidate Ohio Senator JD Vance it is nearly impossible to avoid his infamous memoir.   Written in 2016,  ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,"" tells the story of Mr Vance's upbringing in the Appalachian region of the US, which includes his home state of Ohio, and offers a glimpse at what he says life is like for the poor who live in rural areas.  The book, which has garnered critique in the years since it was published, has become a new political lightning rod in the 2024 presidential race as some critics of Mr Vance say it shows a lack of understanding of what it means to be from the region while others argue the opposite. Fans of the rising GOP star are also captivated by the book and purchasing it in large numbers, watching its movie adaptation on streaming platforms and claiming it shows Mr Vance is an everyday man.  The memoir, in its text form or the movie adaptation - which received several Academy Award nominations, may offer voters a glimpse of who Mr Vance is and how he views his upbringing.  The book has become such a popular talking point online that the popular book recommendation site Goodreads blocked new reviews after Trump made the Ohio senator his running mate.  As of Tuesday, users who went to book platform to review Mr Vance's book were met with a popup that read: ""Rating this book is temporarily unavailable. This book has temporary limitations on submitting ratings and reviews. This may be because we've detected unusual behavior that doesn't follow our review guidelines"". This is likely to stop users from review bombing - negatively reviewing something for reasons not associated with the topic itself. Goodreads declined to comment after asked by the BBC about why users had been unable to rate the book. Review bombing, which often happens to movies, books and restaurants after controversy, has become an increasingly common way for people to share their displeasure with something while attempting to sabotage a product, place or person.  In the online era, the practice is only growing in popularity.  It happened to acclaimed ""Eat Pray Love"" writer Elizabeth Gilbert last year after she authored a book readers said was ""glorifying"" Russians. Readers review bombed the book online to the point where Ms Gilbert paused publication.  On top of the online criticism of Mr Vance's book, the movie adaptation has also seen some online hate.  In recent days, Letterboxd, a Goodreads equivalent for movies, also saw an uptick in reviews of the movie adaptation of the book directed by Ron Howard and starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.  But it is not all hate.  The book, in paperback and hardcover, currently ranks No. 1 and No. 2 on Amazon's best-selling books.  The film, which was released in 2020 and received multiple Academy Award nominations at the time, shot to No. 6 on Netflix's top 10 movies the day after Mr Vance's selection was announced.  And while the memoir tells the story of his upbringing, its publication marks the launch of his political career.

440,UK deputy prime minister dismisses Vance 'Islamist UK' claim,"The deputy prime minister has dismissed comments by Donald Trump's running mate for US vice president that UK under Labour might be the first ""truly Islamist"" country with nuclear weapons. JD Vance, the Ohio senator chosen as Trump's vice presidential candidate on Monday night, made the comments while at the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC last week. The 39-year-old said he was ""beating up"" on the UK, and had discussed with a friend “what is the first truly Islamist country to get a nuclear weapon"", then joked ""maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan kind of counts, and then we sort of decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labour just took over"". The suggestion that Islamists are gaining in power in some European countries with Muslim minorities is common in some right-wing US political circles. Angela Rayner told ITV that Mr Vance had said ""quite a lot of fruity things in the past"" but said does not ""recognise"" his characterisation of the UK.  She added that she ""looked forward"" to meeting him and Donald Trump if they won the US election in November. His comments on the UK becoming an “Islamist country” were a direct criticism of Labour’s approach to immigration, and he also said that the Tories “have got to get a handle on this”.  Right-wing US political figures have often linked immigration to a rise in Islamism in a country and have regularly focused on the UK. During his speech to the National Conservatism conference Mr Vance made several further comments attacking immigration. He declared: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."" In the speech Mr Vance also said “I was in London last year, and it’s not doing so good” referring to both high house prices and high immigration, making a link between those. Speaking on ITV, Ms Rayner said: ""I'm very proud of the election success that Labour had recently. ""We won votes across all different communities, across the whole of the country, and we're interested in governing on behalf of Britain and also working with our international allies."" Mr Vance's comments were also criticised by Exchequer Secretary James Murray. Mr Murray told Sky News: ""I don't know what he was driving at in that comment, to be honest. I mean, in Britain, we're very proud of our diversity. ""I'm very proud that we have a new government, I'm very proud that our Labour government is committed to national security and economic growth. I'm very clear where we are.  ""I don't really know how that comment fits in."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy has spent recent months consciously seeking to forge strong relations with Donald Trump’s allies, among them Mr Vance. Mr Lammy met Mr Vance alongside several Trump allies during a goodwill mission to the US in May, describing him as his ""friend"". In a speech at the right-leaning Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Vance was ""right to say we in Europe have a problem that we need to fix with higher defence expenditure"". He also said Trump has been “often misunderstood” when it comes to Nato, that he “gets the agenda that drives America First”, and that he would find “common cause” with a Trump administration. But Mr Vance's selection could pose a challenge for the new Labour government if Trump returns to the White House. Former US President Trump has opted for one of the most isolationist members of the Republican Party.  The former Trump-critic, now Trump-evangelist, opposes aiding Ukraine - while Sir Keir Starmer has committed to spending £3bn on aid for Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"". On Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson met Trump on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. ""We discussed Ukraine and I have no doubt that he will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy,"" Mr Johnson posted on X.  Mr Vance has also criticised Europe's overdependence on the US in foreign policy - potentially straining US-UK relations.  Regardless of Mr Vance’s recent intervention, Labour believes their diplomacy with Trump’s team is beginning to bear fruit.  Labour sources point to Sir Keir's conversation with the ex-president on Sunday in the aftermath of the assassination attempt - the first time the pair had spoken. Andrew Bowie, the shadow veterans minister, said he ""absolutely"" disagreed with the claim that Labour was creating an ""Islamist country"". He told Times Radio: ""I disagree with the Labour Party fundamentally on many issues, but I do not agree with that view, quite frankly.  ""I think it's actually quite offensive, frankly, to my colleagues in the Labour Party.""

430,Defeated Trump rivals to preach unity at Republican convention,"Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from Butler As my colleagues report from the RNC in Milwaukee, I've spent most of the day in Butler, Pennsylvania, speaking to
people who were at the Trump rally on Saturday. The area around the rally site is still very much a crime scene,
with police officers protecting the area near the building
from where they believe Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at the former president. Still, it's a much calmer atmosphere than when I was last here in the hours after the rally, when the entire area was cordoned off by
heavily armed officers as helicopters flew overhead. The overwhelming feeling among attendees I've spoken to is of
anger at the US Secret Service, which they believe made fatal mistakes in its
mission to protect the venue. ""They definitely dropped the ball,"" says Jean Vincent, a
Butler resident who was at the rally with her sister. ""I'm upset someone could have killed us, and my
children,"" she adds. ""It's changed America and it's changed our
community."" The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, will face
the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on 22 July. The next day, she, along with the heads of the FBI and Department
of Homeland Security, have been invited to a separate Homeland Security Committee hearing. Some in Butler, however, say that they will only be satisfied if
Cheatle leaves her post. ""All I want to hear from her is that she resigns,""

429,Senator Bob Menendez found guilty in bribery scheme,"New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez has been found guilty on 16 counts tied to a scheme where he accepted bribes, including gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, in exchange for helping foreign governments. A jury convicted Menendez of all charges after more than 12 hours of deliberation over three days. The trial lasted nine weeks. Menendez - formerly the head of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee - now faces the prospect of decades in prison. Democratic lawmakers have called on him to step down from Congress in light of his conviction.  ""Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign,"" said Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer in a statement. Speaking to reporters after his conviction, Menendez maintained that he is innocent.  ""I never violated my public oath,"" he said outside the New York City courthouse on Tuesday. ""I have never been but a patriot of my country and for my country."" His lawyer, Adam Fee, said that he was ""surprised and disappointed"" with the jury's guilty verdict and has vowed to appeal ""aggressively."" Prosecutors said the case represented ""shocking levels of corruption."" ""This wasn't politics as usual, this was politics for profit,"" said Damian Williams, an attorney for the Southern District of New York.  ""Now that the jury has convicted Bob Menendez, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end,"" Mr Williams said.  Menendez pleaded not guilty in the trial. His lawyers argued that the gifts he accepted did not qualify as bribes, because prosecutors had failed to prove that he took any specific action as a result of receiving them. His wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, also faces charges in the bribery case, but her trial was delayed so she could undergo breast cancer treatment. She has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers had attempted to shift blame to Mrs Menendez, portraying her as a financially troubled individual who hoped to ""get cash and assets any way she could"". Meanwhile, prosecutors relied on expert testimony, emails and Menendez's text messages to show that the senator accepted lavish rewards from foreign governments. They said the gifts included gold bars worth over $100,000 (£79,000). Some of the bars were handed to jurors as evidence in the trial.  Jurors also heard that FBI agents had found more than $480,000 (£370,452) in cash inside of Menendez's home, some of which was stuffed in envelopes and coats. Two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are also being tried on accusations that they sought out the senator to illegally aid the Egyptian government and secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund.  A third businessman, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified against Mr Menendez in the trial. In exchange the bribes, prosecutors said Menendez helped secure millions of dollars in US aid for Egypt, where Hana had ties to government officials. He was also accused of trying to influence criminal probes involving Daibes and Uribe. Both businessmen were co-defendants in Menendez's case and were also convicted on the counts they faced.  Menendez is currently running as an independent as he campaigns to keep his seat in November's election. Most Democrats in the state walked away from him last year after the release of the indictment showing gold bars stashed in his home. Andy Kim, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, said the verdict marked ""a sad and sombre day"" for his state. ""I called on Senator Menendez to step down when these charges were first made public, and now that he has been found guilty, I believe the only course of action for him is to resign his seat immediately,"" Mr Kim said in a statement. ""The people of New Jersey deserve better,"" he said. The senator has faced federal corruption charges before. He was tried in 2017, with the justice department alleging he did political favours for a wealthy Florida eye doctor in exchange for luxury holidays and other lavish gifts. But that case ended in a mistrial after he was acquitted on some charges and jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqe6m14drgjo,"Bernd Debusmann Jr & Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-16 19:09:37,,True
449,Aly Raisman on competing at the highest level,"The decorated US gymnast opened up to the BBC's Katty Kay about blocking out the noise, trusting her training and her winning mindset. While many 30-year-olds may have one-track careers, US gymnast Aly Raisman can add ""author and advocate"" to a CV already filled with Olympic achievements. The two-time Olympian won six medals as part of the 2012 Team USA ""Fierce Five"" at the London Games, and the 2016 ""Final Five"" at Rio de Janeiro, but is just as proud of her work keeping athletes safe as she is of her time on the podium.  Raisman was one of the victims who suffered abuse at the hands of former Team USA Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. She spoke to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay in this new episode of her Olympian-focused interview series, Influential, about life after the case, her cherished Olympic memories and what legacy she hopes will endure. Back in 2012, Raisman (then aged 18) was tied for fourth place and not expected to medal on the balance beam at the Games in London. She left London the most decorated athlete on the gymnastics team, with three medals. She'd become the first US woman to win gold for the gymnastics floor exercise and Team USA had taken home the women's artistic gymnastics team all-round gold. She'd also won a bronze medal in the balance beam, which still seems to surprise Raisman to this day. Where to find Influential with Katty Kay ""It was such a special experience because I wasn't expected to medal on beam – so getting that bronze medal was one of my most proud moments,"" Raisman tells Kay. Even without the ""pressure to win"", Raisman recalls a fearsome experience. ""Competing in that arena… it's so terrifying, the tension in the arena – you could literally hear a bag of chips open, it's so quiet, so nerve-wracking. You could hear the clicking of the camera! I was so proud of myself for handling that pressure."" Raisman tells Kay that her confidence was affected from the stress and pressure, but after a career-changing pep talk from her coach, she was able to block out the noise, focus on the cheers from her teammates, and get into what she calls a ""flow state"", winning the gold medal on her floor routine.  ""I just had to let go and not think,"" Raisman tells Kay, remembering that moment. ""To this day, it was the best floor routine I've ever done in my entire life. I just felt in a state of 'flow' – which I've never been in before competing. I think because my practice was so stressful… and I was struggling so much, and my confidence wasn't great, letting it go was the best decision I made. I did my first pass on the floor and I just knew the rest of the routine was fine; I felt free and it felt great."" Kay notes that Raisman's smile revealed her happiness to be there, but Raisman reminded her that she also thought it might be the last floor routine of her life at the time and she wanted to do her best for herself, her teammates, her coach, and the country. Yet Raisman kept growing as an athlete and competitor – and as a team leader. ""I was 18 going into London’s 2012 Olympic games; I had just graduated high school,"" Raisman reminds Kay. ""I was such a baby. Going into Rio in 2016, I was 22 years old; I was still so young! But I had been around, so I knew. In London, I was the captain, but still so young. But I felt older in 2016 and my role had shifted in the team. I felt more of that 'mum' role."" Not only did Raisman have to adjust to being the team elder, she faced a lot of change upon returning home to the United States from both London and Rio. Suddenly, she was known around the world; her face was on the covers of magazines. ""It surpassed my expectations – how many people supported us and watched [the Games] and knew us,"" Raisman admits. ""I don't feel like I'll ever get used to [fame]; I'm still navigating it. I went from being in high school… to getting recognised when I go get coffee. I forget people sometimes know who I am! I never imagined that I would have achieved this, still getting recognised [eight years later]. I surpassed my expectations and I'm grateful for that."" Much like Raisman handled mentorship and fame with maturity beyond her years, she wanted to turn her trauma into something that would help people beyond the gymnastics community and use her platform for mental health advocacy. She recently wrote a children's book called From My Head to My Toes, to help young readers understand concepts like consent and bodily autonomy. ""I wanted to write something that empowers children and adults to speak up, while also acknowledging that it's hard to speak up,"" Raisman says. ""I'm 30 years old and it's still hard to speak up. I'm still working on it. But even if [this book] helps one kid be safer and even if it prevents anyone from having to go through what me and my teammates went through, I feel proud of that."" Raisman has also combined her mental health advocacy efforts with her love of fashion and tells Kay that some of the best advice she ever got was from someone she admires in the fashion industry: the shoe designer, Stuart Weitzman. She tells Kay that when the post-Olympics media pressure got to be too much, it was Weitzman who told her something that changed her life. ""The media kept asking if I was coming back for a third Olympics,"" Raisman explains. ""I felt like, 'isn't one [Olympics] enough?' I remember I met with Stuart Weitzman who said to me: 'Don't let the Olympics be the highlight of your life' – and that was one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received. I think about it all the time!""

To Raisman, gymnastics was a literal springboard to empowering people to take care of themselves and others. Just as she's learned to use her voice to speak up in tough moments, she's also learned to compartmentalise, and tells Kay it's not always easy.  ""So many athletes define their worth by their result,"" she tells Kay, ""But [Weitzman's advice] helped me realise that I can go on to do other great things. Obviously winning medals is really exciting and wonderful, but I do hope when people look back at my career, hopefully they remember that I helped make athletes safer and I encouraged people to prioritise mental health."" -- Want to read more about the Olympics?

445,Why Trump picked JD Vance as his running mate,"In 2016, when Donald Trump picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate, it  was widely viewed as an effort to court evangelical Christian voters who may have been wary of supporting Trump, a thrice-married former Democrat. This time around, he opted for JD Vance. And like his previous choice, the Ohio senator’s selection offers some insight into the former president’s campaign strategy – and, possibly, how he would govern if he returns to the White House. The pick suggests Trump knows this election will be won and lost in a handful of industrial Midwest battleground states. A native of Ohio, Mr Vance gained popular attention after the release of his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which tells of his blue-collar upbringing and how it affected his politics and worldview.  With his background, Vance could be well positioned to connect with and energise the kind of white, working class voters who narrowly delivered those states to Trump in 2016. The former president said as much, in the social media post announcing his decision, writing that his running mate “will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota and far beyond"". Trump went on to laud his pick's military service and his Ivy League law school pedigree. At only 39, Vance will provide a youthful counterpoint to the candidates at the top of both presidential tickets. Trump’s choice positions the Ohioan to be at the forefront of a new generation of Maga Republicans. And if the former president returns to the Oval Office next year, Vance will instantly join the conversation for the party’s 2028 presidential nomination. Vance did, however, criticise Trump in the run-up to the election in 2016 - something Democrats were quick to point out - but he has since become an outspoken defender of the former president, particularly on television news networks.  His recent loyalty, and effectiveness, no doubt factored into Trump’s decision. When asked whether he believed Trump’s 2020 election defeat was fairly decided, he has said no. He has also said that, unlike Mr Pence, he would have tried to block the certification of the election results in Congress on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol riot. Mr Vance also aligns closely with the former president’s political ideology. They have similar views on trade, immigration and foreign policy. Mr Vance has been particularly critical of continued US support for Ukraine. In areas where the two men differed, Mr Vance has moved toward his new running mate. He has, for example, backed away from an earlier stand against allowing women who are the victims of rape or incest from having access to abortions. Trump over the course of his campaign has laid out some of his plans for governing in a second term – with across-the-board tariffs, a pledge to deport tens of millions of undocumented migrants and an aggressive realignment of the federal bureaucratic workforce. The Vance pick is further evidence that Trump has doubled-down on Trumpism. That, too, is something his Democratic opponents are sure to point out. On Monday, Mr Biden told reporters he didn’t see any difference between Mr Vance and the former president. “He’s a clone of Trump on the issues,” he added. That, of course, may be exactly what Trump wants.",2024-07-16 23:09:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv50z8dzj5o,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-16 04:09:38,,True
474,Police were stationed in building Trump gunman shot from,"Police were stationed inside the building from which gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots at Donald Trump, the director of the US Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle says. Ms Cheatle told ABC News that local police were inside the building while Crooks was on the roof, and that local police - not the Secret Service - had been “responsible"" for securing the building and its outer perimeter.  Questions have swirled about how police officers and agents tasked with securing Trump's Pennsylvania rally allowed Crooks to get as close as he did. He was able to access the roof of a building near the outdoor event at Butler County fairgrounds, Pennsylvania, from where he shot at Trump 130m (430ft) away. The local police deployment inside the building comprised three snipers, who are alleged to have seen Crooks trying to get on the roof, according to sources quoted by CBS News, the BBC's US partner.  One audience member was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. Trump was wounded in the ear. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that his agency was responsible for securing inside the perimeter of the fairgrounds, while local police secured the area outside, which included the private building used by the gunman. The local sheriff's department referred BBC questions to the state police, which said it was not responsible for the area containing the building. A state police spokesman told the BBC that it provided ""all resources"" requested by the Secret Service, including between 30 to 40 troopers inside the perimeter. Many observers have questioned how security plans broke down to allow the gunman unobstructed access to Trump. Crowd members said they had spotted the suspect on the roof minutes before the shooting started, while Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe said a local security officer had also spotted him but could not stop him. The sheriff admitted there had been ""a failure"" in securing the premises, but said he believed that there was no single party to blame. It is common for the US Secret Service to rely on local police for help when securing rallies, said Jason Russell, founder of Secure Environments Consultants who worked as an agent from 2002 to 2010, including during election campaigns. “The Secret Service doesn’t have unlimited resources in terms of agents that they can post everywhere,” he told the BBC. He said that agents usually scope out a campaign event’s venue days in advance to develop a security plan that is then shared with local police agencies. During an event, he said communications were shared with every agency involved. However, he added that in ""the 10 seconds that it takes"" for information to flow through, that could be just enough time for a gunman to fire a few shots. The rooftop was a known vulnerability before the event, according to NBC News, which cited two sources familiar with Secret Service operations. Mr Russell said it was probable that Secret Service agents identified that building as a threat, and had requested local authorities to station officers nearby to prevent access. “For whatever reason, that didn’t happen,” he said. One witness, Thomas Gleason, who served 21 years with the US Army as paratrooper and ranger, said ""there should have been greater security for a long-range threat"". ""Looking at the distance and vantage point, if someone is going to try to assassinate [Trump] that would have been the most logical shooting point,"" he said. The FBI has since taken over the role of lead investigator into the incident, and the shooting is now the subject of several other investigations by both the House and the Senate. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas called it a “failure” of security, telling CNN that ""an incident like this cannot happen again"". Ms Cheatle said on Monday that her agency is working with federal and local police to ""understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from taking place again"". ""The buck stops with me,"" she said in the ABC interview, adding that she would not step down in the face of mounting calls from some lawmakers. A briefing for Senators on 17 July left many questions unanswered, with Senator Ron Johnson describing the call as ""unbelievably uninformative"", with only four questions permitted.  John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, told CBS that the senators were told Crooks was identified well before the attack and he was found carrying a range finder and a backpack.  ""The Secret Service lost sight of him,"" he added. ""No one has taken responsibility. No one has been held responsible.""  Ms Cheatle has been subpoenaed to face the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on 22 July. Republicans on the committee have also called on the Secret Service to produce evidence including internal communications, audio and video recordings, messages to local law enforcement, maps, diagrams and pre-event assessments. Additionally, House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that a bipartisan task force will be assembled to investigate the assassination attempt and concerns about how security was handled.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd167v5lpq2o,"Bernd Debusmann Jr,",2024-07-17 22:11:08,,True

463,JD Vance was once 'never Trump'. Now he's his running mate,"“I’m a ‘never Trump’ guy. I never liked him.” “My god what an idiot.” “I find him reprehensible.” That was from JD Vance in interviews and on Twitter in 2016, when the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy catapulted him to fame. In the same year, he wrote privately on Facebook to Josh McLaurin, his former law school roommate, now a state Senator in Georgia: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole... or that he's America's Hitler"". 'To go from those texts... to being Trump's biggest cheerleader, it's just kind of unbelievable,"" Mr McLaurin, who is a member of the Democratic Party, told BBC Newshour. A few short years later, Mr Vance transformed himself into one of Trump’s steadfast allies. The first-term senator from Ohio is now by Trump’s side as vice-presidential running mate – and, by extension, an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 – with a reliably conservative voting record and Midwestern roots that Republicans hope will boost support at the ballot box. In fact, Mr Vance has made something of a habit of transformation. How did he emerge from a tough upbringing to reach the highest levels of American politics? Mr McLaurin told BBC Newshour that his former roommate previously felt like the Republican party needed to give working people hope as well as economic opportunities. If unsuccessful in doing so, Mr Vance believed a ""demagogue"" would fill that vacancy, he said.  According to Mr McLaurin, Mr Vance saw Trump as the demagogue.  When asked why Mr Vance has changed his stance on Trump, Mr McLaurin said he thinks it has to do with a ""deep-seated anger"". ""There’s this joke that men would rather run for office than go to therapy and I think that’s probably especially true in his case,"" he said.  Mr Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Mr Vance was adopted by his stepfather when he was six years old. He dropped his middle and last names - changing Donald, his biological father's name, to David, which preserved his nickname of JD. His last name changed from Bowman to Hamel, his stepfather's last name.  His mother split from his then-stepfather a few years later.  When he married after graduating law school, the couple took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance.  Although Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, Mr Vance identified closely with his family’s roots slightly to the south in Appalachia, the vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest. It includes some of the country’s poorest areas. Mr Vance painted an honest portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of his family members and friends. And his book also took a decidedly conservative view – describing them as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on welfare payments and mostly failing to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”. “The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.” While he poured scorn on ""elites"" and exclusive society, he painted himself as a counterpoint to the chronic failure of those he grew up with. By the time the book came out, Mr Vance’s own bootstrap tugging had slung him far away from Middletown: first to the US Marines and a tour of duty in Iraq, and later to Ohio State University, Yale Law School and a job as a venture capitalist in California. Hillbilly Elegy made him not only into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white, working-class voters.  He rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee. “I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016.  ""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.”   In 2017 Mr Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whom he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. As the child of Indian immigrants who grew up in San Diego, Usha Vance has a very different background from her husband. She also attended Yale as an undergraduate and received a masters degree from University of Cambridge. She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after law school and is currently a litigator. Mr Vance's name was long whispered about as a political candidate, and he saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, he got a kick-start via a $10m  (£7.7m) donation by his former boss, Silicon Valley power broker Peter Thiel. But the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected in increasingly Republican Ohio was his past criticism of Trump. He apologised for his previous remarks and managed to mend fences and earn Trump’s endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate. In the process, Mr Vance has become an increasingly important player in the world of Make America Great Again politics – and has signed up almost completely to Trump’s agenda.   In the Senate he has been a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine. Given his short tenure in the Democrat-led chamber, the bills he has sponsored have rarely moved forward, and have more often been about sending messages than changing policy. In recent months, Mr Vance introduced bills to withhold federal funds for colleges where there are encampments or protests against Israel's war in Gaza, and to colleges that employ undocumented immigrants. Mr Vance also sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government off from US capital markets if it does not follow international trade law. He hit all of these themes at a recent speech at the National Conservatism Conference, where he declared: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."" He said the idea of the American Dream – ""This very basic idea that you should be able to build a good life for yourself and your family in the country you call home"" - was ""under siege by the left"". And he said that American involvement in Ukraine had ""no obvious conclusion or even objective that we’re close to getting accomplished"". Also at the conference, he said the UK was ""not doing so good"" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country had become the “first truly Islamist country” with a nuclear bomb. Mr Vance, who was baptised as a Catholic in 2019, has expressed support in the past for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks. But he recently backed Trump's view that the matter was for states to decide. When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented his views. Mr Vance received waves of loud applause when he entered the convention arena in Milwaukee on Monday. He walked over to the Ohio contingent and, looking somewhat in awe of the scene, took selfies with delegates as he was being introduced. ""He's from humble beginnings and he's young,"" said delegate Amanda Suffecool, the party's chair in Portage County, in north-east Ohio. ""A lot of people are going to think he looks like him."" Mr Vance was also one of the first top Republicans to point the finger at Democrat campaign rhetoric in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally on Saturday. ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,"" he posted on X hours after the shooting. ""That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination."" In comments on Monday, President Biden called Mr Vance a ""clone of Trump"" - indicating how Democrats will attempt to portray him for the rest of the campaign.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-16 23:11:08,,True
467,"Biden tests positive for Covid, White House says","Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19 and is suffering mild symptoms, the White House has said. Karine Jean-Pierre, his press secretary, said the US president is vaccinated and boosted.  He has tested positive for Covid twice before.  Mr Biden, 81, was seen earlier on Wednesday visiting supporters in Las Vegas and speaking at an event. He has cancelled a campaign speech later in the night. The illness comes as he faces increasing pressure to step aside because of his age following a poor debate performance at the end of June.  Ms Jean-Pierre said the president planned to isolate at his home in Delaware while he carries out ""all of his duties fully during that time"".  The president's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, said Mr Biden presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and a cough and was given his first dose of Paxlovid.  He felt fine during his first event of the day, but later tested positive Dr O'Connor said. Reporters on the Las Vegas trip said they were rushed to the city's airport following the announcement. Mr Biden moved slowly and cautiously up the steps to the plane, video shows. He was not wearing a mask. The president was forced to cancel a speech at UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation. The organisation's chief executive Janet Murguría confirmed the diagnosis to the audience. ""Thank you all so much for your patience and understanding,"" she told the crowd.  ""Regrettably I was just on the phone with President Biden. And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon.

Nearly two dozen Democratic politicians have called for him to step aside in recent weeks, including Adam Schiff, a congressman from California,, who said today he had serious doubts about whether the president could beat former President Donald Trump.  He called on Mr Biden to  ""pass the torch"". Mr Schiff said that Mr Biden ""has been one of the most consequential presidents in our nation’s history"", and he could ""secure his legacy of leadership"" by allowing another Democrat to step forward.  In an interview with BET, which was due to be broadcast on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said he did not feel he could pass the mantle with the country so ""divided"".  The president also said, for the first time, that he would consider dropping out of the race if any of his doctors said he had a ""medical condition"".

476,An Olympic friendship that defied Hitler,"An Olympic friendship that defied Hitler It was an instinctive sporting gesture that has gone down in Olympic folklore, but, for German long-jump champion Luz Long, it would have dark consequences. As Jesse Owens soared over the eight-metre mark to secure gold at the 1936 Games, Long - his biggest rival - leapt into the sandpit in Berlin to hug and congratulate him. Later, in a striking contradiction to Nazi Germany's twisted notion of Aryan supremacy and decades before the civil rights movement would spark radical change in the United States, the pair shared a lap of honour together, black and white athlete jogging arm in arm. Not everyone was applauding. High in the stands, German leader Adolf Hitler watched on disapprovingly. As they stood on the podium - Long giving the required Nazi salute and Owens saluting the Stars and Stripes flag of a nation not yet ready to accept him wholly as one of their own - both athletes were unaware of what lay in store. German athletes who made it on to a podium at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin were required to offer the Nazi salute Owens and Long, both born in 1913, were at the peak of their athletic powers when they locked horns in Berlin.  But that is where the similarities ended; their beginnings and journeys to the Games were polar opposites. A 20th-century icon, Owens' story has been widely told. He was the grandson of former slaves and the youngest of 10 children in a family of Alabama tenant farmers. As a child, he picked cotton with the rest of his siblings, but his athletic ability became clear after the family moved to Cleveland and he was enrolled in school, aged nine. He had gone by the nickname JC, short for James Cleveland, but after his teacher misheard him he was registered as Jesse and the name stuck. Owens earned an athletic scholarship to attend Ohio State University where, under the tutelage of coach Larry Schnyder, he became one of the greatest sprinters the world has ever known. At a track and field meeting at the University of Michigan in 1935, Owens broke three world records and equalled another, all in the space of an hour, setting a new mark of 8.13m for the long jump that would stand for 25 years. Unlike his rival, Long enjoyed a privileged upbringing, born into a middle-class family in Leipzig. His father, Karl, owned a pharmacy in the centre of the city, while his mother, Johanna, was a qualified English teacher. She came from a respected academic family, which included scientist Justus von Liebig, known as the founder of organic chemistry. Carl Ludwig Hermann Long, who became known as Luz for short, grew up with his four siblings in the countryside outside the city. They would have family athletics championships in their sizeable back garden. Long joined Leipzig Sport Club in 1928, where he came under the guidance of coach Georg Richter, who helped him develop a technique of sailing through the air using his strength as a high-jumper, unlike Owens, who harnessed his pace as a sprinter. The partnership with Richter proved fruitful, as Long broke the German long jump record in 1933 to become national champion, aged just 20. Just a couple of months before the Berlin Olympics, Long set a new European long jump record of 7.82m en route to his third national title. Jesse Owens, left, and Luz Long, competing at the 1936 Olympics, adopted contrasting long jump styles  While both Owens and Long were building momentum on the track, they were also contending with the political landscape off it. In the United States, there was growing pressure to boycott the Berlin Games in light of stories about the treatment of Jewish people in Germany under the new Nazi regime. Owens initially supported calls for a boycott of the Games, reportedly telling the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People ""if there are any minorities in Germany who are being discriminated against, the United States should withdraw"". But he eventually agreed to attend following pleas from his coach and assurances from the United States Olympic Committee, who had sent a delegation to Germany to assess conditions and discuss the hosts' policy on the participation of Jewish athletes. Back in Germany, the political pressure placed on athletes by the state was increasing. ""Athletes were representatives of the German Reich - both on and off the ash track - not private individuals,"" says Julia Kellner-Long, Luz’s only grandchild. Long’s rise to the national team came in 1933 - the same year Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. In the unlikelihood that he was unaware what was expected of him, a banner posted at the training ground made it clear: ""Track and field athletes think of the 1936 Olympics. We must not disappoint our leader Adolf Hitler."" A banner over the German team's training ground reminded them of the political importance of the forthcoming Games. It read: 'Track and field athletes think of the 1936 Olympics. We must not disappoint our leader Adolf Hitler.' Hitler was present at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium as Owens and Long contested one of the Games' greatest long jump finals. After a see-sawing battle, Long matched Owens' leading distance of 7.87m with his penultimate attempt, to the delight of the home fans. But Owens dug out his best when he needed it most, responding with 7.94m, to move clear of Long once again. Long produced a foul on his final attempt, but his performance was good enough for silver and a first Olympic long jump medal for Germany. Owens, with his title already assured, created further history with a final leap of 8.06m - setting an Olympic record that would stand for 24 years. Long, putting aside his own disappointment, instinctively leapt into the sandpit to congratulate him.  Locked in that moment, alone in their embrace as an appreciative capacity crowd of more than 100,000 people watched on, Owens confided to his rival: ""You forced me to give my best."" Between them, Owens and Long had surpassed the previous Olympic record five times. ""It's almost like a fairytale - to jump so long in this weather,"" said Long in an interview with his hometown newspaper, Neue Leipziger Zeitung. ""I can't help it. I run to him. I'm the first to congratulate him, to hug him."" Long's impulsive reaction caught the attention of the German authorities. Soon after the Olympic Games, his mother, Johanna, made a note in her diary about a warning from Rudolf Hess, then deputy Fuhrer of the Nazi Party. Long, she wrote, had ""received an order from the highest authority"" that he should never again embrace a black person. He had been noted as ""not racially conscious"" by the Nazi regime. The embrace clearly angered the Nazis, who often used powerful imagery to further its own ideology and feared how Owens and Long's friendship might undermine its propaganda.  In that respect, they were right. Almost 90 years later, Owens and Long's friendship is one of the most enduring Olympic stories. ""The gesture of kindness and fairness touched the hearts of many people,"" says Kellner-Long. ""Together, Luz and Jesse enjoyed a special friendship that day, demonstrating to the world that in sports and in life, friendship and respect are the most important things, regardless of background or skin colour."" Stuart Rankin, Owens' only grandson, is equally struck by its significance. “I often say that of all my grandfather's accomplishments at the 1936 Olympics, the unlikely friendship that he struck with Luz Long is the thing of which I am most proud and most impressed by,” he says. ""For them to have forged that friendship, under those conditions, in those circumstances, in that stadium, in the face of Hitler, was just phenomenal."" Owens (right) credited Long (left) with helping him adjust his run-up after the American initially struggled in qualifying It would be the only time Owens and Long would compete against each other. Owens went on to add the 200m and 4x100m titles to his wins in the 100m and long jump and would take home four gold medals from the German capital. But he angered authorities by refusing to compete in a meeting in Sweden immediately after the Games, instead returning home to take advantage of his new-found fame and a clutch of commercial opportunities. The decision would result in Owens being banned from competing by the American Athletic Union - effectively ending his sporting career. Owens was still given a hero's welcome in a special homecoming ceremony in New York, but an incident at a party thrown in his honour at the Waldorf Astoria proved that despite his Olympic glory, nothing had changed. On arriving at the hotel, Owens was directed away from the lobby by a doorman to a side entrance he was told was for tradesmen and black people. It was a stark reminder of the deep-rooted division and racial prejudice at the heart of American society. Jesse Owens was given a hero's welcome on his return to America, but was asked to enter the Waldorf Astoria hotel using a separate entrance when attending a party thrown in his honour  Long left Berlin as Olympic silver-medallist, national champion and European long-jump record holder. He would go on to extend that mark to 7.90m the following year - a record that stood until 1956. But he could not escape scrutiny or suspicion. ""Luz's embrace in the sandpit had consequences,"" says Kellner-Long. ""He was placed under closer monitoring by the authorities, compelling him to tread more carefully and maintain a lower profile."" Luz Long enjoys a cuddle with his first son Kai in 1942, months before he was killed fighting for Germany during the Allied advance in Sicily  Long did not compete again after the outbreak of World War Two, instead focusing on his career as a lawyer. Heinrich, his youngest brother, was killed in action. Devastated by the loss, Long attempted to plot a course through the war for his own family. He married Gisela in 1941, and they had a son - Julia's father - in November of that year, naming him Kai Heinrich, after his lost brother. By then, Long had been drafted into the military, initially carrying out duties away from the frontline. However, in 1943 Long was shipped out to Sicily with the 10th Battery Parachute Anti-Aircraft Regiment. A month later, he would send his final letter home to Gisela, who, by this time, was heavily pregnant with their second son, Wolfgang Matthias. ""In the letter, Luz described camping in tents on a beautiful flower meadow surrounded by mountains, a peaceful setting - that was his final communication with his family,"" says Kellner-Long. ""The next day, 30 May 1943, Wolfgang was born. Unfortunately, Luz never got to meet him.” Allied forces landed in Sicily on 10 July 1943, as part of an operation to liberate Italy. Four days later, Long was hit in his leg by shrapnel, as German forces retreated, and bled to death. Gisela received notification on 30 July that her husband was missing in action, presumed dead. It was only after another seven years that the details were confirmed and his grave, in the German section of honour at the American military cemetery in Gela, was found. Owens (second from right) with Kai Long, Luz's son (second from left), on a 1951 visit to Germany  Owens chose not to enlist for military service during the war, and neither was he drafted. But, banned from official athletic competition and with commercial offers quickly drying up, he had to find unorthodox ways of supporting his family. He would take on local sprinters, giving them a 10 or 20-yard head start, before reeling them in with ease to claim a cash prize. Or, when his human rivals weren't forthcoming, Owens would race motorbikes, cars,  and horses. ""People say it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse,"" Owens said, ""but what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals."" Owens beats a horse and trap in a 100-yard race in 1948 in California  After flitting between menial jobs, things started to improve for Owens in the 1950s when he found employment as a motivational speaker. He started his own public relations business and became a sought-after figure, travelling around the globe as a sporting ambassador. During a trip to Germany in 1951, with the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team, Owens reached out to Long's family. He met Kai and took him to the Globetrotters game in Hamburg as his guest of honour. In 1964, Kai took part in a documentary, Jesse Owens Returns To Berlin, during which the two recreated a picture of Owens and Long reclining trackside at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Long's son Kai and Jesse Owens recreate an image from the 1936 Games at the city's Olympic Stadium in June 1964  ""Kai admired Jesse so much - his charisma, his modesty, and his natural gift and success as an athlete,"" says Kellner-Long. Owens was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1976, before his death from lung cancer four years later, aged 66.  He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1990. In 2016 then-president Barack Obama invited Owens' relatives to the White House for a reception that Jesse and the other black members of the 1936 US Olympic team had been denied after Berlin. , external His wife, Ruth, has continued his legacy, running the Jesse Owens Foundation before passing on the baton to their daughters - Gloria, Marlene and Beverly - and more recently their five grandchildren. Over the years, the Long and Owens families have stayed in touch.  Julia Kellner-Long, along with Owens' granddaughter Gina, lit the Olympic flame in a special ceremony at the Berlin Stadium in 2004. With Marlene, she then presented the long jump medals when the World Athletics Championships were held in Berlin in 2009. Kellner-Long and Rankin would become close friends after a chance meeting in Munich in 2012, and have recently worked together on a documentary about their grandparents. ""The relationship between the families means a lot to me, and I am proud of our connection,"" says Kellner-Long. ""Julia and I joke around often and think of both of our grandfathers looking down and smiling and being quite happy that the families are still connected despite the years,"" adds Rankin. Julia Kellner-Long (left) and Marlene Dortch (right) - granddaughters of Luz Long and Jesse Owens respectively - present long jump medals at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin While the reality of the friendship between Owens and Long is held dear by both families, their special bond has taken on a life of its own online. One widely repeated myth involves a vivid letter supposedly written by Long to Owens from the ""dry sand and wet blood"" of north Africa. It calls on Owens to return to Germany to find his son if Long fails to make it home. One of the lines reads: ""Tell him, Jesse, what times were like when we not separated by war, tell him how things can be between men on this earth."" Unbearably poignant, but almost certainly untrue. Long never served in north Africa. Neither family have seen such a letter and both question the likelihood and logistics of it being written and delivered. Kellner-Long understands the powerful message people continue to take from their story, however. ""It offers hope and inspiration to people worldwide,"" she says. ""In times when racism and exclusion are sadly still prevalent, this story is more relevant than ever."" ""I think that Luz's example of sportsmanship is one that should be preserved and held high for all time,"" says Rankin. ""My grandfather's relationship with Luz is certainly one he never would have predicted but, because it happened, it provided a hopeful perspective in my grandfather, and certainly in me, that, despite the tide of an entire nation, it doesn't mean every member of that nation is the same. ""Luz's strength and character, it's almost indescribable, but it demonstrates how in the most unlikeliest of places you can still find good.""

485,RFK apologises after private call with Trump leaked,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has apologised after a video was leaked of a private phone call in which Donald Trump is heard apparently trying to coax the independent presidential candidate to support him. “I would love you to do something,” Trump can be heard saying in the clip. “And I think it’ll be so good for you and so big for you. And we’re going to win.” Mr Kennedy then says: “Yeah.” Trump and Mr Kennedy, a longshot third-party candidate, are political rivals who have occasionally criticised each other during the campaign. The footage is said to have been recorded on Sunday, a day before the pair met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican convention is taking place, stoking speculation that Mr Kennedy might be about to exit the race and endorse Trump. But Kennedy spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said on Monday that he was not dropping out. Robert F Kennedy Jr posted on X on Tuesday: “When President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer. “I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted. I apologise to the president.” It was Kennedy’s son, Robert F Kennedy III, who posted the footage online early on Tuesday. The younger Kennedy said in the post on X, formerly Twitter, that he wanted to expose Trump’s “real opinion” on immunisations, but he swiftly deleted the clip. Trump can also be heard in the video discussing discredited claims about the health risks of childhood vaccines, a longstanding concern for Mr Kennedy, but one which the scientific community has said is misinformation. “I agree with you, man. Something's wrong with that whole system, and it's the doctors you find,"" Trump can be heard saying. Also on Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr, the former president’s son, was asked about rumours that Mr Kennedy could join forces with the Republican presidential nominee. Speaking at an event in Milwaukee, he said “maybe there’s a great place for him somewhere in an administration”. Mr Trump Jr said he didn’t have any “inside scoop on that, certainly not now”, but he would “love to see that happen”. Opinion polls suggest that Mr Kennedy could draw votes equally from Trump and the Democratic President Joe Biden, including in swing states, in this November's election.",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134p2k24nzo,"Jude Sheerin,",2024-07-17 01:11:10,,True
490,Yoro set for Man Utd medical before £52m move,"Leny Yoro made his Lille debut at the age of 16 Manchester United are closing in on signing Lille defender Leny Yoro. Sources say United have agreed a 62m-euro (£52.06m) fee for Yoro, who is due to fly to Manchester today for a medical. The 18-year-old has attracted significant interest from a number of top European clubs, with Real Madrid repeatedly mentioned as one of the sides keen to sign the player. Yoro, who made his Lille debut at the age of 16, was picked in Thierry Henry’s provisional France squad for the Olympic Games but was omitted from the final party due to Lille's participation in the Champions League qualification rounds.  His arrival would bring some clarity to United’s central defensive group. The club have lodged two bids with Everton for Jarrad Branthwaite but both have been rejected by the Merseyside club as they fall well short of their valuation, which sources have said is in excess of £75m. United have also been negotiating with Bayern Munich for their Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt. Sources say while the club remain interested in Branthwaite and De Ligt, they would not sign both and further signings are likely to depend on squad space and available funds. Raphael Varane left the club at the end of the season and there are doubts over the future of Sweden’s Victor Lindelof, whose contract expires next year. Harry Maguire was the subject of bids from rival Premier League clubs last summer but opted to remain at Old Trafford and eventually made 22 Premier League appearances. Joshua Zirkzee, 23, became the club's first signing of the summer last week when he arrived in a £36.5m deal from Italian side Bologna. United have agreed a £27m fee with French club Marseille for striker Mason Greenwood, while defender Willy Kambwala left United to join La Liga outfit Villarreal last week for a fee of around £9m.

506,UFC boss to promote Trump's 'fighter' image at RNC finale,"The president of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) will take the stage on Thursday night before Donald Trump - days after an assassination attempt - officially accepts the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has embraced Dana White, one of his most outspoken supporters outside of politics, and the hugely popular combat sports franchise he manages, gracing several of its live events over the past year while grappling with court battles. With an unfiltered and unorthodox style similar to Trump's, the UFC boss will now act as frontman, introducing his long-time friend as the finale of the Republican National Convention. Their friendship dates back to at least 2001. Back then, Mr White - an Irish-American college dropout turned boxercise instructor - had gone from managing two mixed martial arts (MMA) champions to becoming UFC president. MMA had been facing a downturn. After then-US Senator John McCain labelled it ""human cockfighting"" and led a campaign to ban the UFC, its events were consigned to small markets. ""This brand was so bad, venues didn't even want us. Arenas didn't want us,"" Mr White said in 2022. But after New Jersey legalised the sport in 2000, he continued, ""Trump literally called us. He said 'Come to my place, do the event here. We'll have you at the Trump Taj Mahal'."" The now-defunct casino and hotel in Atlantic City went on to host the UFC 31 and UFC 32 MMA events, with Trump showing up for the first fight and staying until the last on both occasions, according to Mr White. Both events boosted the company's profile and helped it secure larger venues for future events. Now the largest MMA promotion in the world, the UFC is currently valued at $12.3bn (£9.5bn). And Mr White has stayed loyal to Trump through his evolution from business to politics. Stumping for his friend at the RNC in 2016, he praised him in a short but fiery speech as ""a hard worker"" with ""great business instincts"". ""I know fighters,"" he said. ""Donald Trump is a fighter, and I know he will fight for this country.” Endorsing him again at the 2020 RNC, he championed Trump's record in office and said it was ""critically important to re-elect"" him. Brash and uncensored in both language and manner, the UFC chief has said he ""does not give a [expletive]"" about mixing business and politics. No stranger to controversy himself, he admitted last year to slapping his wife after a drunken altercation at a New Year's Eve party was caught on video. He has since apologised. As Trump faced criminal, civil and other legal challenges in his post-presidency, he has been Mr White's guest at multiple special events. In the past year, Trump has attended at least four such events, often making fighter-style entrances with background music and an entourage. His last scheduled appearance was scuttled this past Saturday by the attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally. The UFC is replete with fighters who speak out in support of traditionally conservative values, including several self-described ""pro-American patriots"".  Although it includes female fighters, the sport represents a hyper-masculinity that is arguably a good fit for the image generated by the Trump campaign. Each time Trump has been received with thunderous ovations from clearly partisan crowds and taken VIP seats close to the octagon, or main fighting ring. But he likely cannot replicate this growing love affair in other sports arenas, including those with Trump friendly audiences like Nascar and the PGA Tour, and the previously Trump-friendly WWE. The failed assassination attempt on Trump has meanwhile reinforced his friend's support for his re-election. ""Everybody wants to act like the tough guy. But when the [expletive] goes down, you find out who the tough guys are and who the tough guys are not,"" Mr White told The Pat McAfee Show this week. ""This guy is the legitimate, ultimate, American badass of all time."" Media reports indicate that Trump has rewritten Thursday's nomination speech following Saturday's shooting to make an explicit call for unity. But if Mr White's previous convention speeches are any indication, his introduction to the main event may not strike the same conciliatory tone. The convention will also hear from controversial pro-wrestling legend Hulk Hogan. And, as one Trump surrogate put it, the former president's walk onto the stage is going to be like ""Hogan at Wrestlemania"".",2024-07-18 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng948r84go,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-18 19:10:07,,True
505,Trump gunman flagged by Secret Service 20 minutes before shooting,"A counter sniper flagged a suspicious man using a rangefinder to the US Secret Service some 20 minutes before a gunman opened fire at a Donald Trump rally, according to members of Congress briefed by law enforcement.  A clearer timeline of the events leading up to the assassination attempt has begun to emerge after closed briefings to lawmakers on Wednesday.  Local police had initially spotted the gunman, who was acting strangely, at Saturday's Pennsylvania rally about an hour before the shooting, according to the briefings.  They lost him in the crowd before he was spotted again by the counter sniper. The new information has raised more questions about why Trump's would-be assassin was not stopped sooner and why the former president was allowed to appear on the rally stage.  Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old suspected gunman, was reportedly spotted early by local police, who flagged him as a skinny young man who was behaving in a suspicious manner.  They notified other police agencies, including the Secret Service, via radio. At the time, Crooks did not appear to have a weapon. They then lost track of him.  “He was identified as a character of suspicion because [he had] a rangefinder as well as a backpack. And this was over an hour before the shooting actually occurred,” Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, who was present at the briefings, told Fox News. “So, you would think over the course of that hour, you shouldn’t lose sight of the individual.” Later, around 17:45 local time, Crooks was spotted again, this time by a counter sniper officer around the Agr International building - the one the gunman later scaled up to aim at Trump.  The officer reportedly took a picture of the gunman looking through the rangefinder, according to  CBS News, the BBC's news partner, and immediately radioed to a command post to report the sighting. By 17:52 - 19 minutes before the shooting - the Secret Service was made aware that Crooks was spotted with a rangefinder, and disseminated that information to other officers on site, CBS reported. A rangefinder is an instrument that can be used to help measure the distance to a target.  It was also revealed during the briefings that the gunman had visited the site of the attack, the Butler County fairgrounds, at least once in the days before the assassination attempt and had previously searched on his phone for symptoms of a depressive disorder, an official familiar with the briefing told CBS. The attacker had also used his phone to search for images of both Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. FBI Director Wray told lawmakers on the call that more than 200 interviews had already been conducted and 14,000 images reviewed. Crooks fired at Trump shortly after he began speaking at the rally at 18:11. One rallygoer was killed in the shooting and two others were injured. Trump was wounded in the ear.  Crooks was killed by Secret Service snipers within 26 seconds of opening fire. In the briefing with law enforcement agencies, multiple Republican senators criticised the lack of transparency from investigators and expressed outrage that Trump was allowed to take the stage even after a threat was identified. ""I am appalled to learn that the Secret Service knew about a threat prior to President Trump walking on stage,"" tweeted Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Some senators who participated in the call demanded the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle. ""The egregious security failures and lack of transparency around the assassination attempt on President Trump demand an immediate change of leadership at the Secret Service,"" tweeted Utah Senator Mike Lee. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after the call that ""the nation deserves answers and accountability"" and a change in leadership at Secret Service would be ""an important step in that direction"". House lawmakers similarly were briefed on Wednesday by law enforcement about security and what led up to the Saturday shooting.  Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also called for Ms Cheatle to quit. He said he plans to open an investigation in the House. ""It'll be comprised of Republicans and Democrats to get down to the bottom of this quickly, so the American people can get the answers that they deserve,"" he told Fox News. FBI Director Chris Wray, who participated in the calls, told lawmakers that no motive has yet been identified for the gunman. Ms Cheatle, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service, is due to testify next week to the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee and House Homeland Security Committee. She also gave a private, in-person briefing on Tuesday to Trump in Milwaukee regarding the assassination attempt, CBS reported, citing a person familiar with the meeting.  Ms Cheatle had previously said that the agency relied on local police to secure the building where the gunman climbed to the roof with his firearm. Local law enforcement, however, had told Secret Service that they did not have enough resources to secure that building, according to Richard Goldinger, the district attorney in Butler County, where the rally took place.  A local officer did come face-to-face with the gunman on the roof moments before the attack, Butler Township Manager Tom Knights told CBS.  The officer was searching after reports about a suspicious person. He was hoisted on to the roof by another officer and saw the suspect pointing a weapon directly at him, Mr Knights said.  The officer was in a ""defenceless"" position and let go, falling to the ground. He then alerted others to the gunman. Moments later, the shooting started.  Jason Russell, a former Secret Service agent who has worked at campaigned rallies, said the disaster at last week’s rally likely resulted from a miscommunication about different officials’ responsibilities. “It seems to me like there was just a miscommunication, but the reality is, if it's a Secret Service event, anything that happens is our fault,"" he told the BBC. Mr Russell added he would have at least placed an obstacle between the building from where the gunman fired and where Trump was delivering his speech to block the line of sight. The attack is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, and President Biden said he would direct an independent review be opened.",2024-07-18 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51ydg792ggo,"Max Matza and Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-18 18:10:07,,True
504,Seething anger at Secret Service in town where Trump was shot at,"You don't expect to meet an anti-Trump Republican at a Trump rally. When 67-year-old US Army veteran Thomas Gleason arrived at former President Donald Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, he came looking for conversation.  A registered Republican who is opposed to Trump, Mr Gleason was wearing a placard proclaiming the former president a ""threat to the Constitution"" and challenging the former president's supporters to a friendly debate. ""I had very civil discussions with a lot of people,"" he recalled, ""that was a pleasant surprise"". Soon after, however, the jovial atmosphere of the rally turned to chaos, confusion and rage as shots rang out from a nearby rooftop.  ""I immediately knew what it was. I recognised it as gunfire,"" the former paratrooper told the BBC several days after the shooting. ""Some people screamed, and a lot of people fell to the ground."" The shooting grazed Trump's ear and 50-year-old volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore was left dead. Two others were seriously injured. In the days after the shooting, rallygoers who were in attendance say that their initial feelings of shock have given way to anger, sadness, and fears for what the future may bring.  Many of those who attended the rally have directed their anger at the US Secret Service, which they see as having been responsible for security at the event - and, by extension, their own safety. The Secret Service has said that local police were responsible for the outer cordons of security at the rally and had officers inside the building from where he was shooting. But that does little to soothe the concerns of witnesses such as 66-year-old Kathleen O' Shea, who laid the blame explicitly on the Secret Service's embattled director, Kimberly Cheatle.  Two days after the shooting, Ms O'Shea told the BBC she was ""furious"" that an ""epic failure"" left a man dead and Trump - who she says she would ""take a bullet for"" - with a narrow escape. ""All I want to hear from her [Ms Cheatle] is that she resigns. She got a good, innocent American killed,"" she added. ""She should offer her heartfelt condolences and apologies, and if she means it, she will resign.""   Jean Vincent, a Butler woman who attended the rally alongside her sister Suzanne, said that - no matter who was responsible for what part of security - the Secret Service ""definitely dropped the ball""  on 13 July.  ""I get so emotional. I'm so upset someone could have killed us. Could have killed my children,"" she said, adding that her son shielded her body during the shooting. ""Someone has to be held responsible. They've got to learn."" Ms Vincent said that when she heard the shooting her thoughts immediately went to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, when dozens of people were killed by a gunman firing from the roof of a hotel.  ""There could have been 200, 300 people killed,"" she said. ""It's surreal. Nobody who was there can understand the security breach.""  Former Marine Teresa Wilson - an employee of a local police department elsewhere in Pennsylvania - was at the rally with a group of family members, including her elderly mother and teenage nephew.  She said she remains ""infuriated"" by a security set-up that she said left them ""like sitting ducks"". ""It was a huge and embarrassing failure on their part,"" she said. ""It took two days for me to feel normal again. I was plagued by anxiety over the what-ifs.""  ""Once I heard... early on about explosives being present, I struggled to shake the feeling of insecurity even though I was home and away from danger,"" she added.  ""My heart goes out to the families of the victims. If I had such a difficult time, I can't imagine what they are going through.""  Residents of Butler and its surrounding county describe the largely rural area as friendly and neighbourly, a quiet place. The kind of town in which people know and help each other despite political differences.  Now, some residents fear that their town will forever be known for the events of 13 July.  Among them are partly retired psychiatrist Warren Goodrich and his wife Debbie.  The BBC first encountered them at the site of the rally, where they stood near Trump when he spoke. When the shooting began, they took cover near a young girl who was pleading for her life, a sight that Mrs Goodrich said broke her heart.  ""It's been really hard on us emotionally,"" Mrs Goodrich remarked a few days later. ""It really hurts. It's starting to hit us.... I'm just glad we're alive.""  Over the course of more than 20 years in the town, the Goodrichs say they often tell people elsewhere that they are from Pittsburgh, knowing that few people will know where it is.  Looking to the future, Mr Goodrich said he is worried that Butler will have earned international notoriety and become a ""shunned city"".  ""It's such a significant piece of history. But it's irrational to blame the whole city,"" he said. ""It's very, very sad.""  Echoing a sentiment heard several times by the BBC in Butler, Suzanne Vincent, Jean's sister, said that she believes the town will ""unfortunately be on the map"" at a national level, comparing it to small towns like Uvalde, Texas, which have been marked by tragedies. ""That is so unfair,"" she added. ""But it's changed this community, and it's changed America.""  For now, the motive for the shooting remains unclear, and there has been so far no evidence that proves or even suggests that suspect Matthew Thomas Crooks was motivated by politics. But some of those who witnessed the bloodshed in Butler said they feared that the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate could raise tensions and push people to extremes.  ""It's not just violence against people like Trump and Biden that I'm concerned about,"" said Mr Gleason, the army veteran. ""I'm also worried about violence against people who hold opposing views.""  Jean Vincent said that she believes the US has entered a ""very, very scary"" time in which tensions are running particularly high ahead of the November election.  ""I fear that this country is sliding into chaos and is out of control. I just can't believe everyone is acting so crazy,"" she said. ""There's all this division. What happens in the upcoming election if people are not happy with the outcome?""  Others described the aftermath of the shooting with a feeling of disgust.  ""It's unacceptable, anywhere,"" said Greg Smith, whose business is immediately adjacent to the rally area, hours after it took place.   ""I don't care what candidate you like, or what your philosophy is.  ""No matter the political climate... there is no room for this, anywhere.""

498,Trump to address buoyant Republicans in first speech since shooting,"Donald Trump will address a celebratory Republican convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, where he is expected to formally accept the presidential nomination and bring to a close a four-day event that has underscored his total dominance of the party. The former president, 78, will deliver his primetime speech while riding a wave of momentum that has grown since Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance last month and some more recent court rulings in his favour. It is also his first speech since he survived an assassination attempt at a rally on Saturday, which left him bloodied after a gunman shot in his direction as he delivered remarks on an outdoor stage. Lara Trump told the BBC's US news partner CBS that her father-in-law was affected by his ""near death experience"" and that will be reflected in his address. She said Americans may see a ""different version"" of him on Thursday. The convention in Wisconsin has been a family affair for the Trumps, with Lara Trump among the broad mix of relatives to have spoken or appeared in the arena's VIP box. The messaging has been consistent, with an apparent campaign effort to present a softer Trump with repeated anecdotes presenting him as a family man and unifying figure. That has not gone unnoticed by critics, with some senior Democrats pushing back on this message. “In recent days, they’ve been trying to portray themselves as the party of unity,"" Vice-President Kamala Harris said of the convention on Thursday. “You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity and dignity,"" she said. After he takes the stage on Thursday night, the former president will share his vision to ""usher in a new golden age for America"", according to the party.  It will cap off a week of speeches from Republican politicians, including Trump's former primary rivals, delegates and governors.  Trump told the Washington Examiner newspaper on Sunday that he decided to rewrite his speech in the wake of the assassination attempt, switching from attacks on President Joe Biden's policies to a message of unity. ""It’s going to be a whole different speech now,"" he said.  “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he added.  One rally attendee was killed in the Saturday shooting and two were badly injured. Trump was shot in the ear.  He has received repeated praise from Republican attendees this week, including some who greeted in the him in the convention centre with tears in their eyes, and others wearing fake ear bandages to express solidarity after the shooting. A unity message from Trump would be a departure from the strong rhetoric he's often used on the campaign trail, where he has railed against ""communists, Marxist, fascists and the radical left thugs"".  Even with this altered message, he is still likely, as his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance did on Wednesday night, to criticise President Biden and his record. Mr Vance assailed “career politicians” like Mr Biden in his speech.  Several other high-profile names are expected to take the stage on Thursday, including Eric Trump, the former president's son, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump will be introduced by his friend, Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Wrestler Hulk Hogan will also speak ahead of Trump formally accepting his third consecutive Republican nomination. Trump's wife Melania and daughter Ivanka are also set to appear at the convention for the first time. The evening session of the convention is expected to begin at around 17:45 CST (23:45 BST), with Trump’s speech lasting until potentially 22:30 CST.  President Biden, meanwhile, has had to pause campaign stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, after testing positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. He is experiencing mild symptoms, the White House said.  Mr Biden is under increasing pressure to step aside after reports emerged on Wednesday that both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries privately urged him to end his re-election campaign.  Polls indicate Mr Biden is trailing the former president in several crucial swing states.

515,The young stars to follow at the Paris Olympics,"In the build-up to the opening of the 30th summer Olympics on Friday, 26 July, BBC Sport takes a look at the rising stars and future champions set to shine in the French capital. At the age of 17, Phoebe Gill is set to become the youngest British track athlete to compete at an Olympic Games for more than 40 years. The 800m sensation beat Jemma Reekie, who finished fourth at Tokyo 2020, to win her first British title in June and confirm her Olympic debut. Gill broke the European under-18 800m record by clocking one minute 57.86 seconds two weeks after her 17th birthday in May and will now seek to emulate team-mate Keely Hodgkinson by winning a medal as a teenager at her first Games. Record-breaking 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is ready to make a splash at her second Olympics. The Canadian is the world record holder in the 400m individual medley and second-fastest woman in history in both the 400m and 800m freestyle, and ended three-time defending Olympic champion Katie Ledecky's 13-year unbeaten streak in the 800m freestyle in February. In Paris she will contest the 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley - she is a two-time world champion in both - along with the 200m individual medley, 400m freestyle and probably several relay events. Lola Tambling will join fellow teenager Sky Brown - who became Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist by winning park bronze aged 13 in 2021 - in the skateboarding at Paris 2024. Tambling's journey to the Games began when she was just seven years old - inspired after her parents opened a skatepark in Saltash, Cornwall. Lola: Teenage Olympic 'hero in a halfpipe' The 16-year-old finished sixth at last year's World Championships, proving she is ready to be a contender when she makes her Olympic debut at the Place de La Concorde. Toby Roberts was the first British man to qualify for Olympic climbing, and the 19-year-old will be joined by Hamish McArthur, 23, in making history in Paris. Roberts, who made his first recorded climb at just three years old, clinched his first lead World Cup title at the Chamonix World Cup in July last year - three weeks after winning his first Word Cup title with Bouldering gold in Italy. That made Roberts the first British climber to triumph in two different World Cup disciplines before his first Olympics, where Erin McNeice, 20, and Molly Thompson-Smith, 26, complete GB's climbing squad. Quincy Wilson is the youngest man in history to be selected to represent Team USA in track and field, aged just 16. The American broke an under-18 world record in the 400m that had stood for 42 years when he clocked 44.66 seconds in the heats at the US trials in June, reducing that to 44.59 in the semi-finals two days later. He was named on the USA's 4x400m relay squad for Paris after finishing sixth in the final in 44.94secs - a third successive sub-45 run - to make US history. Twelve years after being inspired to try archery after watching the film 'Brave', 19-year-old Penny Healey will make her Olympic debut. Healey will compete in the women's individual and team events in Paris after helping GB win bronze at the final Olympic qualifying event in Antalya in June. She was shortlisted for BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year following a 2023 season in which she claimed two European golds, and already this year she has won European Grand Prix gold on home soil and her first individual World Cup title. Anna Hursey began playing table tennis at the age of five, first represented her country aged 10, and in Paris will become an Olympian at 18 years old. Born in Wales, Hursey moved to China - where her mother is from - to train full-time in 2019. Three years later, she won women's doubles bronze at the Commonwealth Games. Not only a soon-to-be Olympic athlete, Hursey hopes to help save the planet as a United Nations Young Champion on climate change - a role she accepted when she was 13. Despite being just 17, this will be Quan Hongchan's second Games - and the Chinese diver will start as the defending champion in the women's 10m platform. Then 14, Quan set a world record in Tokyo to beat 15-year-old team-mate Chen Yuxi to gold, earning perfect scores from all seven judges on two of her five dives. China have won all but one of the diving golds at both the past two Olympics and Quan will once again be favourite after collecting five World Championship golds since winning the Olympic title. Emma Finucane heads to Paris as a world and European champion and has been compared to former British cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who won two Olympic golds and six world sprint titles. The Welsh 21-year-old, who started cycling at eight years old, was crowned Britain’s first world women's sprint champion for a decade in Glasgow last year, before becoming Britain's first female European sprint champion in Apeldoorn in January. Finucane follows Becky James and Pendleton as only the third British woman to win world sprint gold, which came after she recorded the fastest-ever 200m by a woman at sea level en route to the final. Artistic gymnast Abigail Martin has only just completed her GCSEs and won't know her results when she competes at her first Olympic Games. The 16-year-old will be GB’s youngest gymnast in Paris but she already boasts a European silver medal as part of the British women's team at this year's championships in Rimini. In her first year as a senior, Martin has won three medals at the British Championships and clinched floor bronze at the 2024 Osijek World Cup to make the grade as a member of Team GB.",2024-07-18 23:10:08,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cye0815j831o,Harry Poole,2024-07-18 23:10:08,,True
527,Nadal continues Olympic preparations with win against Norrie,"Rafael Nadal is a two-time Olympic gold medallist Rafael Nadal's preparations for the Olympics continued with an impressive straight-set win over Britain's Cameron Norrie in the second round of the Swedish Open. Nadal, 38, overcame the fifth seed in Bastad 6-4 6-4 to set up a quarter-final with Argentine Mariono Navone. The Spaniard decided to miss Wimbledon to focus on the Olympics in Paris this summer - where he will play singles and doubles with Carlos Alcaraz. Nadal, who is set to play in the doubles semi-final with Casper Ruud on Saturday, broke Norrie once in the first set to claim the lead. After receiving medical treatment on his arm because of a heavy fall at the start of the second set, Nadal was broken by an improving Norrie. But Nadal, who was trailing 4-1, then reeled off five games in a row to book his spot in the last eight with his best performance of the season. ""Great feelings, it's been a while without playing on the Tour since Roland Garros and I had a chance to compete against a great player like Cameron,"" said Nadal.  ""It's part of the journey today. I haven't been competing very often so matches like today help and holding the pressure on the opponent for the whole game is something I need to improve on because I haven't played enough.""",2024-07-18 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cglkep7xj3go,Charlotte Coates,2024-07-18 16:10:10,,True
528,Biden vows to run as more Democrats ask him to drop out,"US President Joe Biden is looking forward to ""getting back on the campaign trail next week"", fortifying his commitment to stick in the race as more Democrats on Friday called for him to step aside as the party nominee.   “The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win,"" he said. His statement appeared to be in response to the conflicting reports that Mr Biden's inner circle is discussing the beleaguered president's future and whether he will remain in the race.  Over the last several weeks, Mr Biden has been caught in a whirlwind of political pressure to step down: Calls from leaders within his own party to withdraw from the race, a loss of big-ticket donors and the added pressure that his decision could cost Democrats control of Congress.  At least a dozen Democratic lawmakers have called for him to step aside on Friday alone, and Vice-President Kamala Harris - considered the top choice to replace Mr Biden - was tasked with comforting worried donors on a Friday afternoon call.  Ms Harris said that she believed ""in my heart of hearts"" that ""we are going to win this election"", an individual who listened to the conversation told the BBC.  ""We know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: Our president, Joe Biden,"" she added. Earlier in the day, Mr Biden’s re-election campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon also attempted to push back on speculation that the president would withdraw in an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe “Absolutely, the president’s in this race,” she said when asked about Mr Biden's plans.  She described him as ""more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump"" and said he's the ""best person"" to take on the former president. In his statement, the president referenced former President Trump's Republican National Convention speech to say he will continue ""exposing the threat"" of the former president while ""making the case"" for his record.  ""Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,"" he said.  As the conflict played on on Friday, the president was under quarantine at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He tested positive for Covid-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week. Mr Biden is experiencing “mild symptoms”, the White House said.  Since his poor debate performance last month, Mr Biden has insisted he will continue to run, though his perspective on what it would take for him to step down as the Democratic nominee has evolved.  First telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos ""only the Lord Almighty"" would make him stand down, Mr Biden said this week during an interview with BET (Black Entertainment Television) that he would re-evaluate the campaign if a doctor told him he had a serious medical condition.  According to a campaign memo released on Friday, Mr Biden isn't going anywhere.  ""Joe Biden has made it more than clear: He’s in this race and he’s in it to win it,"" according to the memo. ""Moreover, he’s the presumptive nominee — there is no plan for an alternative nominee. In a few short weeks, Joe Biden will be the official nominee. It is high past time we stop fighting one another. The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump."" Time is running out for Mr Biden to decide if he will step down. The Democratic National Convention begins 19 August, but the Democratic National Committee is expected to meet virtually the first week of August to nominate Biden as the official party nominee to meet state ballot deadlines.  The DNC rules committee met on Friday morning to discuss the procedures for the virtual roll-call vote, which they intend to hold before 7 August.  When asked whether another candidate could challenge Mr Biden in the roll-call vote, the committee's co-chair Leah Daughtry said that ""any challenger would have to have the verified support of hundreds of delegates"". With Mr Biden winning nearly all of the available delegates during the Democratic primary, that requirement would be nearly insurmountable.  Ms Daughtry noted that ""such a challenge has never happened over the past half century of competitive primaries"". The pressure continues to build, however. On Friday, Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, of New Mexico, became the third Democrat in the upper chamber to call for Biden to step aside. ""By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to united behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,"" he wrote in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.  His statement follows that of Democratic Senator Jon Tester, of Montana, who called on Biden to end his re-election bid on Thursday.  ""While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,"" Mr Tester wrote in a statement on X. In the House, Congressman Jim Costa, a Democrat from California, also called for him to withdraw on Thursday.  Democratic congressmen Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin released a joint message on Friday saying ""the most responsible and patriotic thing"" Biden could do is ""step aside as our nominee"".  ""With great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,"" they wrote in the joint statement.  Illinois Democratic congressman Sean Casten wrote in the Chicago Tribune on Friday that he doesn't think the president can defeat former US President Donald Trump.  ""It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,"" he wrote.  Other members of the House joined the calls for the president to step aside on Friday, including Zoe Lofgren of California, Kathy Castor of Florida, Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky, Greg Landsman of Ohio and Betty McCollum of Minnesota. Reports this week suggested senior Democratic leaders are leaning in the same direction.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns during private conversations with Mr Biden about his candidacy. In public statements, Ms Pelosi's staff insisted her comments have been misrepresented and Mr Jeffries affirmed his support for Mr Biden. Former President Barack Obama, Mr Biden's previous running mate, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished. Lawmakers haven't been the only ones turning their backs to Biden. Big name donors - including actor George Clooney and Disney family heiress Abigail Disney - have closed their wallets.   Despite the defectors, some are sticking by his side.  New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most influential progressive voices in the House, has supported Biden over the last few weeks. She broadcast live on Instagram on Friday morning and spoke about the risks of entering the convention without Biden as the presumptive nominee, including potential legal challenges and ballot access deadlines.  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, have both met with the president and also indicated their support for his re-election bid.

542,Republicans put abortion disagreements aside at 'unity' convention,"Edna Wales, a Republican delegate from Florida, does not support abortion. As a Roman Catholic, the procedure goes against her moral values. But her policy position, she told the BBC at a street fair at the Republican National Convention, was that it should be left to the states. “I truly feel that,” she said. Given that outlawing abortion nationwide has been an animating issue for religious Republicans for decades, it was a surprising position to hear at this weeklong gathering.  Yet Ms Wales’ stance is the same one that Donald Trump, the party’s nominee for president, now espouses. The former president has boasted of appointing a US Supreme Court bench that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. The 2022 decision upended the landscape of abortion access in the US, with some Republican-led states swiftly outlawing or restricting the procedure while other Democratic-controlled states took steps to protect access. After months of back and forth, Trump has made something of a public retreat from the issue, saying abortion should now be left to the states. While the party appears in lockstep with their nominee - a key theme of this week’s convention has been “unity” – under the surface, some daylight has emerged between Trump’s Republican Party and the most ardent members of the anti-abortion movement who want to see the procedure ended nationally. “I think where, potentially, President Trump currently is, and the pro-life movement is, it could be a schism,” said Marc Short, who was chief-of-staff to former vice-president Mike Pence – one of the party’s staunchest anti-abortion politicians. Trump’s position may well be a political calculation, given polls suggest the majority of Americans support abortion access. The end of Roe v Wade has also given Democrats a potent political issue to campaign on: protecting access. They performed better than expected during the 2022 midterm elections, and many pollsters and pundits credited the abortion issue for this. Trump’s supporters at the convention in Milwaukee told the BBC they appreciated the pragmatism at play. “I understand how he has to be so careful of how he handles [abortion] because of his run for president,” Ms Wales said. She said she believed pressure from the right on Trump was unfair, because “a lot of people are against abortion. You know, a lot of people are for abortion, and that is a very touchy subject”. Internal tensions over the issue spilled into the open with the release of the 2024 Republican Party platform, which outlines its policies and positions on various key issues. Its abortion section in 2016, and again in 2020, promised to appoint anti-abortion judges, to axe federal funding for Planned Parenthood and called for a “human life amendment” to be added to the Constitution. This year, the abortion section underwent a heavy edit. It cut the abortion section from 775 words to 90. The four-sentence pledge promises to stand for life and oppose “late-term abortion”. It also states the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution “guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights”. It then adds: “Because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.” Republicans in Milwaukee expressed little issue with the new language and fell in line behind their nominee. “I agree it has to be up to the states,” said Maria Rodriguez of Georgia, who described herself as a “pro-life Christian” who switched to the Republican Party due to its opposition to abortion. “I just don't feel like it's something that should be done nationally,” said Jackie Canon, a delegate from Louisiana. “I feel like it should be done state by state.” But the changes also inspired some anger. Mr Short told the BBC religious conservatives were “disappointed” by the platform position on abortion, and some had viewed the end of Roe v Wade as a “first step”. His former boss, Mike Pence, was one of them, calling the platform a “profound disappointment” that removed “historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform”. “They rolled us,” Gail Ruzicka, who was on the RNC platform committee, told WISN Milwaukee. “I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language.” At a glance, the 2024 abortion platform seemed to reflect Trump's new, more moderate stance that puts the onus on the states. Those paying close attention saw something different. “This particular platform is not going to win any prizes for eloquence,” said Kristi Hamrick, vice-president of policy for Students for Life, one of the largest anti-abortion organisations in the country. But, she said, the platform gave us “what we asked for”. “The 14th Amendment is the legal foundation upon which we need to build a new, more pro-life America,” she said. “That’s a win.” The 14th Amendment has, for years, been raised by anti-abortion activists to claim that foetuses should be granted the same rights as other Americans. In this thinking, a federal abortion ban already exists within the constitution, and no new amendment or law is needed. “Invoking the 14th Amendment to protect ‘every life’ is clearly a call to foetal personhood,” Rachel Rebouché, dean and law professor at Temple University Law school, and a leading scholar in reproductive health law. “That’s got to be the end game.” In other words, what looked like a softening of language on abortion could in fact be read as a possible pathway to outlawing it nationwide. Most national leaders in the anti-abortion movement joined Ms Hamrick in applauding the platform. Marjorie Dannenfelser of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, John Mize of Americans United for Life and Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition all signed a letter pledging their support for the platform. Experts say any confusion was likely intentional, a marker of a party juggling a socially conservative base, while also working to appeal to moderate voters who largely support abortion access. “In reality there are these two mutually incompatible constituencies that the GOP is trying to appeal to on abortion,” said Mary Ziegler, a historian and law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a leading expert on the abortion debate. “I think the platform was designed to placate all these people… and you can’t really do that by being clear,” she said. “I think confusion is the best strategy that’s emerged.” Even sceptical Republicans here in Milwaukee are falling in line behind Trump on abortion, a sign of the grip he holds on the Republican Party. Former US Senator Rick Santorum, a prominent anti-abortion politician, told the BBC on the convention floor that he was “obviously disappointed” in the new party platform “but Donald Trump is a strong pro-life president”. He anticipated there may be more arguments over abortion in the party in the years to come, but with Trump about to be crowned the nominee, he said now was not the time. “I’m not sure it’s much of a battle right now,” he said.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3nz67v9lo,"Kayla Epstein and Holly Honderich,",2024-07-19 03:10:21,,True
537,Who is Kamala Harris? The VP's star is rising among Democrats,"Less than four months out from the election, Vice-President Kamala Harris has found herself in a difficult position.  President Joe Biden's poor performance on the debate stage spurred mounting criticism about his ability to win the election. As anxiety has turned to tension within the Democratic party, one name has risen to the top of the list of possible replacement candidates: hers. Four years ago, the one-time candidate for the Democratic nomination would have welcomed the party's praises. But now she receives it from a different and perhaps more precarious position as part of an embattled incumbent ticket. How strongly should she go to bat for her running mate, knowing her chances of another term hang in the balance?  In the 24 hours after the debate debacle, Ms Harris chose strong loyalty to Mr Biden. The vice-president spoke on CNN, MSNBC and at a campaign rally. She defended her political partner's record and attacked their opponent, former President Donald Trump.  “We believe in our president, Joe Biden, and we believe in what he stands for,” she said at the rally. Yet conversation continues to ebb and flow among Democrats about Mr Biden's chances, with high ranking members expressing varying levels of support for Mr Biden - and some even changing their minds - in a party-wide reckoning that has played out in media reports and private meetings.  Ms Harris hasn't wavered, but support has grown stronger for her as the party's path forward. Even Republicans have begun to incoporate her name into the Trump campaign's messaging. After making history as the first woman as well as the first black and Asian American vice president, supporters argue her current title as second-in-command could mark a more seamless transition if Biden passes the baton.  Despite having low approval ratings during her tenure as vice president, Ms Harris' supporters point to her advocacy for reproductive rights, appeal among black voters and her background as a prosecutor who would be running against a now-convicted felon to make the case for her serving as commander-in-chief:  ""I believe she has been instrumental in addressing key issues such as voting rights and immigration reform,""  Nadia Brown, director of Georgetown University's Women's and Gender Studies Program, said. ""She has also been Biden's most powerful surrogate on issues of abortion access and outreach to Black communities.""  Just five years ago, Ms Harris was the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency.  She began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. But her presidential aims were unsuccessful in 2020. Her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Her campaign died in less than a year and it was Mr Biden who returned the now 59-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 who critiqued her run for the presidential nomination, called it “a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris”. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent,” Duran said.  Ms Harris focused on several key initiatives while in the White House and she was instrumental in some of the Biden administration's most touted accomplishments. She launched a nationwide “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour advocating for women to have the right to make decisions about their body. She highlighted harm caused by abortion bans and called on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v Wade after the Supreme Court's conservative justices overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Ms Harris set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president in the history of the Senate. Her vote helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which provided COVID relief funding including stimulus payments.  Her tie-breaking vote also confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown Jakson to the Supreme Court. But she also struggled to achieve broad appeal among Americans, facing criticism on all sides.  Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not being progressive enough for some Democratic voters. ""Kamala is a cop"" was a common refrain on the 2020 campaign trail.  Mr Biden also called upon Ms Harris to lead efforts addressing the root causes of migration as a record number of immigrants fled to the US-Mexico border, an issue opponents point to as one where she hasn't made enough progress.  She received backlash from Republicans and some Democrats for taking six months to plan a trip to the border after entering office. But in recent weeks, as speculation about Mr Biden's ability to win in November swirled, she found a renewed base of support.  Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation,"" she said. They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa' and the Martin Luther King holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson said. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explained - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". She told the Washington Post in 2019 that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. From the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness,"" she said. Wit and humour is part of that armoury. In a video posted to her social media in 2020 after winning the election, she shares the news of the win - with a very hearty laugh - with Mr Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" The laugh she greeted the then president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate - to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 2014, then-Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff and became stepmother to his two children. She wrote an article for Elle magazine in 2019 about the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. Many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible.""",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2501n5rvvno,"Rachel Looker, Holly Honderich and Samanthi Dissanayake,",2024-07-19 15:10:21,,True
550,Ghosts of Olympics past leave their mark in Paris,"“If Greece is the cradle of the Olympics, Paris represents its home.” So begins a somewhat partisan account of the city’s long association with the Games, published ahead of its failed bid (to London) for 2012. Paris, wrote the author hopefully, is where the Olympic movement “rediscovered its vigour after an interminable historical amnesia,” and where there took place “so many important steps in its modern-day growth.” Step one was the founding congress of the International Olympic Committee, chaired by the French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin at Sorbonne university in June 1894. And then came steps two and three: the second and eighth Olympic Games, both organised in the French capital. Today there are still traces of both those Games. Here and there, if you look, their “legacy” is still very much alive. Exhibit one is the magnificent vélodrome in the Bois de Vincennes known as the Cipale (short for Municipale), which continues in use 124 years after the first Paris Games. Cycling was one of the most popular sports back in 1900, but the Cipale was also used for gymnastics, football, rugby … and cricket. It was on this hallowed turf that the (until now) only ever Olympic cricket match took place – between England and France. England won – but that still means France is the title holder of the Olympic silver.  That will presumably end in 2028 when cricket returns for Los Angeles – but who knows?! There have been renovations at La Cipale over the years but apart from the roof, the viewing stand is unchanged. So is the concrete track with its raised curves at either end, and there - forgotten behind the bushes in the corner - the original urinals, the relief of generations of hard-pressed cycling fans! The 1900 Games were strange ones, and are only just accepted today as part of the Olympic canon. Talking of cannons, one of the unusual events was artillery firing. There were also boules, fishing, crossbow-firing, barrel-rolling and long-distance ballooning.  The winner of that one landed near Kyiv. The difficulty was that the Games took place at exactly the same time as the Paris World Fair, and many people – including competitors - thought the sports were part of the World Fair. But they served an important purpose in establishing – after the first Greek edition in 1896 – that the Games were to be international, and not forever Hellene. And they helped advance the growing idea that sports were something to be taken seriously, and not just a frivolous pastime. The work of the French scientist Etienne Jules Marey was significant in this regard.  Famous for his photographic studies of sportsmen in action,  he persuaded many 1900 athletes to perform at his outdoor studio (under what is now Court 1 at Roland-Garros). Less brilliantly, he also sent round an anthropological questionnaire to Olympic participants seeking elucidation on such vital points as: the colour of their beards; the physical strength of their grandfathers; and whether they’d been fed as babies on breast or bottle. The 1900 Games were the first to see the participation – in golf, tennis, sailing and croquet - of (a few) women. By 1924, the sports of swimming, diving and fencing had been added, and 135 women took part. The main legacy of the 1924 Games is the Colombes stadium in the north-western Paris suburbs, where the opening ceremony and much of the subsequent sporting action were staged. The stadium – built on a former horse-racing track – went on to have a famed life, becoming for much of the last century France’s pre-eminent football and rugby venue, before being superseded by the Parc des Princes and then the Stade de France. Today it is very much still standing – and will be used in these Olympics as the venue for field hockey events. “For French people who love sport, Colombes is a place full of emotion,” says sports historian Mickael Delepine. “So many famous people have run and kicked and tackled here. It is full of ghosts."" For British sports fans, the ghosts are of sprinters Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell who won the golds here that were later immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire. The film faithfully recreated the stadium at a venue in the Wirral, Merseyside. In Colombes, the track is exactly where it was 100 years ago, overlooked by the same iron stand. The1924 Games were the first to take advantage of advances in communication - and winning athletes for the first time became household names. The Flying Finns Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola dominated middle-and long-distance racing, and long-jumper William de Hart-Hubbard was the first black man to win an event. Colombes also saw victory for the Uruguayan football team - setting up its triumph at the first World Cup on home turf in 1930.  And there was a famously dirty rugby final between the USA and France, whose violence contributed to the game being excluded from future Olympics.  (The USA won). The 1924 Olympics were also the first to display the Olympic motto - Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger); and the first to use a 50-metre swimming pool with lanes painted on the bottom. Among the heroes availing themselves of this innovation was one Johnny Weissmuller – later to find fame as cinema’s Tarzan. It all happened at the purpose-built Tourelles swimming pool in the 20th arrondissement of Paris.  A century on the pool is still there, and in use as a practice venue for today’s Olympic stars.",2024-07-19 23:10:22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cerv1142mmvo,"Hugh Schofield,",2024-07-19 05:10:22,,True
574,Bella Hadid's Adidas advert dropped after Israeli criticism,"Adidas has dropped the supermodel Bella Hadid, who is half Palestinian, from an advertising campaign for retro shoes referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics. Israel had criticised the choice of Ms Hadid. It accused her of hostility to Israel and noted that 11 Israeli athletes had been killed by Palestinian attackers at the Munich Games. Adidas subsequently apologised and said it would ""revise"" its campaign. Ms Hadid has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians and earlier this year donated money to support relief efforts for the war in Gaza. BBC News has contacted Hadid's representatives for comment. The German sportswear company had chosen Hadid to promote its SL72 trainers, which were first launched to coincide with the 1972 Olympics. Adidas recently relaunched the SL72 shoes as part of a series reviving classic trainers. However images of the American model wearing the shoes prompted criticism, including on Israel's official account on X (formerly Twitter). ""Guess who the face of their campaign is? Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model,"" a post read on Thursday. It referred to the attack at the 1972 games, which happened when members of the Palestinian Black September group broke into the Olympic village. In addition to the Israeli athletes, a German police officer was also killed. Other social media users defended Ms Hadid and called for a boycott of Adidas following the move to pull the campaign. Adidas confirmed to AFP that Hadid had been removed from the campaign. In a statement provided to the news agency, the company said it would be ""revising the remainder of the campaign"" with immediate effect. ""We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologise for any upset or distress caused."" Hadid, whose father is Palestinian property tycoon Mohamed Anwar Hadid, has been vocal in her support for people affected by the war in Gaza. In an Instagram post in May, Hadid said she was ""devastated at the loss of the Palestinian people and the lack of empathy coming from the government systems worldwide"". Last month, she and her supermodel sister Gigi donated $1m (£785,000) to support Palestinian relief efforts. The conflict in Gaza began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. More than 38,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqdwpv8vw1o,"Noor Nanji,",2024-07-20 11:08:59,,True
572,The African Tour de France cyclist racking up historic wins,"To his fans, he’s the “African king” - an international star and the first black African to win a Tour de France stage. Biniam Girmay did that not only once but three times this year at road cycling's premier event. Barring an accident, the 24-year-old looks set to win the green jersey on Sunday - a prize awarded to the best sprinter over the gruelling three-week competition.  But Girmay's journey to the top has been riddled with obstacles - he has battled culture shocks, Europe's visa procedures and the loneliness of being thousands of miles away from his wife and young daughter. Now, he is embracing his role as a hero in his home country - Eritrea - and an inspiration for cyclists across Africa as a whole. Many believe Girmay's success will spark change in an overwhelmingly white sport - in this year's Tour de France he is the only black rider in the whole peloton of 176 riders. Girmay - or Bini to his loved ones and fans - was born and raised in Eritrea, a small East African country with a population of around 3.7 million. Unusually, Girmay was never a champion of Asmara - the capital city he grew up in - or Eritrea. Instead, he appeared quite suddenly on the international stage after being scouted by cycling's global governing body, the UCI. Girmay told Eritrean media earlier this year that it is easier to win at the Tour de France than to be an Eritrean champion. This is because despite its tiny population, the country has a wealth of talented cyclists, many of whom have won medals in global and continental races. Cycling is one of Eritrea's most popular sports, a pastime picked up during decades of Italian colonial rule. It is a source of pride for many Eritreans, whose country usually only makes global headlines for its border conflicts and a human rights record considered to be poor by rights organisations, but fiercely defended by the government. Girmay's dreams of becoming a cyclist were sparked by his cousin, African champion Meron Teshome. The cycling obsession extends further into his family - his younger brother is now a professional rider and his father, a carpenter, used to watch the Tour de France on TV with Girmay every year. This is My Moment, a documentary charting his rise, shows an elderly female relative telling him: ""When I was young no-one could beat me, not even you!"" At 12 years old, Girmay won his first mountain bike competition and as a teenager he was selected to represent Eritrea as a junior in the African Championships. While there, he caught the eye of a UCI scout. They invited him to train at the organisation's World Cycling Centre (WCC), an elite Swiss facility that hosts young athletes from countries where there may not be so many opportunities for development. In 2018, at the age of 17, Girmay quit school and left home for Switzerland. The transition was tough, he had no friends or family nearby and was hit by a huge culture shock. ""It was tough to prepare Bini; he had to change a lot of things: his lifestyle, his routines,"" Jean-Jacques Henry, head of talent detection at the WCC, recalled as Girmay prepared for the 2023 Tour de France. ""It was too cold for him when he arrived in July. For us, it was warm. He didn't like cobblestones [which riders of Girmay's ilk often tackle] and he didn't understand tactics."" But he believed he would overcome these issues and realise his dream. He even took up English classes so he would not have to use a translator in media interviews when he eventually turned pro. Sure enough, in 2020, Girmay was scooped up by French team Delko. While training in France, he began planning his wedding with Saliem, his partner back in Eritrea. But the 2020 coronavirus outbreak scuppered his plans to return home - and also left him unable to compete in Europe as several races got cancelled. The following year, Girmay took another blow. Delko had gone bust, leaving the young cyclist without a team. He was, however, able to travel back to Asmara and marry Saliem. She later gave birth to a baby girl, but Girmay could not stick around for long as he had been signed by Belgian-based team Intermarché–Wanty. Securing a visa to continue his cycling odyssey was not easy - This Is My Moment documents the new father struggling to reach numerous visa application centres and embassies while in Asmara. Eventually, he managed to acquire a long-term visa, which he holds to this day. However, as per its requirements, Girmay has to leave Europe's Schengen zone of 29 countries every three months. He usually goes back to Asmara. In 2022, the cyclist began his history-making streak. At Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem, he became the first African to win a one-day classic race. Girmay was part of a four-rider breakaway in the last 30km and sprinted to victory with 250m to go. ""Veni... vidi... Bini!"" an ecstatic British commentator boomed as zoomed past finish line. The phrase, a play on the Latin for ""I came, I saw, I conquered"", has become somewhat of slogan among his fans and the media. As a sprinter, Girmay accelerates quickly towards the end of the race, embarking on a ferocious dash to the finish line. He is rarity - as a mountainous country Eritrea mostly produces ""climbers"", cyclists who race especially well on steep inclines. Girmay topped his Gent-Wevelgem victory with another history-making stage win at Giro d' Italia, which after the Tour de France is cycling's second biggest Grand Tour race. Celebrations were cut short when Girmay was taken to hospital - he had accidentally popped a prosecco cork in his eye on the winners' podium. He made a quick recovery, but without his wife and daughter around, he still struggled to enjoy his win. Despite this homesickness, Girmay battled on. His wife and daughter eventually moved to French city of Nice - and will be waiting for him after the Tour ends on Sunday. Also watching closely, will be cycling fans back in Eritrea.  After his third stage victory at the Tour, people spilled out onto the streets in Asmara, waving the national flag and dancing to a soundtrack of celebratory car horns. Eritrean fans often turn up to support Girmay away from home too - at the 2023 Tour de Suisse one fan told the BBC: ""He is an African king. We are proud. Eritrea is known for some bad things like war, now it is different."" Girmay also represents the wider continent, Mani Arthur, who runs the Black Cyclists Network and has competed for Ghana, told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast last week. “We don’t really see many black riders, especially from Africa, competing in the Tour de France,"" he said. ""So to see Girmay not only be competing but to also win a much coveted stage is incredible. He's proven himself to be amongst the best riders in the world."" Eritrean cycling coach Aklilu Haile, who has known Girmay for a decade, believes his success can have a big impact. ""Sometimes cycling seems like it's for white people only, but now he teaches us that cycling is for all the world,"" he said. Following the Tour de France, Girmay will take on this summer's Olympics in Paris. He hopes to win a gold medal but this is unlikely - he is the only road cyclist representing Eritrea and therefore will not have anyone to lead him out in the peleton to secure a space for his sprint. He also has high hopes for next year's World Championships in Rwanda, the country in which he was first scouted by the UCI. For many, a Girmay victory in Rwanda have huge significance.  Cycling fans from across the world would witness an African rider whizzing past a finish line on African soil, before being enveloped into a crowd flying the green, blue and yellow of the Eritrean flag.

The reusable bottles contain excessive levels of a chemical, Bisphenol A, says the official consumer recall agency, Rappel Conso.  The white flasks stamped with the Olympic rings and the Paris 2024 mascot, or the flame, were issued in August last year and sold until June. The authorities have urged people to return the bottles to the stores they bought them from. Bisphenol A - which has been widely used in making food containers - has been the subject of ongoing assessments about its safety to consumers.  According to France's food safety agency Anses, it is an endocrine disruptor - meaning it interferes with the body's hormones - and is believed to be linked to health issues including breast cancer and infertility. Associated with a wide array of health issues, Bisphenol A has been banned in France since 2015. Rappel Conso's website says the bottles made by the Vilac company have ""levels of Bisphenol A not in line with regulations"" on products designed for contact with foods.

On Sunday, the 38-year-old Spaniard will face seventh seed Nuno Borges, of Portugal, who beat unseeded Thiago Agustin Tirante, of Argentina, 6-4 6-3 in their semi-final. ""It was a very tough match - my opponent has one of the best backhands I have played against,"" said Nadal. ""He came here with a lot of confidence. I was trying to push him back and it was very difficult. I found a way to survive."" The final will be Nadal's 131st tour final, and 72nd on clay. ""It is always a good feeling to get back into a final,"" he added. ""I'm still in this process of recovering a lot of things that I lost because I had an important hip surgery almost a year ago. Things are not going that easy but I am fighting."" Nadal was also set to play in the Swedish Open men's doubles semi-final on Saturday with Casper Ruud, but the pair pulled out with Nadal conserving his energy for the singles final. Their withdrawal sends Brazil's Orlando Luz and Rafael Matos into the final. Nadal was competing in the doubles as preparation for his doubles partnership with Carlos Alcaraz at the Paris Olympics this summer. The Croat took the first set 6-4 but Nadal hit back with a strong performance in the second to win it 6-3. In the third Nadal started well with a double break to race to a 3-0 lead. But in the fourth game Ajdukovic had two break points on Nadal's serve and broke at the second time of asking. The break sparked a fire in Ajdukovic, who held and then broke again to level the third set 3-3. Nadal was the next to break in a close encounter and celebrated wildly when he saved multiple break points to hold and lead 5-3. Ajdukovic served to stay in the match and held, before Nadal did the same to claim victory. Across the match Nadal had six break points, winning each one.

601,The many identities of the first woman vice-president,"Less than four months out from the election, Vice-President Kamala Harris found herself in a difficult position. President Joe Biden's poor performance on the debate stage spurred mounting criticism about his ability to win the election. As anxiety turned to tension within the Democratic party, her name rose up the list of replacement candidates. With Mr Biden’s announcement that he will be ending his campaign and putting his support behind her, Ms Harris has finally reached a position she’d long sought: the top of the Democratic ticket, and potentially the presidency. But the journey there has been fraught and full of difficult questions, especially in recent months. Four years ago, the one-time candidate for the Democratic nomination would have welcomed the party's praises. By July 2024, Harris was in a more precarious position as part of an embattled incumbent ticket, her chances of another term tethered to Mr Biden’s performance. In the 24 hours after the debate debacle, Ms Harris chose strong loyalty to Mr Biden. The vice-president spoke on CNN, MSNBC and at a campaign rally. She defended her political partner's record and attacked their opponent, former President Donald Trump. “We believe in our president, Joe Biden, and we believe in what he stands for,” she said at the rally. Ms Harris never wavered as a new well of support within the Democratic party pushed her into the spotlight and critics pressed Mr Biden to retire. Still, it’s a second chance at a presidential campaign for the first woman as well as the first black and Asian-American to serve as vice-president. Despite struggling to appeal to voters in 2020 and having low approval ratings during her tenure as vice president, Ms Harris' supporters point to her advocacy for reproductive rights, appeal among black voters and her background as a prosecutor who would be running against a now-convicted felon to make the case for her serving as commander-in-chief. ""I believe she has been instrumental in addressing key issues such as voting rights and immigration reform,"" Nadia Brown, director of Georgetown University's Women's and Gender Studies Program, said.  ""She has also been Biden's most powerful surrogate on issues of abortion access and outreach to black communities."" Just five years ago, Ms Harris was the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency.  She began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. But her presidential aims were unsuccessful in 2020. Her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Her campaign died in less than a year and it was Mr Biden who returned the now 59-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 who critiqued her run for the presidential nomination, called it “a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris”. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent,” Duran said.  Ms Harris focused on several key initiatives while in the White House and she was instrumental in some of the Biden administration's most touted accomplishments. She launched a nationwide “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour advocating for women to have the right to make decisions about their body. She highlighted harm caused by abortion bans and called on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v Wade after the Supreme Court's conservative justices overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Ms Harris set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president in the history of the Senate. Her vote helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which provided COVID relief funding including stimulus payments.  Her tie-breaking vote also confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown Jakson to the Supreme Court. But she also struggled to achieve broad appeal among Americans, facing criticism on all sides.  Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not being progressive enough for some Democratic voters. ""Kamala is a cop"" was a common refrain on the 2020 campaign trail.  Mr Biden also called upon Ms Harris to lead efforts addressing the root causes of migration as a record number of immigrants fled to the US-Mexico border, an issue opponents point to as one where she hasn't made enough progress.  She received backlash from Republicans and some Democrats for taking six months to plan a trip to the border after entering office. But in recent weeks, as speculation about Mr Biden's ability to win in November swirled, she found a renewed base of support.  Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation,"" she said. They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa' and the Martin Luther King holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson said. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explained - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". She told the Washington Post in 2019 that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. From the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness,"" she said. Wit and humour is part of that armoury. In a video posted to her social media in 2020 after winning the election, she shares the news of the win - with a very hearty laugh - with Mr Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" The laugh she greeted the then president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate - to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 2014, then-Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff and became stepmother to his two children. She wrote an article for Elle magazine in 2019 about the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. Many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible.""",2024-07-21 23:10:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2501n5rvvno,"Rachel Looker and Holly Honderich,",2024-07-21 19:10:18,,True
598,Republicans call on Biden to leave White House,"Many Republicans quickly called on President Joe Biden to resign and leave the White House after his announcement on Sunday that he would withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. Republican leaders said that Mr Biden's decision to step aside confirmed their view that he was not in cognitive shape to serve as president - an issue that has dogged the Democrat since his disastrous debate last month.   ""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, the most powerful Republican in congress. ""He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,"" referring to election day. Mr Biden, in announcing that he was dropping out,  said he would stay in office until the end of his term in January. The White House a few hours later on Sunday reiterated he would not resign, stating: ""He looks forward to finish his term and delivering more historic results for the American people."" Leading Republicans piled on with similar calls to resign throughout Sunday afternoon, as they also directed fresh attacks at Vice-President Kamala Harris, who would move into the Oval Office should Mr Biden resign. Mr Biden has endorsed her to be the next Democratic nominee.  New York Representative Elise Stefanik, the Republican conference chair, made almost the exact same statement as Mr Johnson's about Mr Biden's ability to fulfil his presidential duties.  She closed her statement similarly as well: ""He must immediately resign."" Mr Biden's rival for president, Donald Trump, said the Democratic leader was ""not fit to serve from the very beginning"" in response to the announcement - though he did not call for the president to resign. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who chairs Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said that being president  ""is the hardest job in the world"".  ""And I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,” he said in a statement.  Another Republican senator, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, went further and appeared to suggest that Mr Biden should be forced from office by exercising the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution - a never-used method to replace the president if he cannot fulfil his duties.  Critics of Trump had called for using the amendment to remove him when he was in office. Many in the political world had been expecting to Mr Biden to drop out of the race.  His rambling, frequently incoherent answers in the June 27 debate with Trump had stunned the country and left people wondering if he could serve as president for another four years. While in speeches and interviews Mr Biden often showed renewed vigour, he was also dogged by major stumbles and seeming memory problems.  Democrats in congress, worried that his shakiness would hurt their chances at re-election, and major donors began to press for him to drop out, but they did not press for him to resign.   The last president to abandon his election campaign, Lyndon B. Johnson, also served out the remainder of his term. Like Mr Biden, Johnson had said that giving up the race would allow him to focus on his presidential duties.  As the pressure on Mr Biden has grown in recent weeks, Republicans became more vocal about a resignation. Just hours before the president announced he was stepping aside, Trump's new running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, said: ""Not running for reelection would be a clear admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough to serve as Commander-in-Chief. There is no middle ground."" ""Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way,"" he added. Mr Biden has endorsed Ms Harris to take up the mantle of the presidential campaign, although the party will still have to formally approve its nominee. ""I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" Ms Harris said in a statement. ""I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda."" Republicans have reportedly prepared to attack Ms Harris's candidacy - as many believed she was the most likely successor.  Trump campaign sources have told US media outlets that they were readying attack ads and opposition research in case they faced her.  Most criticism centres on the vice-president's lead role on immigration issues within the administration. Several speakers at the Republican convention last week portrayed Ms Harris as a failed ""border czar"".  Those attacks returned on Sunday. Speaker Johnson called her ""a completely inept border czar"" and said she had been ""a gleeful accomplice"" in ""the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity"". ""She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve,"" he said, while also accusing her of being part of a political coverup of Mr Biden's problems. Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, known for taking a hard line on immigration that has led to legal actions, also expressed concerns about Ms Harris becoming president.  ""I think I will need to triple the border wall, razor wire barriers and National Guard on the border,"" he wrote on social media. Donald Trump Jr, the former president's son, broadly said her policies would be no different than Mr Biden's. ""Kamala Harris owns the entire left-wing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter.",2024-07-21 23:10:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0ek9el6ro,"Phil McCausland & Bernd Debusmann,",2024-07-21 22:20:18,,True
592,Who could challenge Harris for Democratic nomination?,"Joe Biden on Sunday announced he would end his re-election campaign, and said Kamala Harris, his vice-president, should take his place.  ""I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,"" he wrote on X. ""Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump."" Ms Harris taking over is not a done deal, however.  Several others have been touted as potential replacements in the weeks leading to Mr Biden's withdrawal. Many have paid tribute to Mr Biden after his announcement - but crucially almost none have said explicitly that they support the Harris endorsement.  Delegates will vote next month at the Democratic National Convention to officially confirm who will replace Mr Biden. Here is a look at the names who could challenge Ms Harris. Gretchen Whitmer, the two-term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular Midwest Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  Ms Whitmer quickly stated after Mr Biden's withdrawal that her job ""will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump."" That, however, was not an endorsement of Ms Harris. California's governor is one of the Biden administration's fiercest surrogates. But he has political ambitions of his own.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits now say that he could replace Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  He stood by the president before his announcement. He travelled to Washington to attend meetings in July with Mr Biden and other top Democratic governors, and headlined a Biden campaign event in Michigan on the 4 July. Mr Newsom again praised Mr Biden as a ""selfless"" president after his withdrawal was announced. But his statement on Twitter was brief, and mentioned nothing of his own intentions nor commented on the endorsement of Ms Harris. It is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as transportation secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Mr Buttigieg stated on Twitter/X that Mr Biden had ""earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history"". He did not comment on his endorsement of Ms Harris. Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The speedy repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  Mr Shapiro said Mr Biden was one of the ""most consequential presidents in modern history"" after the president announced his withdrawal from the election race but - like most names touted to replace him - said nothing of what comes next.  JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats' to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  He did not immediately comment on Mr Biden's decision to withdraw from the election race. The list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.   Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.  Maryland Governor Wes Moore found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested Senate race in a swing state, also has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.  A Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama. But the former first lady has repeatedly said she does not have presidential aspirations.

596,"Biden drops out, upending race for White House","US President Joe Biden has ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic candidate, in an extraordinary decision that upends an already dramatic race for the White House. Mr Biden, 81, said in a Sunday written statement that it was the ""greatest honour"" to serve but his withdrawal was ""in the best interest of my party and the country"".  Mr Biden had faced intense pressure to step down over concerns about his age and mental fitness. Mr Biden insists he will remain as president until January. Ms Harris, 59, said that she was ""honoured"" to be endorsed, adding she would ""earn and win this nomination"" and unite the country against Donald Trump. ""We have 107 days until election day,"" she said. ""Together, we will fight. And together, we will win."" However, several other senior Democrats are also being touted as replacements, and a choice must be made at the party's national convention in Chicago in August. If the party struggles to unify around Ms Harris, the battle to succeed Mr Biden could play out on the convention floor. Mr Biden's announcement caps a tumultuous period in US politics, which began with his sometimes incoherent debate performance against Trump on 27 June, fuelling concerns over his age and capacity to win re-election. As Democratic donors and dozens of politicians called on Mr Biden to step aside, a resurgent Trump pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt. Trump said on Sunday that the president ""was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve"". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately.  Party sources told the BBC that White House staff were told only moments before the statement was released on Sunday afternoon, although Mr Biden had spoken to Ms Harris. Dozens of senior Democrats and party grandees including Barack Obama, the former president, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately praised the decision and lauded Mr Biden's accomplishments in office. However, not all have openly accepted Mr Biden's endorsement of Ms Harris. Mr Obama stated that he had ""extraordinary confidence"" that an ""outstanding nominee emerges"" but did not explicitly back Ms Harris. Ms Pelosi has not commented. Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an ""open process"" to nominate Harris. Former president Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton said they backed her as a candidate, saying they would ""fight with everything we've got to elect her"". Several of those who could challenge for the nomination also praised Mr Biden - but stopped short of commenting on his endorsement of his vice-president. Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, stated that her job ""will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump.""  Gavin Newsom, California's governor, praised Mr Biden as a ""selfless"" president, but stopped short of further comment on who would succeed him. Pete Buttigieg, the current transport secretary, said Mr Biden had ""earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history"". He too did not address the next step for the party. The Democratic National Committee meanwhile filed to amend the names of its fundraising committees to the Harris Victory Fund and Harris Action Fund. Meanwhile two major Democratic donors - LinkedIn co-funder Reid Hoffman and investor Alexander Soros - publicly endorsed Harris. Mr Hoffman said on X/Twitter that when ""presented with the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, I believe in the American people to make the right decision for our country"". But within an hour of Mr Biden's announcement, the pro-Trump super-PAC campaign fund Make America Great Again posted an advert attacking Mr Harris, claiming ""she covered up Joe's obvious mental decline"". Donald Trump added: ""Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same."" Mr Biden had faced intense scrutiny since his debate performance in June. Less than two weeks ago, he hosted a high-profile summit with Nato leaders in Washington. The occasion did little to calm nerves within his own party, with him mistakenly introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin”, and appearing to refer Ms Harris as ""Vice President Trump"".  At one point he told an interview that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could make him withdraw, but then later said he would consider withdrawing if he had a health condition. On Friday, while in isolation after testing positive for Covid, he pledged to return to the campaign trail in the coming week. In his statement on Sunday, Mr Biden thanked his Ms Harris, saying she was an ""extraordinary partner"".  ""And let me express my heartfelt appreciation for the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me,"" his statement added. ""I believe today and always have: that there is nothing America can’t do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.""  Officials from the Democratic National Committee held an emergency meeting on Sunday evening. The focus will now be on the party's national convention, which is scheduled to start on 19 August.  Mr Biden swept the party's primaries, meaning that the delegates representing each state at the convention were pledged to vote for him - although they are now expected to be released to vote for another candidate.

597,Biden has endorsed Harris. What happens next?,"President Joe Biden surprised American voters on Sunday when he announced he would drop out of the race for president after weeks of resisting calls to step down.  Though he will carry out the rest of his presidency, he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place as the Democratic Party's nominee.  The decision throws the party into uncharted waters with just a month to go before the Democratic National Convention.  Here's a guide to what could come next. The last time an incumbent US president abandoned their campaign for re-election was Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1968. As a result, the path for nominating a new candidate so close to Election Day is unclear.  President Biden had already won 3,896 pledged delegates - much more than the amount needed to secure his party's nomination.  While Mr Biden's endorsement makes Ms Harris the most likely pick for the nominee, after he releases his delegates, they are no longer pledged to a candidate.  It will ultimately be up to them to vote for whomever they choose.  The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to begin on 19 August.  If the Democratic Party does not come together to support a new candidate, that could set the stage for an open convention for the first time since 1968.  That would mean delegates would be free to decide who to vote for among multiple candidates if they emerge. Candidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates - no more than 50 coming from one state - for their name to appear on the ballot.  There would be an initial round of voting among the 3,900 pledged delegates, which includes voters deemed loyal to the Democratic party.  If no candidate receives a majority of votes after this first round, then more rounds of voting would take place. These rounds of voting would include superdelegates - party leaders and elected officials - who would all cast ballots until a nominee is chosen.  To secure the party nomination, a candidate needs 1,976 delegate votes. As calls grew for Mr Biden to drop out of the race in recent weeks, a number of potential replacements emerged.  Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been floated as a candidate, though she has said she would not consider running if Mr Biden stepped aside. On Sunday, minutes after Mr Biden's announcement, she said she would do everything she can ""to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump"". Other options include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  Some of these candidates could be considered for the role of vice president if Ms Harris does ultimately win the nomination.

613,Trump tells Michigan rally he 'took a bullet for democracy',"Donald Trump has told a rally in Michigan that he ""took a bullet for democracy"" when an attempt was made on his life last week. He also derided President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the event in Grand Rapids - his first with new running mate JD Vance and the first since he survived the assassination attempt. He told a packed arena that Democrats had accused him of being ""a threat to democracy"" and, to huge applause, said he was ready to ""take back the White House"". An investigation is under way into the shooting last weekend, which left Trump with a wounded ear - though the prominent white bandage he wore throughout the Republican National Convention had on Saturday been replaced by a discreet flesh-toned plaster. The gunman flew a drone above the site of the shooting ahead of time, law enforcement officials have told US media. The Grand Rapids event was one of several campaign stops the former president has made in the key battleground state, as polls show him in a close race against Mr Biden. Mr Biden, meanwhile, has had to pause campaign events after testing positive for Covid-19. He continues to resist growing calls from members of his own party to drop out of the race due to concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. During his speech Mr Trump repeated the falsehood that the 2020 election - which he lost to Mr Biden - had been ""rigged"". He mocked the crisis around Mr Biden's own bid for re-election as president, saying: ""They don't know who their candidate is, and neither do we."" In rhetoric that departed from his calls for unity immediately after the shooting, he used insulting language about Mr Biden and about Ms Harris, who is well-placed to become the Democratic nominee if Mr Biden steps aside. Mr Trump again sought to distance himself from Project 2025 - a detailed 900-page proposal from the Heritage Foundation think tank.  Led by former Trump administration officials, Project 2025 calls for measures including the sacking of thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education, sweeping tax cuts, a ban on pornography and halting sales of the abortion pill. ""The radical right... they're seriously extreme,"" he said.  Trump was not scheduled to address the crowd until 17:00 EST (21:00 GMT) but by 13:00, a line stretched for about three miles (4.8km) outside the 12,000-person Van Del Arena. Many of those at the event, in the battleground state of Michigan, told the BBC that the assassination attempt - which killed an audience member and wounded two others - would not stop them from showing support for the Republican presidential nominee.  Some said they came precisely because of the shooting. Unlike that rally, held in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Grand Rapids event was indoors - allowing security officers to carefully monitor who entered and to cut off threats from outside the rally. In his speech, Trump thanked the “thousands and thousands” of people who came to see him “almost exactly” a week after the assassination attempt. “I stand before you only by the grace of almighty God,” he said, repeating his belief that divine intervention saved him from being killed. Wendy and Steve Upcott of Clarkston, Michigan, were among the thousands who drove from all over the state to see him, many reassured by the increased security. The couple said their 26-year-old daughter begged them not to attend the event two hours from home, fearing for their safety in the wake of the assassination attempt. But they felt obliged to come after the shooting last weekend. “The chances of it happening again just one week to the day later is unlikely,” said Ms Upcott. Them and many others in Grand Rapids were decked out in red Make America Great Again caps, along with cowboy hats, shirts and full outfits resembling the American flag. T-shirts with Trump's mug shot were also for sale. Laura Schultz said she thought about her safety on Saturday morning before she decided to come to the event with a friend. “You can’t let fear stop you,” she said. Other rally-goers, including several young adults, said the assassination attempt pushed them to attend the Michigan rally. It was the first Trump campaign event for fellow Donald, a 24 year old from Grand Rapids, who wore a shirt with the viral image of Trump pumping his fist after being shot. “This is the first event after the attempted assassination. I think it’s probably going to be the most important rally,” he said,  declining to share his last name. Donald said he had no fears for his own safety, because of the hundreds of police officers, including some on horseback. But others said they remained scared for Trump. “It should be a concern for most Americans that he is still not safe,” Ms Upcott said. “He needs to be very careful,” said Ms Schultz. Other supporters expressed outrage at the US Secret Service over the incident last week.  The agency has faced intense scrutiny after shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to take aim at Trump in Pennsylvania by climbing onto a roof of a building near the rally stage, even after rallygoers pointed him out to police. Investigators have still yet to name a motive for the 20-year-old gunman who was later killed by Secret Service agents. Since then, the country has become more attuned to possible threats to both presidential candidates. Police in Jupiter, Florida, on Friday arrested a man for allegedly posting threats to Trump on social media, while a different man from Florida was arrested a few days earlier for allegedly threatening President Joe Biden. Saturday's Michigan indoor event space was much easier to secure, with metal detectors and military personnel sweeping the whole building, said former Secret Service agent Jason Russell, who has worked on campaign events at the Grand Rapids arena. “You’ll have a pretty, pretty significant number of agents on site,” Mr Russell said, adding that they would be able to keep Trump out of view until his entrance. On Saturday, the former White House physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, released a statement about his condition after having examined Trump.  The bullet created a 2cm-wide wound on Trump's ear that extended down to the cartilage, Dr Jackson said, which is beginning to ""heal properly."" No stitches had been needed, he added. Trump's campaign also announced that it plans to hold its next rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on 24 July at the Bojangles Coliseum.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngwzd4y83o,"Madeline Halpert,",2024-07-21 03:10:19,,True

It claims that Prime is using trademarked Olympic phrases and symbols on a special edition of its hydration drink featuring basketball star and three-time Olympic gold medallist Kevin Durant.  The committee said it does not have an agreement with Prime for the use of its terminology and trademarks, and said its actions had been ""deliberate"" and ""in bad faith"". The BBC has contacted Prime for comment.  The committee filed the lawsuit in Colorado on Friday, and also accused Prime of using the trademarks in internet campaigns and promotions. The lawsuit, seen by the BBC's partner CBS News, said that consumers could be misled into thinking there is an agreement between the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Prime.  The organisation said it had issued a cease and desist letter to Prime, but the drinks brand had continued to market the product, using the branding.  Criticism has previously been levelled at the company due to it being marketed at a younger audience, with some schools in the UK issuing warnings or choosing to ban it.  While the company's energy drink contains caffeine, it also sells a drink marketed for ""hydration"", which is caffeine-free.  Earlier this month, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation into the brand due to the high caffeine content of its energy drink.  Responding to this, Prime has said that it complies with regulatory requirements in the countries it operates in.  Prime founders Logan Paul and KSI have over 40 million YouTube followers between them.   Prime was released in the UK with much hype in 2022 - resulting in some shops limiting the number of bottles which could be sold per customer. It has collaborated with some of the biggest sporting stars and teams in the world including Arsenal and the LA Dodgers.

618,"Two down, two to go - Schauffele eyes slam after Open triumph","This video can not be played Schauffele wins The Open 2024 On the final day of an intense Open Championship, played out in a glorious amalgam of wind and rain and sunshine from first thing on Thursday, Xander Schauffele carried himself with the kind of zen that could make Buddha look fretful. The American said he got “chills” en route to the final green on Sunday, but it didn’t show. To the watching world he was impossibly cool and improbably collected.  He displayed a steely focus and a precision that laid waste to a pack that spent much of the day tightly bunched together, like a peloton awaiting a sprint finish. There was no sprint, though. There was a breakaway and nobody could go with it.   “It's an honour,” he said, looking at his Claret Jug. “I've always dreamt of doing it.  ""That walk up 18 truly is the coolest with the yellow leaderboards and the fans and the standing ovation. It really is one of the coolest feelings I've ever had in my life.” Schauffele holds off Rose to win Open at Troon 'No regrets' for Rose after Open dream falters in final holes The Open final leaderboard He talked of “super stressful moments” but that was part of Schauffele’s brilliance. Whatever emotion he was feeling, he never gave any hint of it.  Where did this round rate in the thousands he has played? “At the very tip top.” He called the back nine at Royal Troon the hardest nine holes he’s ever played and yet he mastered them in 31 shots. Four birdies and no bogeys on a stretch of holes that found out the greatest players on the planet all week. When Schauffele won his first major championship, the US PGA at Valhalla in May, his parents and, you sense, his greatest influences were far away from Louisville. When he won his second on Sunday they were right by his side.  His dad, Stefan, was in the media centre when his son did the winners’ news conference, standing away to the side and in a blindspot to the stage, so much so that Schauffele needed telling that his dad was present. Another major, but a different vibe.  When Schauffele won at Valhalla, his folks were at their place on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a cargo container that doubles as their oasis from life in San Diego. No running water, no air conditioning. Splendid isolation. Not an ideal spot to be when your boy has just fulfilled his life’s dream of winning a major, though. They followed it on their phone, which presented its own challenges, but it was emotional all the same.  “Once he made that putt [to win the PGA],"" said Stefan, “I started to melt like a piece of butter in a skillet.” This time, there would be no long-distance celebrations. Stefan and Ping Yi were here, as large as life. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Xander Schauffele's winning round Americans love their father-son stories in sport and the Schauffele yarn is up there with the best of them.  Stefan, who grew up in Germany, was a decathlete back in the day, an aspiring Olympian who had his own dream crushed when hit by a drunk driver at the age of 20. He lost the sight in an eye and experienced trauma in his life.  “There was some depression and alcoholism,” he said in a recent interview. “That’s what led me to moving to America.” He had a son and from the age of nine, Xander was a player. Stefan coached him and, from time to time, argued with him. Madly, on occasion.   Everything paid off. A golfing machine was forged and we saw it in all its formidable glory at Royal Troon this past week. “Now he’s got this first major,” said Stefan after Valhalla, “it’s the first one of the four [nobody in Team Schauffele is shying away from the target of a Grand Slam].  ""I’ve got a good feeling he’ll get the second one of the four this year. With him being as consistent as he is now, everybody is on notice.” Prescient words. For a number of years, Schauffele was deemed golf’s nearly man, a supremely talented player who couldn’t back up his excellence with titles.  This is his time now. Two majors in a single year is an other-worldly achievement in this era of the game, a period so full of established winners and thrusting young things who are utterly unafraid of winning. Schauffele said he had a chip on his shoulder about some of the negativity thrown at him. He used it as fuel.  What’s he going to use for motivation now that he’s an acclaimed double major winner? “If you look hard enough, you can always find it,” he said.   “It's something, when you feel like you need an extra kick in the butt, there's several easy ways to motivate yourself.  ""There's still a lot of things that I'd like to do in my career, and this is a very big leap towards that. The fire is still burning, maybe brighter than ever.” He has the Olympics in Paris next, a gold medal to defend from his glory in Tokyo, another dream to chase before returning to the majors circuit next year. That is terrain he will travel as a two-time champion and an increasing force to be reckoned with in the ferocious environment of elite golf.  Small in stature, for sure. But Schauffele is a colossus now.",2024-07-21 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cj50d114nrqo,Tom English,2024-07-21 21:10:21,,True
622,Pogacar seals third Tour de France with stage 21 win,"Tadej Pogacar previously won the Tour de France in 2020 and 2021 Tadej Pogacar sealed a sensational Tour de France-Giro d'Italia double by winning the stage 21 time trial into Nice. The UAE Team Emirates rider finished the Tour with a sixth stage victory and became the first man to win cycling's two biggest races in the same year since Italian Marco Pantani in 1998.  The Tour's finale was held outside of Paris for the first time since 1903 as the French capital prepares to host the Olympics. Wearing the yellow jersey Slovenia's Pogacar, 25, finished the stage 63 seconds clear of second-placed Jonas Vingegaard. The win secured his third Tour de France title, extending his lead over nearest rival and two-time winner Vingegaard, of Visma–Lease a Bike, to six minutes and 17 seconds. ""I cannot describe how happy I am,"" said Pogacar.   ""After two hard years in the Tour de France, this year everything went to perfection."" Tour debutant Remco Evenepoel, riding for Soudal–Quick-Step, finished third on the stage and completed the general classification podium, nine minutes and 18 seconds behind Pogacar. The 2024 edition will also be remembered for Mark Cavendish's record 35th stage victory in Saint Vulbas in the opening week. After completing the final stage, the legendary British sprinter said this year's Tour is likely to have been his last race. Tour de France 'likely' to be final race - Cavendish The African Tour de France cyclist racking up historic wins As well as two Grand Tours Pogacar has also won the Classics Liege–Bastogne–Liege and Strade Bianche this season Pogacar dominated this year's Tour de France - becoming the first rider to win six stages in a single edition since Cavendish in 2009. He also spent 19 days in the yellow jersey, holding it exclusively from stage four. This year's Tour was arguably won on stage 15 where, already ahead by almost two minutes, Pogacar stormed to victory on a gruelling climb up to Plateau de Beille to extend his lead over Vingegaard by another 69 seconds. Four days later he had overall victory wrapped up, ascending to Isola 2000 where he put a further one minute and 42 seconds into his nearest rivals. The Slovenian looked a level above Vingegaard, who he finished second behind at the last two editions, with the Dane still recovering from a broken collarbone and ribs suffered in April. But even a fully fit Vingegaard would have struggled to match Pogacar's pace. His Tour de France dominance matches his performance at this year's Giro d'Italia, where he blew away the competition to win by nine minutes and 56 seconds. ""Already it would have been an incredible year, but to win the Tour de France is another level,"" added Pogacar. ""To win both together is another level above that level."" In July Pogacar said he was ""99% sure"" he would not compete at this year's Vuelta a Espana, where he could become the first ever rider to win all three Grand Tours in the same calendar year. He will represent Slovenia in the men's road race at the Olympics in Paris on 3 August. Only Pogacar won more stages than Biniam Girmay in this year's race By finishing safely in Nice, sprinter Biniam Girmay made history - becoming the first black African winner of the Tour de France points classification. He had a sensational race. On day three he became the first Eritrean to win a stage at the Tour, and he went on to record two more victories - on stage eight and stage 12. The green jersey winner, 24, was one of only six black African riders in the top-level WorldTour peloton of 534 in 2023, the year he made his Tour de France debut. The 'African king' has battled through visa issues and loneliness since he moved to Europe six years ago. The King of the Mountains classification was won by Richard Carapaz while Belgian Evenepoel, 24, claimed the white jersey as the best rider in the general classification under the age of 25.

633,Lawmakers call on Secret Service boss to resign,"Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers called on Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to step down in the wake of the assassination attempt of Donald Trump.  The demand came during and after a tense House Oversight Committee hearing on Monday that questioned Ms Cheatle about her agency's security preparations ahead of a 13 July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that led to the attempt on Trump's life.  The shooting left one person dead and three other wounded - including the former president.  Monday's hearing was bruising for Ms Cheatle, as lawmakers ridiculed her answers and the lack of information the agency had made public, but it was also a rare show of bipartisanship on an increasingly polarised Capitol Hill. For nearly six hours, members sought to answer lingering questions about the shooting, including how suspect Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to get onto a nearby rooftop and why Trump was allowed to take the stage once a suspicious person was reported.  After the hearing, the leading Republican and Democrat from the committee - Reps James Comer and Jamie Raskin - sent a letter to Ms Cheatle that concretely laid out their belief that she should vacate her office. ""In the middle of a presidential election, the Committee and the American people demand serious institutional accountability and transparency that you are not providing,"" the letter says. ""We call on you to resign as Director as a first step to allowing new leadership to swiftly address this crisis and rebuild the trust of a truly concerned Congress and the American people."" While Ms Cheatle took responsibility during the hearing for the security lapses and acknowledged that the Butler incident marks ""the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades"", she left many lawmakers frustrated.  Ms Cheatle pushed back on calls to resign and said she remains ""the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time"".  The Secret Service director also answered few questions directly - citing the ongoing investigation. ""The American people have questions, [and] they deserve answers,"" Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told Ms Cheatle during his closing. ""You were required to provide answers and, ma'am, you did not."" At times, the tense hearing on Monday seemed to devolve into fury. Lawmakers used expletives, shouted at the witness and questioned the director's honesty and competence.  ""I'm disgusted by your performance,"" Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna said. Ms Cheatle's answers seemed to continuously spark the ire of lawmakers on the committee, many of whom said she should be dismissed if she continued to refuse to resign.  ""It looks like you won't answer some pretty basic questions,"" Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, said. ""And it looks like you cut corners when it comes to protecting one of the most well-known individuals on the planet."" Throughout the hearing, some Representatives groaned loudly, rolled their eyes, or muttered audibly in response to Cheatle's comments.  In one of the tensest moments of the hearing, South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace uttered a string of expletives in response to another one of Ms Cheatle's answers, specifically about how her opening remarks were leaked to US media outlets over the weekend.  ""You are being dishonest or lying,"" Mace said. ""You're just dodging!""  Another Republican, Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene, shouted at Ms Cheatle, referring to her as a ""total failure"".  ""The entire country is demanding you resign,"" Ms Greene said.  Ms Cheatle also acknowledged that, to date, no Secret Service officers or employees have been disciplined for what took place in Butler.  According to Ms Cheatle, a preliminary report on the shooting will be released in the next 60 days - a timeline that committee members scoffed at.  New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, said that the delay of such a report during a tense election season was ""not acceptable"".  ""This is not theatre, this is not about jockeying, this is about the safety of some of the most highly targeted and valued targets internationally and domestically,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez said. There needs to be answers. We need to make policy decisions."" ""Without that, we're flying blind,"" she added.  Despite the relative show of unity regarding Ms Cheatle's future, there were some points of disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on the committee.  Several Republicans, for example, characterised Ms Cheatle as a ""DEI"" - diversity, equity and inclusion - hire and questioned, without evidence, whether female agents assigned to Trump's security detail were able to do the job properly.  Others, such as Colorado's Lauren Boebert and Ms Luna of Florida, hinted at conspiracy theories that have appeared online.  Florida Republican Michael Waltz blamed Ms Cheatle for the rumours, arguing that misinformation ""flies"" in the absence of information.  ""I would have fired you just by how you handled this,"" Mr Waltz said, ""because you should have been the first to the mics."" The hearing ended with Mr Comer acknowledging that the hearing did little to answer the questions that Congress had.  ""I don't think we answered too many questions that the American people have,"" he said. Several eyewitnesses to the shooting in Butler told the BBC that Ms Cheatle's answers left them feeling frustrated and angry.  ""She's trying to pass the buck,"" said Jean Vincent, a Butler resident. ""I'm actually amazed at how insufficient her answers were. She needs to be held accountable for her total lack of competency... she put our lives at risk and needs to take responsibility.""  Another witness, former US Marine Teresa Wilson, said that while she understands that there are active investigations still taking place, Ms Cheatle was far too ""evasive"".  ""The only acceptable thing she could have done is take responsibility and step down,"" Ms Wilson said. ""All the rest is noise.""",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx02edwg31do,Unknown,Unknown,,True
641,The last days of the Biden campaign – as seen on Air Force One,"Five nights ago, I stood on the tarmac at Dover Air Force Base and watched Joe Biden, wearing a dark jacket and baseball cap, gingerly descend the staircase of Air Force One.  From my position in the travelling press pool, I saw each unsteady step downward being scrutinised as closely as his acts of office. From the plane emerged an inescapable scene of frailty. The human weakness of age seemed to have overcome the most powerful man on earth. Mr Biden, 81, had just tested positive for Covid. We had flown back with him from Las Vegas in what became a debilitating end to a trip meant to see him hitting the campaign trail with full force.  The scene at Dover, now being replayed over and over on the news channels covering his election exit, was his last public appearance before he pulled out of the race on Sunday. If feels now like the image of the end of his candidacy. So much changed in a week. Last Monday, when I and other press joined him aboard the presidential plane for that campaign trip to Nevada, the president clearly felt the Democratic nomination was still his to hold onto. Donald Trump had dodged an assassin’s bullet two days earlier, giving Mr Biden a political reprieve from the growing calls from Congressional Democrats for him to step down from the race.  His campaign hoped the trip would reinvigorate black and Hispanic voters who traditionally overwhelmingly back the Democrats but whose support for Mr Biden had slipped since 2020. On Tuesday, I watched him energise a packed convention hall with a speech to the African-American civil rights group the NAACP. I spoke to some delegates who were literally dancing in the aisles before Mr Biden’s speech. “Four more years” echoed through the venue. But the next morning, things began to spin out of control. The end of the road was the Original Lindo Michoácan Restaurant, Las Vegas, Nevada. This was one of those highly orchestrated campaign stops where the president mingles with voters. The press was ushered inside to capture the president’s entrance. As the door swung open, I was struck by how pale he looked, and how much slower he seemed than the day before as he shook hands with diners.  We shouted questions about the growing list of Democrats questioning his fitness to run – he didn’t answer. Then we were hustled back out to the press vans while he did a radio interview inside. We waited. And waited. In the searing Nevada heat we spent more than 90 minutes in the press vans with the entire motorcade stalled. It was by now obvious that something was wrong. Suddenly, an email dropped from a BBC colleague to say the host of his next speech venue had announced, on stage, that Mr Biden had just tested positive for Covid. As I tried to approach a White House staffer to find out what was going on, I was abruptly ordered to get back in my van, and told that we were leaving. The motorcade began rolling and we were speeding our way through the suburbs of Las Vegas, destination unknown. The campaign was changing course. Suddenly, amid the flashing lights and police outriders, the airport came into view. The president was going home to Delaware to recover from Covid, the campaign trip was over.  Soon his campaign would be too, when he made the announcement that he was no longer running for president from his beachside home just days later. In hindsight, his last appearance at the air force base in Dover seemed like a final attempt to defy the inevitable, what campaign-donor George Clooney called “the battle against time”. On the tarmac we had asked him, one last time, about waning Democratic support. This time, he answered back: “I’m doing well”. It wasn’t quite what we had asked, not really. Maybe he misheard us, or maybe he meant he believed he could survive it. It turns out he couldn’t.

638,The president's protectors are hardly noticeable - until things go wrong,"Within seconds of shots ringing out at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in western Pennsylvania, at least five protective agents in dark suits, white shirts and sunglasses sprinted into view. They leapt on stage where Trump stood, throwing themselves on top of him and shielding him from view, before ushering him into a waiting car. It looked like a picture of bravery, and of rigorous training. And yet, the near-miss that preceded the heroic scene is deemed by some to have been the worst security breach since the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. “It was a failed mission,” said Cheryl Tyler, a former Secret Service special agent and training instructor for the service. “It’s unacceptable.” President Joe Biden on Sunday called for an “independent review” of security measures at the rally. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Congress would conduct its own investigation into any “lapses” in security. And Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, has been called to testify before lawmakers at a hearing on Monday. But experts say last week’s episode will bring fresh scrutiny to the agency’s history, too, which includes a sometimes spotty record of mishaps and scandals that have risked the reputation of the presidents’ protectors. The Secret Service is tasked with a high-stakes and so-called zero-fail mission: to safeguard the US president, past presidents, presidential candidates and their families, at all costs. “The training is not easy. It’s rigorous and it’s long,” said Ms Tyler, who was the first black female agent assigned to a president’s protective service. “It’s not a 9 to 5 job. It is a lifestyle. It is a dedication to this country.” Since the 1968 assassination of Robert F Kennedy, who was shot and killed in the midst of his presidential campaign, the service has delivered on that high-stakes mission, she said. Those years of success allowed the agents to somewhat fade from view as only a quiet, stoic presence somewhere along the perimeter. “It’s almost as if you can forget about them when they’re doing their job,” said Matt Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University, who is writing a book on failed presidential assassination attempts. “But the Secret Service’s mistakes? Everyone learns about them.” And the agency has had its fair share of those. Beginning around 2011, the Secret Service suffered a series of lapses, ranging from the embarrassing to the downright alarming. In November that year, a man named Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired multiple shots from a semi-automatic rifle at the White House - meant to be one of the most closely-guarded properties in the world. And yet, the Secret Service was unaware for several days that at least seven bullets had hit the residence, while then-President Barack Obama’s daughter slept inside. In 2014, there was another major breach at the White House. Armed with a knife, Army veteran Omar Gonzalez jumped a fence onto the grounds and entered the White House through the front door and ran through much of the main floor before being tackled by an agent. A year later, in 2015, a drunk Secret Service agent drove a car through the White House compound, hitting a security barricade. In an unfortunate coincidence, security on the grounds had been on high-alert after someone had placed a package on the premises, and claimed it was a bomb. The drunk agent drove within inches of the suspicious package, according to a congressional report. And in another infamous episode from April 2012, reports emerged that several agents had solicited prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, ahead of then-President Barack Obama's visit.  Prostitution is legal in certain pockets of the country, but the incident - which reportedly followed a long night of heavy drinking - raised security and clearance concerns. It also added to the growing impression of the agency as a raucous fraternity, experts said.  A subsequent investigation by the House Oversight Committee found an email from a senior supervisor to 54 employees that his motto for the trip was “una mas cervesa por favor” - or, ""one more beer, please"". After an investigation, 10 agents were relieved from duty, with their security clearances revoked. By 2015, a House Oversight Committee report on the agency had declared it as being in crisis. “The incidents that we saw seemed like they were symptomatic of much larger problems at the Secret Service,” the report read.  “Wheels up, ring off”, was reportedly a running joke in the agency, meaning that on foreign assignments, marriage and other commitments were left behind at home. The atmosphere was demoralising for those agents who did work hard, according to the report. “For people who are serious about national security, about protection, [that reputation] is so embarrassing.” Experts say the attempted assassination of Donald Trump will force a reckoning. Ms Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, said ahead of the hearing that she would cooperate fully with any congressional or independent review into her agency. Director Cheatle “knows she’s going to be grilled”, said Ms Tyler, the former agent. “Records will be pulled, training records will be pulled, shooting records will be pulled, personnel actions will be pulled… They’re going to look at every single thing.” And the agency will be forced to reform, Ms Tyler said. “Will it be in the headlines of the newspaper? No, because they’re not going to tell you. But there will be changes.”",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16j896003xo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
636,What is Kamala Harris's 'brat' rebrand all about?,"Kamala Harris has overhauled her campaign's online presence by embracing a social media trend inspired by pop star Charli XCX's Brat album cover. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has scattered references to the album across her campaign's account, renaming her profile Kamala HQ.  Her rebrand comes as Charli showed her support by tweeting ""kamala IS brat"" shortly after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping out of the race for the White House and endorsed his vice-president.  By Monday morning, Ms Harris had seized on Charli's backing - with the account sporting a new lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.  Brat is the name of Charli's sixth studio album and her tweet about Vice-President Harris received almost nine million views in just four hours. The album's artwork is a lime green square with the word brat written in the middle in a low resolution Arial font.  Charli told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast that brat is a concept that represents a person who might have ""a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra"". It has been deemed by some pop critics as a rejection of the ""clean girl"" aesthetic popularised on TikTok, which spurned a groomed ideal of femininity, and instead embraces more hedonistic and rebellious attitudes. “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things some times,” Charli explained on social media.  “Who feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat.” The #bratsummer trend has nearly one million posts on TikTok and the lime green theme has been used by thousands of individuals and businesses.  In recent weeks - as pressure to drop out of the race grew on President Biden following several public errors - supporters of Ms Harris have been producing videos that combine clips of her speaking with songs from Charli's album.  One of the most recent viral videos shows Ms Harris telling a story about her mother during a White House event in 2023. She said: ""My mother used to - she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'  ""You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you."" Supporters of the vice-president are now posting memes of coconut trees.  Kamala HQ's X account has also started to repost memes (which often feature a recognisable image or video clip, paired with a witty caption or phrase) and swear words. In other words, Ms Harris is very much appealing to younger voters who now, thanks in part to Charli XCX, see her as the ""cool girl"" option.  On Sunday, just hours after Joe Biden announced that he was stepping down from the 2024 presidential race and would be endorsing Harris, the campaign officially filed to alter its name. Reflecting the change, the Biden-Harris campaign page on X implemented its new branding.  It was previously called Biden-Harris HQ and had leant heavily into internet memes about President Joe Biden.  New documents filed with the Federal Election Commission stated that the campaign would be known as 'Harris for President' and that Ms Harris would be conducting business as a presidential, not vice-presidential, candidate.",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqqlgq7k374o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
635,"Russians will be at the Olympics, but not in the medal table","There is a chance the medal table at Paris 2024 will not add up. That is because athletes from Russia and Belarus will be competing at the Olympics as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) and as well as not being allowed their national flags or anthems, they are also not going to be included in the official medal table. Russia and Belarus are banned from sending teams to the Games following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been supported by Belarus. But the countries are being invited to send individual athletes who meet strict criteria set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) relating to whether athletes support the war or have military links.   Russia has historically sent some of the largest contingents to the Olympics - even when competing at recent Games under sanctions imposed after a doping scandal - and is one of the medal-winning heavyweights.   But this time it will be very different. The IOC has invited just 36 Russian and 24 Belarusian athletes - of which only 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians have accepted the invitations. At Tokyo 2020, the Russian Olympic Committee sent 335 athletes and Belarus sent 101.  While Russia has said it was not planning to boycott the Games, its weightlifting federation has cited the ""unsportsmanlike selection principle"" in guiding its decision to turn down invitations for 10 athletes. Nine of those athletes initially accepted an invitation, according to the IOC. Its judo federation pointed to similar concerns, saying it would not accept the ""humiliating conditions"" and declined the invitation for its four athletes, one of whom the IOC listed as having initially accepted. So, how did we get to this point and what will the Olympics look like for the athletes who did accept? Athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports who have been eligible to compete as neutral athletes at Paris 2024 will participate as AINs (Individual Neutral Athlete or Athlete Individuel Neutre in French). It is the fourth successive Olympics where Russians are competing under an acronym. Before its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was already being sanctioned on the international sporting stage for a state-sponsored doping scandal. The last time it was able to compete at an Olympics under its own flag and with its own anthem was at the 2016 Rio Games. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Tokyo 2020 Summer Games, Russians who could prove they were clean competed as ROC (Russian Olympic Committee), while at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, they competed as OARs (Olympic Athletes of Russia). As ROC and OAR, they appeared as a group in the medal tables. But as AINs they will not - firstly because the IOC is not including their medals in their table of nations, but in any case they are individuals rather than a team. The IOC initially banned Russian and Belarusian athletes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Belarus is a close ally of Russia and supports its war in Ukraine. The IOC later decided athletes from the two countries would be able to participate as neutrals if they met strict eligibility conditions, saying that letting individuals take part was about ""respecting human rights"". Among the conditions are: Athletes must not actively support the war  Athletes must not be contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies (many Russian sports clubs have direct links to the military and security services) No teams are allowed Athletes had to qualify for the Games and then pass a double vetting check - first by their international sports federation and then by the IOC, which set up an Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel (AINERP) to evaluate eligibility against those conditions.  If they passed the checks, they were then invited by the IOC to participate at the Games. There will be no AIN track and field athletes because World Athletics has banned all Russians and Belarusians. The International Olympic Committee said last year it was expecting a maximum of 55 Russians and 28 Belarusians at Paris 2024, with 36 and 22 respectively the ""most probable scenario"". Just 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians have accepted invitations. That is in stark contrast to Tokyo 2020, where the ROC was one of the largest delegations with 335 competitors across 30 sports. They finished fifth in the medal table in Tokyo with 71 medals (20 gold, 28 silver, 23 bronze). Russia has dominated some events for many years and so the absence of so many of its competitors will open up chances for other countries.  This includes, for example, artistic swimming where Russians have won both the team and duet gold medals at the past six Games, and rhythmic gymnastics where Russia have won team and individual gold in five out of the past six Olympics.  Former world number one tennis player Daniil Medvedev is the most high-profile Russian set to take part. Also among the 15 Russians to accept an invitation are a further six tennis players, one trampoline gymnast, three canoeists, three road cyclists and one swimmer.  According to the IOC, nine of 10 invited wrestlers had initially accepted an invitation but have subsequently declined. The other declined immediately. Among the 21 to have turned down invitations are tennis players Andrey Rublev, Karen Khachanov and Daria Kasatkina and road cyclist Aleksandr Vlasov. Meanwhile, among the 17 Belarusians to accept an invitation is Ivan Litvinovich, who will be defending his men's trampoline title.  He is joined by another trampoline gymnast, three swimmers, two canoeists, two shooters, two rowers, two wrestlers, two weightlifters, one road cyclist and one taekwondo athlete. Among the seven Belarusians to have declined are two-time Grand Slam tennis champions Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka.  If an AIN is on the podium, the teal and white flag featuring the AIN logo will be raised at the medal ceremony.   Athletes may use this emblem on their kit, which must otherwise be white or unicolour.  The athletes cannot display any Russian or Belarusian colours, flags or emblems - and these are also banned from the venues.    You will not hear the Russian or Belarusian national anthems at medal ceremonies at Paris 2024. If an AIN wins gold then a specially written anthem with no lyrics will be played. No Russian or Belarusian government or state officials have been invited to or accredited for these Olympics. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last year that while he was in favour of Russians competing at the Games, a further assessment was needed of what the neutral status would mean for his country's athletes. ""If the IOC's artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all,"" he said. That was similar to the sentiment expressed by the Russian judo federation - a sport in which Putin himself is a black belt - when it said rejected any selection method ""aimed at... breaking the spirit of Russian athletes"". Russia has been critical of the IOC and its restrictions on its athletes, with its foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying the sporting body had ""slipped into racism and neo-Nazism"". When it announced its decision to allow AINs at the Games, the IOC said one of its considerations had been that an ""overwhelming majority of athletes"" did not want to ""punish fellow athletes for the actions of their government"". Ukraine's National Olympic Committee issued recommendations in May urging its athletes to avoid contact with Russians and Belarusians at Paris 2024 so that possible ""provocative actions"" can be prevented. Its recommendations also suggested Ukrainian athletes should not take part in news conferences or interviews with athletes from the two countries and to avoid being photographed with them at medal ceremonies.  Many Ukrainian athletes have already been avoiding handshakes with Russian and Belarusian opponents since the invasion.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last year that allowing Russia to compete at the Olympics would amount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable"", adding that there is no neutrality in sport while his country's athletes are dying on the battlefield. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said in March that Russian and Belarusian athletes were ""not welcome"" at the Games. The UK government, which had previously supported the IOC's ban on Russians and Belarusians, expressed support in April for the IOC's decision to allow them to compete in Paris as neutrals.",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0dd7j0l93yo,Sonia Oxley,2024-07-22 23:09:52,,True
647,James inspires USA to win against Germany in London,"LeBron James is a four-time NBA champion LeBron James scored 20 points for the United States as they beat Germany 92-88 in their final warm-up match before the Olympic Games. The 39-year-old produced 11 points of his game-high tally in the final four minutes as the USA survived a tough test at a sold-out O2 Arena in London. Germany led 71-68 at the end of the third quarter before James inspired the United States to victory.  He sank a three-pointer with one minute 26 seconds remaining to put the USA 90-86 up, then added two more points to give them a 92-86 lead on the way to the win. Joel Embiid scored 15 points and Stephen Curry 13 against Germany in a victory which means the United States have won all five of their pre-Olympic exhibition games. ""It was a good test for us. And I'm glad we were able to once again keep our composure, persevere like we did the other day versus South Sudan,"" said James, who will be a flagbearer for Team USA at Friday's Olympic Games opening ceremony. The USA are targeting a fifth consecutive men's basketball gold medal at this summer's Olympics in Paris, with their 12-man squad filled with some of the NBA's greatest talents. ""Now it's obviously a matter of showing up when the lights are bright next week,"" Curry said. ""I think we're ready. I think we're prepared. Now we have to perform."" They begin their Olympics campaign against Serbia (28 July), before facing South Sudan (31 July) and Puerto Rico (3 August). Sam Harris, BBC Sport Despite winning both exhibition games in London, Team USA have work to do. World champions Germany made a statement by forcing the US into unnecessary turnovers, regaining possession and punishing them for it. This lack of focus will undoubtedly frustrate the coaches, despite some defensive improvements in other coverages seen from the game against South Sudan. But does any of that matter if you have LeBron James on your team? He'll be carrying the US flag on Friday, but against Germany he carried the entire team when needed. At 39, James lit up the O2 Arena, igniting the crowd with an opening dunk that set the tone for the night. Down the stretch, as he did against South Sudan, James took over. Team USA’s final 11 points were all courtesy of the four-time gold medallist, who ended the night with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists. Powering past German defenders to score in the paint and showcasing his finesse with a three-pointer as the clock hit two minutes, the British crowd erupted in applause for 'the King.' James has aged like the finest of wines, growing even more valuable with time.

649,Australia would not pick convicted rapist Olympian,"Steven van de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 A convicted rapist would not be picked for the Australian Olympics team, says chief Anna Meares after Steven van de Velde was named in the Netherlands beach volleyball squad for Paris 2024. Van de Velde, now 29, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty to raping a 12-year-old British girl when he was 19. The Dutchman, who met his victim on Facebook, travelled from Amsterdam to the UK and raped the girl at an address in Milton Keynes. Van de Velde resumed his volleyball career after serving just 12 months of his four-year sentence and was selected in June for the Dutch Olympic team for Paris. While unwilling to specifically discuss another team's selection, Meares says a convicted rapist would not be selected for Australia. ""If an athlete or staff member had that conviction they would not be allowed to be a member of our team,"" Meares said.  ""We have stringent policies on safeguarding within our team."" Following his initial selection for Paris, the Dutch Olympic Committee (NOC) told BBC Sport: ""After his release, Van de Velde sought and received professional counselling. He demonstrated to those around him - privately and professionally - self-insight and reflection."" The NOC says Van de Velde's return to the sport met guidelines set by the Dutch Volleyball Federation (NeVoBo) in the organisation's ""Guidelines Integrity Record"", which sets out conditions for athletes to resume competing after conviction. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the selection of athletes for the Games was the responsibility of individual committees.  According to Dutch outlet NL Times,, external Van de Velde will not stay in the athletes' village and has instead been provided with alternative accommodation in Paris.  Van de Velde's inclusion in the Games has been criticised by women's safety groups.

651,'Schauffele passes ultimate examination in classic Open',"This video can not be played Schauffele wins The Open While Xander Schauffele celebrates completing the first American shutout of the four men's majors in 42 years, it is worth reflecting on the maddening magnificence of UK links golf at its highest level. It is, undoubtedly, the sport in its purest and best form. Schauffele won a classic Open at Royal Troon - a course that provided the ultimate test while the elements, for sustained periods, threw their worst at the world's finest golfers. Ultimately the championship was won by the right man, as the 30-year-old Olympic champion collected his second major of 2024. For all Scottie Scheffler's recent success, Schauffele richly deserves the moniker 'champion golfer of the year'. This Open had everything - unlikely challengers, big-name casualties and a stunning performance to snatch the Claret Jug. Those four days on the Ayrshire coast amounted almost to a different sport compared with the sultry heat and generous course set-up that prevailed at Valhalla in May, when Schauffele won the US PGA to land his first major title. Troon provided the ultimate examination.  The unfamiliar winds of the first two days undid the maxim that scores are made on the front nine and retained, if you are good enough, on the ultra-challenging inward half. The traditional Troon test was turned on its head. These unexpected conditions bamboozled the likes of Rory McIlroy, and the man who dramatically beat him to last month's US Open - Bryson DeChambeau. Much-vaunted debutant Ludwig Aberg also took an early bath as shot-making limitations of many top stars were ruthlessly exposed. Formulaic demands of the PGA Tour, where bomb and gouge to receptive greens is such a profitable pursuit, were not the qualities required last week. Deep bunkers with steep faces terrorised this Open field.  Shots needed shaping to use winds as cushions to land balls in correct spots. Chips from tight links turf required absolute precision, often putters were the correct option.  Keeping the ball low, imaginatively using this glorious golfing terrain was the order of the day. Maintaining mental fortitude as cold rain drove sideways late on the Saturday afternoon was crucial to ensuring title hopes were not blown away. These are the demands of golf in its purest form. Justin Rose and Billy Horschel - the 54-hole leader - played as if their lives depended on it - celebrating par putts that kept them prominent on the distinctive yellow leaderboards overlooking the home green. Shane Lowry raged at the tough course set-up.  The fact drivers were needed to reach the green on the long par-three 17th was irksome to the Irishman. He did little wrong in the Saturday 77 that ultimately cost him his tilt at a second Open title. And he had a point, to an extent. But with modern ball and club technology available to today's superstars, it was refreshing to see them tested to the extreme. And it was his cold putter on that frigid late Saturday afternoon that did for him. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from the 152nd Open Championship This was golf being played as the game's Scottish founding fathers experienced it back in the 19th Century, when the first Opens were played down the road at Prestwick. Schauffele was calmness personified throughout these four ultra-demanding days.  He carded only six bogeys, two of them in the worst of the third-round conditions. Stay out of the bunkers was a key maxim. He visited only three, and successfully got up and down on two of those occasions. Do not fall foul of the tiny Postage Stamp eighth was another. He birdied it three times, and will feel he should have had a full set having given himself a great look on his final visit to that magical par three. With the title on the line he hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation. He was the only man to birdie the treacherous 11th, where his six-iron approach from the left rough to inside three feet was arguably the shot of the tournament. His delicate chip to the par-five 16th was a shot of sheer class, having seen his plucky pursuer Rose smash a 300-yard driver off the deck on to the green. The Englishman was one poor pitch - at the 12th - from pushing Schauffele all the way to the end. His five on that hole was the only bogey between them in a fabulous display of links golf. Easing away with his four back-nine birdies, the champion demonstrated supreme ball-striking and clinical putting. That is champion golf, worthy of the greatest event on the calendar. ""That walk up 18 truly is the coolest with the yellow leaderboards and the fans and the standing ovation,"" Schauffele reflected as he tightly clutched the precious Claret Jug. ""It really is one of the coolest feelings I've ever had in my life."" Schauffele is the only player to have finished top 10 in all four majors. At the PGA he set a new scoring record by finishing 21 under par, but his nine-under tally in Scotland was even more impressive. He is the 11th successive first-time winner of the Open - a run started when Phil Mickelson made a similar bolt from the pack in 2013. Such a record shows the championship is truly 'open' and rewards the best player in that given week. That is competitive golf in a nutshell. Schauffele was already one of the two best players in the world, and the time-honoured demands of links golf - in its most hostile form - ensured that only someone of such elevated status could prevail. The 152nd Open should be remembered as a classic.

653,US Secret Service boss resigns over Trump shooting failures,"US Secret Service director Kim Cheatle has resigned after security failures surrounding an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. ""As your director, I take full responsibility for the security lapse,"" Ms Cheatle said in a resignation letter to agency staff on Tuesday.  She had faced calls from both Democrats and Republicans to step down after a contentious House committee hearing on Monday about the incident. Lawmakers became increasingly frustrated when she refused to answer questions about the shooting at Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this month.  In her resignation letter, Ms Cheatle said she had always ""put the needs of the agency first"" and it was “with a heavy heart” that she made her decision.  “The scrutiny over the last week has been intense and will continue to remain as our operational tempo increases,” she said. “I do not want my calls for resignation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you do towards our vital mission.” President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was grateful for her decades of public service.  ""The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again,"" he said.  Mr Biden said he would appoint a new director soon. For now, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has  appointed Ronald Rowe as acting director of the agency.  Mr Rowe, a 24-year Secret Service veteran, has held the position of deputy director since April 2023.  The president appointed Ms Cheatle to head the Secret Service - which oversees the protection of current and former presidents and other officials - in 2022. She had previously served 27 years at the agency in various roles.  During her time as an agent, Ms Cheatle was involved in evacuating then Vice-President Dick Cheney from the White House during the 11 September 2001 attacks. She later went on to become supervisor of Mr Biden’s protective detail when he was vice-president, before she became the deputy assistant director of protective operations. But her leadership came under question after the shooting at Trump's 13 July rally, where a bullet grazed the former president's ear.  The attack left one audience member dead and two others badly wounded.  Lawmakers questioned Ms Cheatle about security preparations ahead of the campaign rally during the tense six-hour House Oversight Committee hearing.  Ms Cheatle took responsibility for the security lapses, but pushed back on calls to resign.  She called the shooting ""the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades"".  Witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man - suspect Thomas Matthew Crooks - with a rifle on a rooftop at the rally minutes before shots were fired.  Crooks was killed by a counter sniper shortly after. Security and law enforcement officers from a number of different agencies were present at the rally.  During her testimony, Ms Cheatle didn't offer lawmakers any new information on how Crooks was able to access the roof where he was perched and why Trump was allowed to take the stage. After the hearing, the leading Republican and Democrat from the committee - James Comer and Jamie Raskin - sent a letter to Ms Cheatle that laid out their belief that she should step down. Mr Comer said Ms Cheatle “instilled no confidence” during the hearing that she can fulfill the Secret Service’s protective mission. “The Oversight Committee’s hearing resulted in Director Cheatle’s resignation and there will be more accountability to come,” he said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. In a post on his social media platform on Tuesday, Trump said: ""The Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy."" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called her resignation “overdue” and said he was ""glad she did the right thing"".  ""Now we have to pick up the pieces, we have to rebuild the American people's faith and trust in the Secret Service,"" he told reporters.  Teresa Wilson, an ex-marine who attended the rally, told the BBC that she was ""glad [Ms Cheatle] succumbed to the pressure"".   ""I hope they still follow through with the independent investigation now that she's resigned. We want answers,"" she said.

659,How retired Australian striker earned Olympic comeback,"Five years ago, Australian striker Michelle Heyman retired from international football with a little more than a whimper. But on Thursday, the 36-year-old will walk onto the field with the Matildas as they open their Olympic campaign, a feat being called one of the greatest comebacks in Australian sport. After a record-breaking performance in the domestic football league this season, where she became the first A-League Women (ALW) player to ever surpass 100 goals, Heyman caught the eye of a Matildas coach desperate to fill the hole left by an injured Sam Kerr. But not only is Heyman back in the squad, she is being seen as Australia’s best shot at finding the net in France. ""There’s always some haters thinking I'm too old to be back,"" she told the BBC before the tournament. ""But it's kind of fun to prove points to people... age is just a number."" Much like her return to the team in 2024, it was a stellar performance in the A-League – Australia’s domestic football offering – which catapulted a 21-year-old Heyman into the national team back in 2010. Heyman would go on to play 61 games and score 20 goals for the Matildas, including appearances at the 2015 World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics, but her early international career was marred by constant struggle. The Matildas of that era were paid miserably and worked under constant fear and stress, a team culture allegedly so toxic it resulted in the sacking of coach Alen Stajcic in early 2019. But if there was little support from officials, there was even less from the public. Many of the Matildas games weren’t even open to spectators – the cost would outweigh ticket sales. And then there were Heyman’s battles with both her physical and mental health: in interviews she spoke about anxiety and regular panic attacks, then back-to-back ankle and knee injuries which only made them worse. By May 2019, Heyman was burnt out, injured and stressed. Her starting position on the team was long gone and she hadn’t played even a minute in six months. ""I really wanted to fight [on]… but my body isn't going to allow me to do that. My mind isn't going to allow me to do that,"" Heyman told Fox Sports when announcing her retirement from international football. She’d achieved everything she set out to, except an Olympic gold medal, she said. Years later she would admit she was trying to save face, telling Australian media she was actually dropped from the team. ""I had to just pretend that I wanted to retire but it was mainly because I got fired,"" she told Code Sports. Heyman was so shattered she also exited the A-League and it seemed like the final pages of her storied career had been written. But just 18 months later, a recharged Heyman returned to the A-League in a blaze of glory, netting a hat-trick in her first match back for Canberra United. ""I missed being part of something bigger than myself,"" she said at the time. Since then, she has overtaken Kerr as the leading ALW goal scorer and become the first to earn a third Golden Boot award. These achievements, combined with her two Julie Dolan medals - the competition’s highest honour - arguably make her the league’s most decorated player. So when Olympic selection came around, Heyman was ready and waiting, at the top of her game. ""She's in tremendous form, she's scoring for fun,"" head coach Tony Gustavsson said in February when recalling her to the squad. The announcement quickly made waves around the country. ""Just quietly, this might be one of Australian sport’s greatest comeback stories in recent memory,"" wrote Sydney Morning Herald football journalist Vince Rugari.  ""Was it something that I thought would ever happen again? Probably not,"" Heyman says with a smile. ""I still remember the day - just like, tears. And I don't cry!” Adding to the emotion is the fact the country she’s playing for barely resembles the one she competed for just five years ago. The Matildas are the hottest sporting team in Australia, more well liked and well known than even the Australian men’s cricket team, experts say. Players are now household names, every match on home soil since the start of the World Cup has sold out and they hold the record for the most watched television event in Australian history. It’s hard to reconcile that with Heyman’s debut on ""a back field in Queensland somewhere"". ""I reckon there was 12 people at the game, if we were lucky,"" she says. ""And then now you look at it and our last game, 77,000 people [have] come, cheering you on. That's the feeling that I wanted for so many years, and it's something that I never thought was ever going to happen in Australia."" That awe and a bittersweet joy has rippled through the previous ranks of Matildas too, she says. ""I bring that emotion from every other ex-player, and I want to do it for them. I want to show them 'look what we all created'."" Does that – and the spectre of Kerr, the nation’s biggest sporting idol – add to the pressure to perform in France? Heyman answers with a confident no. She and Kerr are ""very different"" forwards but can both deliver, she says. In her few months back in the team, she has already scored six goals, twice as many as any of her teammates over the same period. ""I don't think anyone remembers the other, numerous amounts of goals I've scored for Australia, because they were done back in the day when no one cared about them,” she says with a chuckle. ""[But] I'm good at my job, and I'll continue to work hard and to win games."" Hard work will certainly be required. The Matildas have drawn a difficult group – going up against the powerhouse USA team, Rio 2016 gold medallists Germany, and Zambia for the two guaranteed spots in the next round. The team has also suffered a slew of injuries. Apart from Kerr, co-captain Steph Catley and key winger Caitlin Foord have both been under a cloud the past month. And midfielder Katrina Gorry and defender Clare Hunt have only just returned from injury. And though their World Cup campaign - most of which Kerr spent on the bench – would argue otherwise, pundits say the team often struggles to perform without her. So what does Heyman say to the people who have already written the Matildas off? ""They can be quiet,"" she says cheekily. ""The more people we have supporting us the better we're going to do. ""And we're doing it for you - we're playing to win for our country.""",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clmy2yppmmjo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
658,Kamala Harris slams Trump at first rally as he hits back,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has gone on the offensive against Donald Trump in the first rally of her White House campaign, portraying November’s election as one between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon. Speaking to a crowd of thousands in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Ms Harris likened her Republican opponent to fraudsters she said she had prosecuted. Trump, meanwhile, assailed her work on the border, and posted on social media: “Lyin’ Kamala Harris destroys everything she touches!” It comes a day after she secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates, paving the way for her to become the party's nominee. On Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race and endorsed his vice-president amid mounting pressure from top Democrats and donors following his disastrous debate against Trump in late June. The fledgling Harris campaign raised a staggering $100m plus (£77m) in the 36 hours after Mr Biden’s exit. Adding to her momentum, a new national poll from Reuters and Ipsos shows her with a two-point lead over Trump, 44% to 42%. Taking the stage to applause at a high school in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Ms Harris highlighted her experience as California's attorney general. ""I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” she said. “Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.” ""So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type,"" Ms Harris added. ""In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week."" In response, the crowd shouted ""Kamala! Kamala!"" Some observers noted that the audience's enthusiasm contrasted with that seen at Biden events this electoral cycle. Trump, meanwhile, posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, about a poll finding that Ms Harris was the most unpopular vice-president in US history. He also shared a post noting that she was rated by the non-partisan congressional scorekeeper GovTrack as one of the most left-wing among dozens of Democratic senators during her tenure. Ms Harris laid out a number of policy priorities in her speech, including tackling child poverty, union rights, affordable healthcare and being able to ""retire with dignity"". She also focused on gun control and abortion access, vowing to stop Trump's ""extreme abortion bans, because we must trust women to make decisions about their own body”. The Republican party platform, approved by Trump, does not advocate for any abortion restrictions at the federal level, instead leaving the matter up to individual US states to decide. The Trump campaign is focusing on Ms Harris' ""failure"" to stem a record influx of illegal immigrants at the US-Mexico border. A Tuesday afternoon email from the Republican nominee’s team accused her of bailing out ""accused murderers, rapists and other violent offenders"", insulting Israel and deceiving the US public about Mr Biden's ""cognitive decline"". During a call with reporters, Trump said of Ms Harris: ""She's a radical left person, but this country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it. ""I think she should be easier than Biden, because he was slightly more mainstream, but not much."" Trump also said he was open to debating her in September, when he was originally due to face Biden on ABC News. ""I haven't agreed to anything,” he said. “I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden. But I want to debate her. She'll be no different."" In Washington, a Republican member of the US House of Representatives introduced articles of impeachment against Ms Harris. The resolution, written by Tennessee's Andy Ogles, accuses her of high crimes and misdemeanours over her handling of immigration at the border.

666,Netanyahu faces delicate balancing act in US after Biden exits race,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the US this week under pressure to end the Gaza war, from both Israelis and the US administration. How might the political turbulence in Washington shape the trip and future relations? Mr Netanyahu is set to meet Joe Biden – if the president has recovered from Covid-19 – and address a joint session of Congress, the only foreign leader to do so for a fourth time. The trip offers him a platform for a reset with Washington after months of tensions over his hardline approach to the war, and an opportunity to try and convince Israelis that he hasn’t undermined relations with their most important ally. But it is overshadowed by President Biden’s decision not to seek re-election, highlighting political uncertainties about Israel’s next partner in the White House and possibly eclipsing some of the attention on Mr Netanyahu’s visit. The prime minister got a lot of unwelcome attention in Israel until the moment he boarded the plane. A drumbeat of protests demanded that he stay home and focus on a ceasefire deal with Hamas to free Israeli hostages. “Until he has signed the deal that's on the table, I do not see how he picks up and flies across the Atlantic to address the American political chaos,” said Lee Siegel, one of the family members who has come out to demonstrate. His 65-year-old brother Keith is a captive in Gaza. The trip is a political move, he added, unless Mr Netanyahu stops being a “hurdle” and signs the ceasefire agreement. Mr Siegel reflected a widespread view that Mr Netanyahu is slow-rolling the process for his own political reasons, roiling his negotiators when he recently threw new conditions into talks that seemed to be making progress. The prime minister has been accused of bowing to pressure from two far-right cabinet ministers who’ve threatened to bring down his government if he makes concessions to Hamas. These perceptions have added to frustrations in the White House, which announced the latest formula for talks and had been expressing optimism an agreement could be achieved. Mr Biden remains one of the most pro-Israel presidents to sit in the Oval Office, a self-declared Zionist who’s been lauded by Israelis for his support and empathy, cemented by his flight to Israel just days after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. But since then, he’s grown alarmed at the cost of Mr Netanyahu’s demand for a “total victory” against Hamas in Gaza. The administration is frustrated with the Israeli prime minister for rejecting a post war solution that involves pursuing a Palestinian state. It’s angry with him for resisting appeals to do more to protect Palestinian civilians and increase the flow of aid to them. It’s facing a domestic backlash over the mounting death toll in Gaza. And it’s worried that the conflict is spreading to the region. As Joe Biden’s presidency weakened in the swirl of controversy over his abilities, analysts said there might be less room for him to keep up the pressure on the Israeli prime minister. But Mr Biden’s decision to drop out of the race could actually have strengthened his hand, says Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and a critic of Mr Netanyahu. “He is not a lame duck in regard to foreign policy, in a way he's more independent (because) he doesn't have to take into account any impact on the voters,” Mr Barak told the BBC.  “With regard to Israel probably he feels more of a free hand to do what really needs to be done.” Mr Barak believes it was a mistake for Congress to invite Mr Netanyahu to speak, saying that many Israelis blame him for policy failures that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, and three out of four want him to resign. “The man does not represent Israel,” he said. “He lost the trust of Israelis…And it kind of sends a wrong signal to Israelis, probably a wrong signal to Netanyahu himself, when the American Congress invites him to appear as if he is saving us.” Whatever politics he may be playing, Mr Netanyahu insists military pressure must continue because it has significantly weakened Hamas after a series of strikes against the military leadership. In comments before departing Israel, he suggested that would be the tone of his meeting with President Biden. “It will also be an opportunity to discuss with him how to advance in the months ahead the goals that are important for both our countries,” he said, “achieving the release of all our hostages, defeating Hamas, confronting the terror axis of Iran and its proxies and ensuring that all Israel’s citizens return safely to their homes in the north and in the south.” He’s expected to bring the same message to congress, “seeking to anchor the bipartisan support that is so important to Israel”. The reality is that Mr Netanyahu’s policies have dented that bipartisan support. The Republicans are rallying around him, but criticism from Democrats has grown. The Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer caused a small earthquake in Washington recently when he stood up in the chambers and said Mr Netanyahu was one of the obstacles standing in the way of a lasting peace with Palestinians. “I hope the prime minister understands the anxiety of many members in congress and addresses them,” the former US ambassador to Israel, Thomas Nides, told the BBC at the weekend. He’d been addressing one of the many rallies demanding a hostage release. That includes “on humanitarian issues and to articulate that this fight isn’t with the Palestinian people, it’s with Hamas."" It’s a message that Kamala Harris would repeat if she were to become the Democratic nominee. There’d be no change in US policy: a commitment to Israel’s security while pushing for an end to the Gaza conflict and a plan for the Day After embedded in a regional peace with Arab states. But there might be a difference in tone. Ms Harris does not share Mr Biden’s long history with and emotional ties to Israel. She’s from a different generation and “could more closely align with the sentiments of younger elements of the Democratic party,"" says Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East. ""That’s a stance more likely to include restrictions on weapons, on munitions from the United States for use in Gaza,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu could very well use the visit to steer the conversation from the controversy over Gaza to the threat from Iran, a topic with which he’s far more comfortable, especially after the recent escalation with Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. But his main audience will be domestic, says Tal Shalev, the diplomatic correspondent at Israel’s Walla News. He wants to revive his image as “Mr America,” she says, the man who can best present Israel to the US, and to restore his image which was shattered by the October 7 attacks. “When he goes to the US and speaks in front of Congress and [has] a meeting in the White House, for his electoral base, it's the old Bibi is back again,” she says, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “This is not the failed Bibi who was responsible for the seventh of October. This is the old Bibi who goes to the Congress and gets the standing ovations.” It also gives him an opportunity to pursue connections with the former President Donald Trump at a time of great political flux in Washington. “Netanyahu wants President Trump to win,” she says, “And he wants to make sure that he and President Trump are on good terms before the election.” There is a widespread view that Mr. Netanyahu is playing for time, hoping for a Trump win that might ease some of the pressure he’s been facing from the Biden administration. “There is a near-universal perception that Netanyahu is eager for a Trump victory, under the assumption that he will then be able to do whatever he wants,” writes Michael Koplow of Israel’s Policy Forum. “No Biden pressuring him on a ceasefire or on West Bank settlements and settler violence... There are many reasons to doubt this reading of the landscape under a Trump restoration, but Netanyahu likely subscribes to it.” The question is whether that pressure from Biden will ease as he steps away from the presidential race, or whether he will in fact use his remaining months in office to focus on achieving an end to the Gaza war.",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978qzgnd25o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
669,Has Kamala Harris got what it takes to beat Trump?,"The path for Vice-President Kamala Harris to secure the Democratic presidential nomination is clearing. That may end up being the easy part. The most formidable challenge – defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November – is still to come. Her elevation to the top of ticket would bring new strengths for the Democrats, but it also exposes weaknesses that were less of a concern with Mr Biden. According to recent polls, Ms Harris trails the former president slightly – a roughly similar position to the one Mr Biden found himself in before his historic announcement. But there may be more room for those numbers to shift as we move from a hypothetical matchup to a very real one. For at least a moment, Democrats have a jolt of energy after more than three weeks of intense hand-wringing over the president’s fitness and ability to sustain his campaign.  All of Ms Harris’s leading potential rivals for the nomination have endorsed her, as has former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi – who remains one of the most influential players in Democratic politics. This is, still, shaping up to be a tight race in November - a condition that reflects deep partisan trenches in American politics and the distaste many voters have for Trump as a candidate.  The vice-president’s primary challenge – and opportunity - will be to capitalise on this Trump aversion, attract centrist voters in key swing states and energise the Democratic base, which was in the past few weeks swinging towards despair, to match the enthusiasm many on the right hold for the former president. This renewed sense of Democratic presidential enthusiasm comes with a dollar sign attached. According to the Harris campaign, the vice-president raised more than $80m (£62m) in new donations in the 24 hours since Mr Biden’s announcement – the biggest one-day total of any candidate this election cycle. That, along with the nearly $100m she inherits from the Biden-Harris fundraising coffers, gives her a firm financial footing for the campaign to come. Ms Harris, if she becomes the nominee, also defuses one of the most effective attacks the Republicans have levelled against their opponent: his age.  For months, the Trump campaign has been pounding Mr Biden for being feeble and easily confused – characterisations that were reinforced for many Americans after the president’s halting debate performance four weeks ago. The vice-president, at age 59, will be a more energetic campaigner and able to make a more coherent case for her party. She could also turn the 78-year-old Trump’s age against him, as he would become the oldest person ever elected president. Ms Harris may also be able to shore up support from black voters, who polls indicate had been drifting away from Mr Biden in recent months. If she can combine that with more backing from other minorities and younger voters – Barack Obama’s winning coalition from 2008 and 2012 – it could help her gain ground against Trump in the handful of swing states that will decide this year’s election. Her background as a prosecutor could also burnish tough-on-crime credentials. While her law-enforcement resume was a liability when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 – and led to derisive “Kamala is a cop” attacks from the left – it could help her in a campaign against Trump.   The vice-president has also been the administration’s point person on abortion, which has proven to be one of the most potent issues for motivating the Democratic base in recent elections. Mr Biden, by contrast, sometimes had been a reluctant advocate on the issue, hampered by a past record of supporting some limits on the procedure. “I think she reminds suburban women across the country, particularly in those battleground states, of what's at stake with reproductive rights,” former New York congressman Steve Israel, who headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told the BBC’s Americast podcast.  ""We have established a fundamental reset in the campaign.” For all Harris’s potential strengths, there is a reason why some Democrats were initially reluctant to push Mr Biden to step aside, given that his running mate would be the clear successor. Despite generating Democratic enthusiasm on the subject of abortion, Ms Harris's record as vice-president has been mixed. Early in the administration, she was set the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border. A number of missteps and misstatements - including a ham-handed June 2021 interview with NBC News presenter Lester Holt – damaged her standing and opened her to conservative attacks. Republicans are already condemning her as the president’s “border czar”, attempting to make her the face of what public opinion polls have found is the Biden administration's unpopular immigration policies. “Immigration is a soft spot for Democrats in those battleground areas,” Mr Israel said. “This is a very salient issue for voters living in those suburbs, fairly or unfairly. They believe that our immigration system is not managed strongly enough.” The Trump campaign will also try to turn the vice-president’s prosecutorial background against her – both by highlighting the former president’s record of enacting criminal justice reform and by attacking her past prosecutorial and parole decisions. Another Harris vulnerability is her chequered track record as a candidate. In her 2016 Senate bid, she faced only token opposition from Republicans in deeply Democratic California.  Her one solo run for national office – a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – ended in ruins. While she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primary contests. Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ms Harris is that, unlike the president, she is not the incumbent. While she might have the opportunity to distance herself from some of the more unpopular elements of Mr Biden’s record, she also does not have the luxury of being a known quantity for voters. Expect a furious effort by Republicans to paint Ms Harris as too untested and too risky to be president. In effect, Trump now has a greater claim to being the only proven commodity. The vice-president has a chance, in the days ahead, to make a new first impression with the American public. If she stumbles out of the gate, it could open the door to an extended power struggle that stretches into the Democrat’s national convention in late August. They could end up with the party uniting behind a different candidate – or tearing itself apart. As the past four weeks have shown, fortunes in the White House race can shift quickly and permanently. Ms Harris has punched her ticket to the biggest stage in American politics – now she has to show she can compete.",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c035dp3glypo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
676,American rapper Snoop Dogg to carry Olympic torch,"Snoop Dogg was born in Los Angeles - the host city for the 2028 Olympics American rapper Snoop Dogg has been named as one of the final torchbearers of the Olympic flame before Friday's opening ceremony in Paris. The 52-year-old will carry the torch through the streets of Saint-Denis in the north of Paris, which is home to the Stade de France Olympic Stadium, on Friday. The Saint-Denis stretch is the penultimate leg of the flame's journey before the relay ends at the Eiffel Tower. The Olympic torch has crossed France since starting its journey in May and has been carried by a host of different personalities, including former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, Formula One driver Charles Leclerc and actress Halle Berry. Snoop Dogg, whose full name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, was born in Los Angeles - the host city for the 2028 Games. The US artist will be joined by fellow torchbearers in Saint-Denis, including French actress Laetitia Casta and French rapper MC Solaar. When do the Olympics start?

678,GB's Dujardin provisionally banned and out of Olympics after video emerges,"Dujardin won team and individual gold medals at the London 2012 Games Charlotte Dujardin, Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian, has been provisionally suspended by equestrian's governing body the FEI. The dressage star had already pulled out of Paris 2024 after a video emerged which she said showed her ""making an error of judgement"". The FEI said it had received footage showing three-time Olympic gold medallist Dujardin ""engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare - during a training session conducted at Ms Dujardin's private stable"". A lawyer representing the claimant who filed an official complaint against Dujardin to the FEI said in an accompanying letter seen by the BBC ""the video shows Ms Dujardin beating a horse excessively with a whip"". They added: ""My client is aware that this complaint could have far-reaching consequences for Ms Dujardin, including disciplinary sanctions. My client had to think long and hard about whether to bring this to your attention this way."" BBC Sport has not seen the video in question. However the FEI said Dujardin confirmed she was the individual in the video which was ""filmed several years ago"" and ""requested to be provisionally suspended pending the outcome of the investigations"". The body initially announced a six-month suspension but later said the ban would ""remain in place pending the outcome of the investigation/disciplinary proceedings"". Although the ban remains provisional while the FEI investigates, Dujardin, who has six Olympic medals in total, has said she will ""withdraw from all competition while this process takes place"". ""What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse,"" she said in statement. ""I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment."" Both the British Equestrian (BEF) and British Dressage (BD) have also imposed a provisional suspension on Dujardin pending the outcome of the FEI investigation. In a statement the FEI added it ""intends to proceed [its investigation] as swiftly as possible"". ""It is our responsibility and crucial that we address any instances of abuse, as equine welfare cannot be compromised,"" said FEI president Ingmar De Vos. ""Charlotte [Dujardin] has expressed genuine remorse for her actions, and we recognise and appreciate her willingness to take responsibility.  ""Despite the unfortunate timing, we believe this action reaffirms the FEI's commitment to welfare as the guardians of our equine partners and the integrity of our sport."" At the last Olympics in Tokyo in 2021, German modern pentathlon coach Kim Raisner was disqualified from the Games for appearing to punch a horse. That incident sparked a major overhaul of the event with the equestrian element replaced by an obstacle course. Becky Moody and her horse Jagerbomb are Team GB's alternate combination for the dressage. The British Olympic Association (BOA) said it ""will be applying to bring in a reserve athlete under the IOC's Late Athlete Replacement rules"". It added: ""The BOA takes animal welfare extremely seriously, and we believe that everyone has a responsibility for ensuring the wellbeing of horses."" British Dressage chief executive Jason Brautigam said: ""These historic allegations are deeply upsetting for everyone involved in our sport, but we fully support the FEI investigation and will take any appropriate disciplinary action when this process is complete."" British Equestrian chief executive Jim Eyre said the BEF would ""fully comply with any [FEI] requests to fulfil their investigation"".  He added: ""As the guardians of equestrian sport, we must uphold the highest standards of equine welfare – the horse's wellbeing is paramount."" Roly Owers, chief executive of World Horse Welfare, said: ""We know that a successful future for horse sport has public trust at the centre of it. The public has to trust that equestrians are caring and are treating their horses with respect, compassion and understanding.  ""If that trust is damaged it will damage the sport. This is another massive wake-up call for anyone who thinks this is not important, because it most certainly is."" Dujardin, 39, won team and individual gold medals at the London 2012 Games on Valegro, and the pair went on to win individual gold and team silver four years later in Rio. On a different horse, Gio, she won two bronzes at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games. Dujardin had been set to compete in both the individual dressage and team event alongside Carl Hester and world champion Lottie Fry, on new horse Imhotep. She needed a medal of any colour to take the outright lead as most-decorated British female Olympian from now-retired cyclist Dame Laura Kenny. Speaking to BBC Sport last week, Dujardin said it felt ""surreal"" to be on the cusp of that achievement and doing so would be ""one of the most incredible moments"". Dressage is the oldest equestrian discipline, and sees rider and horse perform a series of movements to music across the gaits of walk, trot and canter. Analysis - Laura Scott, BBC Sport news correspondent  This news was shocking when it broke and caught a lot of people off guard within the British Olympic setup. It will undoubtedly rock the team with the Games just about to start. When I went to visit Dujardin at her yard in Gloucestershire three weeks ago, she was confident about making history in Paris and told me she wanted to make her young daughter proud. She was considered a gold medal contender both individually and with the team. Now she won't be at the Games at all. But beyond the impact on Team GB's medal hopes, this story could have major ramifications for the general acceptance of equestrian sport in society. She is one of the faces of British sport and animal welfare is a subject that draws intense scrutiny. With only three days before the opening ceremony, the timing of this couldn't be worse, and the consequences could be huge.

679,Police investigating 'gang rape' of Australian woman in Paris,"French police are investigating after an Australian woman said she was raped by five men in central Paris. The 25-year-old woman took refuge in a kebab shop in the Pigalle district on Saturday morning with her dress partially torn off, local media reported. No arrests have yet been made but prosecutors confirmed officers are treating the investigation as ""gang rape"". The incident happened just days before the opening of the 2024 Olympics in the French capital. According to French newspaper Le Parisien, restaurant owners called for help when they saw the woman's state.  She was looked after by firefighters following the alleged assault and was later taken to Bichat hospital to be examined by medical professionals. The Paris Prosecutor's Office said police were investigating the allegations and that CCTV footage was being looked at.  “The investigation into the charge of gang rape likely to have been committed on the night of 19 to 20 July has been entrusted to the second judicial police district,” it said. There is currently a huge police presence on the ground in Paris in order to maintain the safety of those in the city during the Olympics, which begin on Friday. Officers have been patrolling in big numbers since last week in Paris, with armed guards around the River Seine. Several security zones have also been set up around the city with Paris split into zones. Anyone wishing to enter certain zones, including the Eiffel Tower, will have to apply for a special games pass on a platform run by police.",2024-07-23 23:11:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6rkg75gko,Unknown,Unknown,,True
693,What's happening and when at the Paris Olympics?,"The live sport has started at the Paris Olympics so what better way to plan ahead than with our day-by-day guide - all times BST.  Team GB has named a squad of 327 athletes and UK Sport has set a target of 50 to 70 medals at the Games.  There will be live coverage of Paris 2024 across the BBC on TV, radio and online.  The Games will be officially opened at a unique and spectacular opening ceremony along the River Seine on Friday, 26 July and will close on Sunday, 11 August. Full Paris 2024 schedule All you need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympics Highlights The women’s football group stage begins. GB did not qualify via England as the nominated home nation and neither did Sweden, losing finalists at the last two Olympics. Defending champions Canada begin against New Zealand (16:00). Hosts France play Colombia at 20:00. The men’s sevens isn’t hanging around. A day before the opening ceremony, we’ll be into the quarter-finals by 20:00. Fiji have won both Olympic men’s titles so far. New Zealand, who were the losing finalists last time, play Ireland (15:30) in the day’s final pool game. Brit watch Team GB’s archers will take part in their sport’s ranking round for the individual events. This does not eliminate anyone, it is simply a preliminary stage that seeds the archers for the main competition. World watch Emma Hayes, who just left Chelsea after 12 years in charge, will coach the US women at Olympic level for the first time when they face Zambia at 20:00. The US won four of the first five Olympic women’s football titles but have only been on the podium once since 2012, a bronze medal in Tokyo.  Expert knowledge  The first handball games of Paris 2024 run throughout the day as the women’s event starts. France’s handball team have shown incredible progress, going from a nation that never qualified for this event to the silver medallists in Rio and champions in Tokyo. They are also the defending world champions after winning gold without losing any of their nine games last year. Under handball’s rules, France as hosts got to choose their group having seen who had already been drawn. They wisely opted to avoid Norway, Denmark and South Korea, who have collectively won seven of the past nine Olympic titles and are all in the other group. France instead begin their campaign against Hungary, who came through a qualifying tournament to bag one of the remaining places, at 18:00. This video can not be played New United States head coach Emma Hayes ready for the 'biggest job in women's football' Highlights Opening ceremony - 18:30, with BBC TV coverage beginning at 17:45.  Around 300,000 people will watch from the banks of the River Seine as a parade of some 10,000 athletes takes place not in a stadium, but on boats for each team. The ceremony finale will take place at the Trocadero. No Olympic Games has held an opening ceremony like this before, so expect something completely different.  The plan comes with logistical and security complications that have challenged organisers, who chose earlier this year to limit the number of spectators at the water’s edge.  There is no sport scheduled at the Games on Friday, clearing the path for the ceremony to be the centre of attention. Brit watch None in action. World watch None in action. Expert knowledge  More than 90 boats will be in use for the opening ceremony, carrying not only the athletes but also a range of performers that you will see throughout the evening. Theatre director Thomas Jolly, who is the show’s artistic director, has pointed out there is no way to fully rehearse the show on the river. Instead, parts of the ceremony have been practised inside giant hangars and the boat captains are reported to have been rehearsing at a sailing centre.

Highlights Road cycling’s time trial is a chance for Josh Tarling to get Team GB’s Olympics off to a flying start. The 20-year-old won the European title last year and is considered a contender in the men’s event, which for the first time at an Olympics uses the same course as the women’s, taking in sections of forest alongside Paris monuments like the Louvre and Eiffel Tower. The women’s time trial featuring GB’s Anna Henderson, a European silver medallist, starts at 13:30 with the men’s event at 15:34. In the swimming, Saturday night brings a hotly anticipated three or even four-way contest in the women’s 400m freestyle (19:55). US legend Katie Ledecky lost to Australia’s Ariarne Titmus in 2021 and Titmus won last year’s world title, too, while Canadian 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is the world record-holder. New Zealand’s Erika Fairweather is also expected to do well. The Brits have a shot at a medal in the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay (20:37). Adam Peaty will be competing in the 100m breaststroke heats (10:00). GB divers Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen go in the women’s 3m synchro from 10:00. They won world silver in 2023 behind China. Men’s rugby sevens is already on its final day. France will be hoping Antoine Dupont, who skipped the Six Nations to prepare for this, can lead the hosts to a famous title at the Stade de France. The final is at 18:45. Brit watch At the Palace of Versailles, Team GB begin their defence of the Olympic team eventing crown. Saturday is the dressage stage of eventing (from 08:30), which is followed by cross-country and finally showjumping. Tokyo champions Tom McEwen and Laura Collett are back in the line-up this time around, joined by European champion Ros Canter. The first hockey match of Paris 2024 features Team GB’s men versus Spain (09:00). Spain are ranked eighth in the world.

Yuto Horigome is back after winning gold on home soil three years ago, and he is joined by 2023 world champion Sora Shirai. French hopes rest with world number nine and 2022 world champion Aurelien Giraud. For the US, legend of the sport Nyjah Huston is hoping to make up for missing out on a medal in Tokyo. In judo (medal contests from 16:18), Georgia’s Giorgi Sardalashvili produced a stunning result in May to become world champion in the men’s -60kg division aged just 20. France’s Luka Mkheidze, the Tokyo bronze medallist, will be going up against him, as will Spanish 2023 world champion Francisco Garrigos. Roland-Garros, the home of the French Open, hosts this year’s Olympic tennis. It is possible that this could be the last major event for Spain’s Rafael Nadal, an Olympic singles and doubles champion, who enters both events this time and teams up with Carlos Alcaraz in the doubles. Novak Djokovic has also said he is prioritising the Olympics – one of the few tennis titles the Serb has never won. Expert knowledge If you have just hopped across the Channel to Paris hoping to catch some of the Olympic surfing, bad news: it is in Tahiti, which is 10,000 miles away. This breaks the record for the furthest an event has ever taken place from the host city of an Olympics. Tahiti’s Teahupo’o wave is considered world-class and Tahiti is part of French Polynesia, a semi-autonomous territory of France. The men’s and women’s first rounds take place on Saturday. The first gold medal of Paris 2024 is likely to be shooting’s mixed team air rifle. The gold-medal round begins at 10:00. Michael Bargeron and Seonaid McIntosh are the British entrants. Gold medal events: Archery (women's team), canoe slalom (women's K1), fencing (men's epee, women's foil), judo (W -52kg, M -66kg), mountain bike (women's cross-country), shooting (men and women's 10m air pistol), skateboard (women's street), swimming (men's 400m individual medley, women's 100m fly, men's 100m breast). Highlights Team GB’s Adam Peaty is expected to challenge for a third consecutive men’s 100m breaststroke Olympic title in Sunday’s final at 20:54. This time, he has described himself as “the person with the bow and arrow and not the one being fired at” after a foot injury and time away from the sport to focus on his mental health. He was third at the world championships in February. Watch for China’s Qin Haiyang and American Nic Fink in the same event. Meanwhile, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand should line up in the final of the men’s 400m individual medley at 19:30. Marchand is one of the biggest names on the hosts' Olympic team and is expected to end a 12-year French gold-medal drought in the pool. When he was younger, Marchand wrote to American great Michael Phelps’ former coach, Bob Bowman, to ask if Bowman would be his coach. Bowman said yes and Marchand now has five world titles at the age of 22. Team GB's Evie Richards, the 2021 world champion, features in the women’s cross-country mountain bike event from 13:10. Richards is coming back from a concussion suffered in Brazil two months ago, so does not start the race as a favourite, but is still ranked inside the world’s top 15. Switzerland’s Alessandra Keller is the world number one. Watch out for young Dutch star Puck Pieterse and France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prevot. Chelsie Giles is the headline act in GB’s judo squad for Paris 2024. The 27-year-old won bronze in Tokyo then added European gold and world silver a year later. Giles is in the -52kg class, which is packed with talent like Japan’s Uta Abe, who has proved a hard obstacle for Giles to overcome in the past and has been sweeping up medals lately. GB have won 20 Olympic medals in judo but never a gold, meaning there is history on the line. Women’s medal contests begin at 16:49. It is impossible to look past South Korea in most archery events. This includes the women’s team event, which they have won every time since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1988. Not only were none of the current GB team born then, but their coach was four years old. However, this GB team are made of strong stuff. Penny Healey and Bryony Pitman have each been ranked world number one in the past year, so this could be a real opportunity for them to shine. The event begins at 08:30 with the gold-medal match at 16:11. Brit watch Helen Glover, an Olympic rowing champion in 2012 and 2016, is back for her fourth Olympics. This time she is in the women’s four alongside returning Olympian Rebecca Shorten and debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave (no relation to Sir Steve). They only got together at the start of the year but were unbeaten at a string of major events in the first half of 2024. Sunday’s rowing begins at 08:00, with the women’s four heats from 11:30. At the women’s rugby sevens, Team GB face Ireland in the opening group game at 14:30. GB have finished fourth at the past two Olympics, whereas this is the Irish women’s Olympic debut. Ireland go on to play South Africa at 18:00, while GB play Australia at 18:30. Kimberley Woods will line up for GB in canoe slalom’s K1 event (starts 14:30, final at 16:45). Woods had a “heartbreaking” Tokyo Games, finishing 10th, but believes she has grown mentally and physically in the years since. She is a contender in both this event and the kayak cross, which is making its Olympic debut later in the Games. Eventing heads into its second day, the cross-country, from 09:30. This involves a gallop of nine to 10 minutes through the park at Versailles, twice crossing the centuries-old Grand Canal in what might be one of the Paris Olympics’ signature views. In women’s hockey, Team GB begin their campaign against Spain at 12:15. GB beat Spain in a quarter-final shootout in Tokyo before going on to win bronze. Later on Sunday, at 19:15, the GB men play their second group game against South Africa. World watch In gymnastics, it is the women’s turn to head through qualifying. Britain are again in the first subdivision at 08:30. The United States and China are in subdivision two from 10:40. Team GB’s women took team bronze in Tokyo three years ago. The US, who are the defending world champions, are led once again by Simone Biles – now competing in her third Olympic Games aged 27, with a coincidental total of 27 world and Olympic titles already won. Men’s water polo begins on Sunday and is part one of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. Water polo is often described as the national sport of Hungary, who won 2023’s world title and have nine Olympic gold medals in this event, although none since 2008. What better way to start than against the hosts? France have a tradition of winning the Olympic men’s water polo title whenever it’s held in Paris – which unfortunately for them has only happened once, a century ago. France play Hungary at 18:30. Expert knowledge In women’s street skateboarding, where teenagers are often contenders, France will be represented by 14-year-old Lucie Schoonheere. Nobody in the top 10 of this event’s world rankings heading into the Olympics is aged older than 19. Japan’s Coco Yoshizawa, also 14, is the world number one. The final begins at 16:00. No sport has provided France with more Olympic medals than fencing – 123 of them at the start of Paris 2024, 30 more than cycling in second place. This brings us to part two of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. If the Hungarians are the strong favourites against France in water polo, the men’s epee might give France more of a chance. Hungary’s Gergely Siklosi and Mate Koch are the world number one and two respectively, but when Siklosi lost the Olympic final in 2021, who beat him? France’s Romain Cannone. Cannone and veteran team-mate Yannick Borel are both in the world top five and on the team for Paris 2024. Japan and Italy will also be hoping to have a say. Expect the medal events in men’s epee and women’s foil from around 19:50. The young stars to follow at Paris 2024 This video can not be played Paris 2024: Adam Peaty watches emotional messages from family & friends Gold medal events: Archery (men's team), artistic gymnastics (men's team), canoe slalom (men's C1), diving (men's synchro 10m platform), equestrian (eventing jumping team, eventing jumping individual), fencing (men foil, women sabre), judo (W -57kg, M -73kg), mountain bike (men's cross-country), shooting (men's and women's 10m air rifle), swimming (women's 400m individual medley, men's 200m free, men's 100m back, women's 100m breaststroke, women's 200m free). Highlights  Tom Daley, now 30, is back for his fifth Olympic Games representing Team GB. He is paired with 24-year-old Noah Williams in the men’s 10m synchro, an event in which Daley won a dramatic Tokyo gold alongside Matty Lee. Daley and Williams are top-ranked coming into Paris 2024 but the rankings do not fully account for the threat from China, whose pairing of Lian Junjie and Hao Yang have won the past three world titles. The final starts at 10:00. In swimming, GB’s line-up for the men’s 200m freestyle is so strong that Tom Dean, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo, does not make the start list. Instead, Team GB will look to 2023 world champion Matt Richards and Tokyo silver medallist Duncan Scott. Watch out for Romania’s David Popovici, who is a second faster than anyone else this year heading into the event (final starts 19:43). Tom Pidcock is in the middle of an exhausting 2024. He arrives at the Paris Olympics immediately after Covid forced him out of the Tour de France, and then he will compete not just in road cycling but also in mountain biking’s cross-country event, which starts at 13:10. Pidcock’s electric performance to win this event three years ago was a British highlight in Tokyo, and he says defending that title is his priority. In the men’s team gymnastics final (from 16:30), GB have a shot at the podium. China and Japan have looked a class apart in recent years, but the Brits were third at the 2022 world championships and narrowly beaten into fourth by the US a year later. Max Whitlock was in the team that won bronze at London 2012 and has since had to endure back-to-back fourth-place Olympic finishes in this event. Eventing reaches its last day of action, concluding with showjumping from 10:00. Will GB be able to take back-to-back titles? The British are fielding an extraordinarily strong team but jumping is one of those sports where a first tiny error can rapidly become a catastrophe. Anything could happen, no matter how the dressage and cross-country set things up. Brit watch  Adam Burgess was 0.16 seconds away from a medal in canoe slalom’s C1 event at the Tokyo Games. Burgess has embarked on what he calls “project send it” ahead of Paris – learning to “send it a little bit more in the final” to make sure he can truly compete for medals on the Olympic stage. Also sending it from 14:30 will be Benjamin Savsek, the Slovenian who won gold in Tokyo and remains one of the top-ranked in the world. Seonaid McIntosh, from a shooting family, took European silver in the 10m air rifle last year and is inside the top 20 worldwide. The final starts at 08:30. Michael Bargeron competes in the men’s event from 11:00. In hockey, Ireland’s men play Australia at 09:00 before GB’s women play Australia at 16:00. In rugby sevens, GB’s women play South Africa at 13:00. Ireland play Australia at 13:30. World watch  Back at the swimming, the women’s 100m breaststroke (20:32) could become a battle royale. Team USA’s Lilly King is back in the mix after winning gold in 2016, as is Tokyo silver medallist Tatjana Smith, while Lithuania’s Ruta Meilutyte could also feature. China’s Tang Qianting is the world champion and this year’s standout performer. Olha Kharlan is one of Ukraine’s biggest Olympic names, a four-time world champion in women’s sabre and a four-time Olympic fencing medallist. Kharlan qualified for Paris 2024 in unusual circumstances. She did not shake the hand of Russia’s Anna Smirnova at last year's World Championships, Smirnova protested, and Kharlan was disqualified. The International Olympic Committee stepped in to guarantee Kharlan a place at the Games. The women’s sabre final, which Kharlan will hope to reach, takes place from 20:45. Expert knowledge South Korea are again the dominant force in men’s team archery (medal matches from 15:48), but there is just a chance that Turkey disrupt that this year. Led by Tokyo individual champion Mete Gazoz, Turkey ranked a lowly seventh after the qualifying round at last year’s World Championships but picked off the Netherlands and Japan in back-to-back come-from-behind victories to set up a final with South Korea. They lost, but Turkey coach Goktug Ergin has already proclaimed his team ready to fight for medals. It is the country’s first Olympic appearance in this event for 24 years. This video can not be played Paris Olympics 2024: Team GB swimming team-mates take on painting challenge Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's team final), fencing (women's epee team), judo (women's -63kg, men's -81 kg), rugby sevens (women's), shooting (mixed team 10m air pistol, men's trap), surfing (men's and women's), swimming (women's 100m back, men's 800m free, men's 4x200m free relay), table tennis (mixed doubles), triathlon (men's individual). Highlights Top coaches have described the Paris triathlon course as “insane”. It is, at least, in-Seine. You start from the Pont Alexandre III bridge in view of the Eiffel Tower, swim 1,500m in the Seine – two downstream sections and one upstream – then run up a set of posh steps to start the 40km bike course, which introduced some cobbled stretches into the mix. Lastly, there is a 10km run back along the same course. It promises to be a spectacular and challenging event, even by Olympic triathlon standards, and GB’s Alex Yee will hope to be at the front of the action in the men's event. Yee won Olympic silver in a pulsating Tokyo contest three years ago. Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, who pulled past Yee to win gold that day, is back but has since moved up to Ironman distance then back down again, and it remains to be seen if he will master that transition. The race starts at 07:00. Women’s team gymnastics is one of the Olympics’ worldwide blockbuster events. The United States will expect one of its largest TV audiences of the Games for Simone Biles and compatriots, assuming they qualify for Tuesday’s final, which begins at 17:15. Becky Downie, back in the British team for a third Olympics, is tasked with helping to steer GB towards a podium finish. The women’s team event is intensely competitive right now, and any of six or seven nations could take a medal, with the absence of Russian athletes also opening up the contest. There is lots going on in swimming's evening session. Team GB have a real chance of gold in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay, having won the Olympic title in Tokyo and the world title in 2023. Tom Dean, James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott are all veterans of both victories and are in the line-up. The relay starts at 20:59. The women’s 100m backstroke at 19:57 is expected to feature Australia’s Kaylee McKeown, a three-time champion in Tokyo, against the likes of American Regan Smith and Canada’s Kylie Masse. Brit watch It is day one of dressage. Yes, you did just see dressage a few days ago. That was eventing dressage. This is dressage dressage, where GB have an extremely accomplished team. The event begins at 10:00. Freestyle BMX begins with qualifiers featuring GB’s Kieran Reilly and Charlotte Worthington (12:25 onward). Reilly is the men’s world champion and Worthington is the Olympic champion. In the men’s event, France’s Anthony Jeanjean is an imposing threat to Reilly, particularly having demonstrated he can entertain a home crowd with a World Cup win in Montpellier leading up the Games. Australia’s Logan Martin is defending his Tokyo title. Joe Clarke, who won canoe slalom gold in Rio eight years ago but was left out of the GB team for Tokyo in 2021, is back for Paris and begins his K1 event with the heats from 15:00. Mallory Franklin, the women’s C1 Tokyo silver medallist and world champion, starts her heats at 14:00. GB men's hockey team play the Netherlands, the only team with a better world ranking, in their group at 11:45. Ireland play India at 12:15. Tokyo bronze medallist Matthew Coward-Holley and 2022 world silver medallist Nathan Hales will hope to be in the men’s trap shooting final from 14:30. Coward-Holley comes into the Games ranked third in the world behind Spain’s Alberto Fernandez and Australia’s James Willett. World watch A win on home turf would give France’s Tokyo opening ceremony flagbearer, Clarisse Agbegnenou, a third Olympic judo gold alongside the -63kg and mixed team titles she won three years ago. Lucy Renshall is GB’s representative in the event. Medal contests from 16:49. 3x3 basketball is making its second Olympic appearance after a debut in Tokyo, offering a street version of the game using half a court. Latvia won the first 3x3 Olympic men’s title three years ago and begin their defence against Lithuania (17:35), who proved a surprise package at the 2022 World Championships, getting all the way to the final with victories against teams including France and the US. Surfing presents a dilemma for writers of day-by-day guides: if it starts on Tuesday and goes through the night into Wednesday, where to put it? In case you want to follow the whole thing: the quarter-finals begin at 18:00 on Tuesday, the semi-finals will go past midnight, the men’s gold-medal contest will be at 02:34 on Wednesday and the women’s final will be at 03:15. Remember, this is because the surfing is in Tahiti, which is 12 hours behind France. The US will expect to win the women’s surfing title with the likes of Olympic champion Carissa Moore and world champion Caroline Marks on the team, but watch out for Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb, Costa Rica’s Brisa Hennessy and France’s Vahine Fierro, who used to live in Tahiti and trains there. On the men’s side, Brazil’s Gabriel Medina and US surfer John John Florence are two out of a dozen or more names in with a serious chance of winning. Tahitian Kauli Vaast, surfing for France, is an underdog who could exploit his local knowledge. Women’s rugby sevens reaches the final at 18:45. Will GB improve on fourth place in Tokyo? Can France go one better than last time and clinch gold on home soil? Will New Zealand be all-conquering again, or can Australia get back to their winning ways of 2016? Expert knowledge The Dominican Republic's men's football team, whose squad includes Leeds defender Junior Firpo, are playing fellow Olympic debutants Uzbekistan (14:00). This might be both teams' best shot at a result if tough encounters against Egypt and Spain do not go their way. Something jaw-dropping happened at Tokyo 2020: China failed to win one of the table tennis gold medals. To put this in perspective, China have won 32 of the 37 Olympic table tennis titles ever contested, and the one they missed in Tokyo was the first the country had not won since 2004. To rub salt into that wound, it was a new event, the mixed doubles, where Japan’s Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito pulled off a come-from-behind win over Chinese rivals for gold on home soil. Could China possibly be denied again? Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha are the world number one-ranked duo coming into the Paris 2024 mixed doubles, which concludes with the final at 13:30. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (men's individual all-around), BMX freestyle (men's and women's), canoe slalom (women's C1), diving (women's synchro 10m platform), fencing (men's sabre team), judo (women's-70kg, men's -90kg), rowing (men's quadruple sculls, women's quadruple sculls), shooting (women's trap), swimming (women's 100m free, men's 200m fly, women's 1500m free, men's 200m breast, men's 100m free), triathlon (women's individual). Highlights Wednesday is the women’s turn to take on the Paris triathlon course from 07:00. Team GB have a very strong team in world champion Beth Potter, Tokyo individual silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown and world top 10-ranked Kate Waugh. France’s Cassandre Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi are also contenders for gold at their home Games. The men's all-around gymnastics final begins at 16:30, an event where athletes compete on all six apparatus to decide the best overall gymnast at the Olympics. Max Whitlock made it on to the Rio podium in this event eight years ago, but defending champion and multiple world title-winner Daiki Hashimoto is the favourite. We reach the freestyle BMX finals from 12:10, where GB’s Charlotte Worthington and Kieran Reilly are proven champions on the world stage. This is freestyle’s second Olympic appearance. To win gold, perform as many tricks as you can in 60 seconds and make sure they are better than anyone else’s. Depending on how Tuesday’s heats went, Wednesday could bring a medal opportunity for GB’s Mallory Franklin in the C1 women’s canoe slalom (final from 16:25). Australia’s Jessica Fox, one of the greatest canoeists of all time and the Tokyo champion, will be one of Franklin’s biggest rivals. Watch out for Elena Lilik, who beat Andrea Herzog – Tokyo’s bronze medallist – to claim Germany’s sole entry in this event. Brit watch Rowing’s quadruple sculls finals begin at 11:26. Britain are the world champions in the women’s event and picked up 2022 world silver in the men’s race. In shooting, Lucy Hall, a European silver medallist in 2022, will hope to feature in the women’s trap final at 14:30. Jemima Yeats-Brown lost her sister and biggest fan, Jenny, to brain cancer just after winning Commonwealth judo bronze in 2022. Yeats-Brown says that has helped inspire a “life’s too short” approach to competing that helped her secure fifth at the World Championships in 2023. She fights in the -70kg category, where medal contests start at 16:18. In hockey, GB’s women play South Africa at 09:30. World watch The 100m freestyle contest at the pool (21:15) is a chance to see Caeleb Dressel, regarded as one of the greatest sprinters in US and world swimming, defending his Tokyo title. There is a lot of hype coming into Paris about David Popovici, a superstar of the Romanian team, but he had a tough 2023. This is a chance for Popovici to make an impact after finishing seventh in Tokyo aged just 16, while Matt Richards and Duncan Scott swim for GB. Also watch for Anna Hopkin in the women’s 100m freestyle (19:30), James Wilby in the men’s 200m breaststroke (21:08) and American Katie Ledecky in the women’s 1,500m free (20:04). In men’s basketball the US-South Sudan game (20:00) pits one of the most dominant teams in Olympic history against a first-time entrant. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011 and its basketball federation joined world governing body Fiba in 2013, so getting to the Olympics about a decade later is pretty good going, to put it mildly. At the heart of that story? Luol Deng, who played basketball for GB at London 2012. Deng, who spent a decade playing for the NBA’s Chicago Bulls, holds British and South Sudanese citizenship. For years as a coach, he has been a driving force (and financial force) behind the South Sudan team’s rise to Olympic status. Facing the US in Paris may be the pinnacle of that incredible story arc. Expert knowledge  Lois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix come into Paris 2024 as history-makers before they even start their first dive. The duo won world silver last year, the first time Britain had won any women’s diving medal at that level. If they win another medal here – the women’s 10m synchro diving final starts at 10:00 – watch for some cartwheels on the BBC studio sofa, as Andrea’s dad is Fred Sirieix, star of First Dates turned BBC presenter at Paris 2024. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's individual all-around), athletics (men's and women's 20km race walk), canoe slalom (men K1), fencing (women's foil team), judo (women's -78kg, men's -100kg), rowing (women's double sculls, men's double sculls, women's coxless four, men's coxless four), sailing (men's and women's skiff), shooting (men's 50m rifle 3 positions) and swimming (women's 200m fly, men's 200m back, women's 200m breast, women's 4x200m free relay). Highlights British rowers are used to heaps of gold medals – more than 30 of them in Olympic rowing. GB were the top rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Then came Tokyo and not one gold. They were 14th in the rowing medal table, which was a shock. Thursday might be the day we know if the Brits are turning that ship around. Helen Glover will hope to lead an impressive women’s four in the final at 10:50, while the men’s four won the world title in both 2022 and 2023. Their final is at 11:10. The space of about half an hour could play a huge role in deciding if this Olympic regatta is a GB return to form. The rowers are not the only ones who had a Tokyo to forget. Joe Clarke did not make the team despite being the defending Olympic champion in K1 slalom canoeing. Now, he is back and will hope to be a big factor in the Paris final from 16:30. The women’s all-around gymnastics final at 17:15 could see some remarkable history being made. If they are both healthy and nominated for this event, American duo Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee could make this the first women’s all-around final in which the past two Olympic champions have competed. Biles won in 2016, followed by Lee in 2020. If either of them wins gold, they will be the first woman to win multiple Olympic all-around titles since Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968. Brit watch Golf found its way back on to the Olympic schedule in 2016 after more than a century in the wilderness (or perhaps deep rough). At Paris 2024, the course is L’Albatros at Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2018. The first round of the men’s event starts at 08:00 and features GB’s Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood, Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and a host of the sport’s other big names. Luke Greenbank will hope to better his Tokyo bronze medal in the men’s 200m backstroke (19:37) at the pool. Meanwhile, Team GB have been top-four material of late in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay so could pose a medal threat there too (20:48). Beth Shriever has remained dominant in BMX racing since winning Olympic gold in Tokyo. However, she fractured her collarbone at the sport’s World Championships in May, meaning one of GB’s big medal hopes has faced a race against time. From 19:20 we will see how that comeback has progressed as the early stages of her event take place. In the men’s event, Olympic and world silver medallist Kye Whyte is returning from a back injury of his own. In hockey, GB’s men take on hosts France at 11:45, Ireland’s men play Argentina at 12:15 and GB’s women face the US at 16:00. Showjumping begins with the team qualifier from 10:00. Scott Brash and Ben Maher, who were part of Britain’s gold medal-winning team at London 2012, are joined this time around by Harry Charles. World watch Back at the pool, Katie Ledecky may have a shot at some Olympic history by this point in the Games. If she has won two medals by this point – very possible, given the 200m free and 400m free will have been and gone, and she has won golds in both in the past – then a medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay (20:48) would be her 13th overall, a record for a US female Olympian. (Three American women, all of them swimmers, have previously reached 12: Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin.) The men’s and women’s 20km race walks begin at 06:30 and 08:20 respectively. Chinese veteran Liu Hong, the 2016 women’s champion, is trying to end a run of five years – ages, by her standards – without a major title. Spain’s Maria Perez is the world champion, having been on the brink of quitting the sport in 2022 after back-to-back disqualifications at that year’s European and world championships. Another Spanish athlete, Alvaro Martin, is the men’s world champion. At Roland Garros, we reach the first tennis semi-finals from 11:00. Expert knowledge The first sailing medals of the Games will be awarded in the skiff class. For the men, this means the 49er, and for the women it is the 49er FX (a version designed to work with a lighter two-person crew than the 49er). Saskia Tidey is at her third Olympics and representing her second country in sailing.  Tidey sailed for Ireland in 2016, then switched to GB for Tokyo once it became apparent that she had no suitable Irish partner available in the two-person event. Tidey and GB team-mate Charlotte Dobson finished sixth three years ago, and now Tidey is back with new partner Freya Black. The two were European bronze medallists in May. GB’s James Peters and Fynn Sterritt, in the men’s event, said before the Games they had been trying to put on weight after realising they were one of the lighter boats in the men’s fleet. Britain are the defending champions in this event after Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell won gold three years ago.  Gold medal events: Archery (mixed team), athletics (men's 10,000m), badminton (mixed doubles), BMX racing (men's and women's), diving (men's synchro 3m springboard), equestrian (jumping team), fencing (men's epee team), judo (women's +78kg, men's +100kg), rowing (men's coxless pair, women's coxless pair, men's lightweight double sculls, women's lightweight double sculls), sailing (men's and women's windsurfing), shooting (women's 50m rifle 3 positions), swimming (men's 50m free, women's 200m back, men's 200m individual medley), tennis (mixed doubles), trampoline gymnastics (women's and men's). Highlights Keely Hodgkinson, tipped to be one of Team GB’s biggest stars in Paris, appears for the first time in the 800m heats from 18:45. The 22-year-old is hoping to upgrade Tokyo silver to gold in 2024. Earlier, Dina Asher-Smith will be in the opening stages of the women’s 100m from 10:50. She, like Hodgkinson, won the European title in her event last month. Jack Laugher will dive with his third different partner in as many Olympics when he competes in the men’s 3m synchro diving from 10:00. Anthony Harding is Laugher’s team-mate this time. They have won two world silver medals together, each time behind China. Laugher won this event with Chris Mears at Rio 2016. It is BMX racing finals day. If Beth Shriever and Kye Whyte have recovered from pre-Games injuries and are still in the running, they will have to negotiate the semi-finals before the gold-medal races from 20:35. Both riders are in the world’s top six. France have a trio of highly rated riders on the men’s side, while Australia’s Saya Sakakibara is seeking redemption in the women’s event after a semi-final crash in Tokyo. Bryony Page stunned the field when she took the first Olympic trampoline medal in Britain’s history, silver in 2016. She added bronze in Tokyo and has won two of the past three world titles, setting up one another bid for gold aged 33 before she pursues her dream of joining the acrobats at Cirque du Soleil. Qualifying is at 11:00 before the final at 12:50. Lightweight scullers Emily Craig and Imogen Grant missed a medal in the women’s lightweight double sculls by 0.01 seconds in Tokyo. Since then, they have won back-to-back world titles and are considered one of the British rowing team’s best hopes for gold in Paris. The final takes place at 11:22. In sailing, windsurfing reaches its final day. This year’s windsurfing event involves a new class, iQFoil, which replaces the old RS:X class. The way the IOC explains the difference is that “instead of floating, the board appears to fly” in the iQFoil class because of hydrofoils that lift the board out of the water at certain speeds. Emma Wilson, who won RS:X bronze in Tokyo, has world silver and bronze medals in iQFoil and will hope to be going for a podium place on Friday. Brit watch Swimming on Friday features GB’s Ben Proud versus American Caeleb Dressel in the men’s 50m freestyle (final at 19:30). Dressel is the Tokyo Olympic champion, while Proud has a gold and two bronzes from the past three World Championships. Australia’s Cameron McEvoy will also be hoping for a medal. In shooting, world number one Seonaid McIntosh takes aim in the women’s 50m rifle three positions from 08:30. The “three positions” part means you shoot kneeling, prone (lying down) and standing. Friday’s equestrian highlight is the team jumping final at 13:00, featuring a British team who took world bronze behind Sweden and the Netherlands in 2022. In hockey, Ireland’s men play New Zealand at 16:00, followed by GB against Germany at 19:15. World watch Returning to the pool, the men’s 200m individual medley (19:49) offers an opportunity for French swimming star Leon Marchand to try to surpass Ryan Lochte’s world record time. Lochte’s record is one minute 54.00 seconds, while Marchand got down to 1:54.82 in winning world gold ahead of GB’s Duncan Scott and Tom Dean last year. Tokyo silver medallist Scott and Dean will hope to make the Paris final, while Tokyo champion Wang Shun of China is back. In the men's 50m freestyle, France will be cheering for Florent Manaudou, London 2012 gold medallist in the event and one of the hosts’ two flagbearers at the opening ceremony. Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei has dominated the men’s 10,000m but was beaten by Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega in an extraordinarily humid Tokyo 2020 final. Both are back for 2024 and this is the only title on offer during the opening night of athletics (20:20). Badminton’s mixed doubles final (15:10) is highly likely to have at least one Chinese entry and it would be no surprise if, like Tokyo, the final was between two Chinese teams. Three years ago, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong were defeated by Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping. Gold medallist Wang has since retired, so silver medallists Zheng and Huang Yaqiong may end up facing Huang Dongping and new partner Feng Yanzhe this time around. Archery’s mixed team final takes place from 15:43. In Tokyo, an arrow from South Korea’s An San hit and split an arrow shot by team-mate Kim Je-deok on their way to gold in this event. This is almost impossible to achieve and is known as a “Robin Hood arrow”. According to World Archery, this may have been the first time a Robin Hood arrow was ever filmed in competition. The two arrows are now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Tennis reaches the mixed doubles final and men’s singles semi-finals (11:00-20:00). The men’s football quarter-finals take place in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux with kick-offs between 14:00 and 20:00. In women’s 3x3 basketball, two of the world’s top-ranked nations – France and the US – meet at 12:00. Expert knowledge Teddy Riner will try to equal the Olympic judo record for three individual gold medals in front of his home crowd. The 100+kg event’s medal rounds begin at 16:49. Riner is virtually unbeatable. Between September 2010 and February 2020, he won 154 consecutive contests. At the Tokyo Olympics, he had to settle for bronze after losing to Russia’s Tamerlan Bashaev, his first defeat at the Games since 2008. He has not lost at Grand Slam or World Championship level since Tokyo. Gold medal events: Archery (women's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's floor, women's vault, men's pommel horse finals), athletics (men's shot put, women's triple jump, mixed 4x400m relay, women's 100m, men's decathlon), badminton (women's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix special team), fencing (women's sabre team), judo (mixed team), road cycling (men's road race), rowing (women's single sculls, men's single sculls, women's eight, men's eight), shooting (women's 25m pistol, men's skeet), swimming (men's 100m fly, women's 200m individual medley, women's 800m free, mixed 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (women's singles), tennis (women's singles, men's doubles). Highlights Britain’s fastest female sprinter, Dina Asher-Smith, will hope to line up in the 100m final at 20:20. Asher-Smith has changed coach and moved to train in Texas since a disappointing eighth place in last year’s world final. “I want to win the Olympics and I want to run really fast,” she has said. Big rivals include US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson and Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson. Richardson has the year’s leading mark of 10.71 seconds. At 16:10, the pommel horse final is Max Whitlock’s chance to deliver on his aim of an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus. Ireland’s world champion and pommel horse specialist Rhys McClenaghan will have his sights on gold. The women’s vault final (15:20) may feature Simone Biles, the Rio 2016 champion, returning to an event from which she withdrew in Tokyo. This is the last day of rowing and the very last final on the list is the men’s eight (10:10). Britain won this event in 2016 but New Zealand were the winners in Tokyo. GB have recovered to win the past two world titles. Defending champions Canada, Romania and the US are contenders in the women’s eight (09:50). Dressage’s team event concludes from 09:00. GB have not been off the Olympic podium since a memorable victory at London 2012, but can they get back to the top step? Brit watch It is the penultimate night at the pool. GB smashed the world record to win the mixed 4x100m medley relay (20:33) when it was held for the first time at the Tokyo Games. This is a great relay to watch as there is a heap of strategy involved in looking at your team’s strengths and weaknesses, then deciding who you put on which leg. It is often not clear which team’s plan is paying off until the final moments. Cycling returns with the men’s road race (10:00). GB have qualified a full four-man team that features Tom Pidcock, who only just competed in Olympic mountain-biking last week, never mind half of the Tour de France before dropping out with Covid. The course reaches a climax with three laps of cobbled climb before a downhill stretch and a sprint towards the Trocadero. Kayak cross is new at the Olympics. If you have seen snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics then – yes, that, except in whitewater. Instead of the usual Olympic slalom canoeing against the clock, paddlers race each other to the finish. They have to turn around in whitewater, flip their boats and perform all sorts of other manoeuvres along the way. The opening rounds begin at 14:30 and Team GB have some of the world’s best athletes. Saturday’s hockey includes GB’s women versus Argentina at 09:00. World watch Serena Williams, Monica Puig and Belinda Bencic are your last three women’s singles tennis champions at the Olympics. Who will it be this time? World number one Iga Swiatek has Olympic success in her blood – her dad, Tomasz Swiatek, was a rower for Poland at Seoul 1988. The hosts will pin their hopes on Caroline Garcia making it this far. This is also the day of the men’s doubles final, an event that includes Andy Murray and Dan Evans plus Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski for GB. Elsewhere in the night’s swimming action, Katie Ledecky has a shot at a fourth consecutive gold in the women’s 800m freestyle (20:09). It could be close, though. Last time, in Tokyo, Ariarne Titmus was just a second behind her – the first time anyone had been within four seconds of Ledecky in an Olympic final over this distance. On the track, the men’s 100m first round (from 10:45) allows us a first look at world champion Noah Lyles and Christian Coleman, both representing the US, as well as GB trio Zharnel Hughes, Louie Hinchliffe and Jeremiah Azu. Keep an eye out for “Africa’s fastest man” Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya and Jamaican title challenger Kishane Thompson. The decathlon concludes with the 1500m race at 20:45. France’s Kevin Mayer, a silver medallist in Tokyo and Rio, will be trying to upgrade that on home soil, although team-mate Makenson Gletty comes in with a better world ranking. Canada, boasting Olympic champion Damian Warner and world champion Pierce LePage, will be tough to beat. Badminton’s women’s doubles is a big target for Indonesia. Apriyani Rahayu won Tokyo gold with Greysia Polii and is now paired with Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti after Polii’s retirement. China’s Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan are the favourites. The two teams meet each other in the group stages, which may help set the scene for Saturday’s final (15:10). Women football reaches the quarter-final stage with games kicking off at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 20:00. Expert knowledge  Ledecky is not the only athlete capable of racking up a fourth gold medal in an event on Saturday. Skeet shooter Vincent Hancock won gold in Beijing, London and Tokyo for the US, a remarkable record marred only by finishing 15th in Rio. This time around, Hancock is coming in ranked 17th in the world. As of the start of Saturday, only six people have won the same individual event four times at the Olympics: Denmark’s Paul Elvstrom in sailing, Americans Al Oerter and Carl Lewis in athletics, Japan’s Kaori Icho and Cuba’s Mijain Lopez in wrestling, and Michael Phelps for the US in swimming. Nobody has ever won the same individual event five times at the Olympics (although it could happen in Paris – see Tuesday, 6 August). Ledecky at LA 2028, anyone? Olympic Games fan zones to be set up across the UK Olympics 2024: how extreme weather could impact Paris games Gold medal events: Archery (men's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's rings, women's uneven bars, men's vault), athletics (women's high jump, men's hammer throw, men's 100m), badminton (men's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix freestyle individual), fencing (men's foil team), golf (men's round 4), road cycling (women's road race), shooting (women's skeet), swimming (women's 50m free, men's 1500m free, men's 4x100m medley relay, women's 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (men's singles), tennis (women's doubles and men's singles). Highlights Sunday at 20:55 is go time for the men’s 100m final. Will Zharnel Hughes be on the start line for GB after a world bronze last year? Will Noah Lyles become the first American to win this event since 2004? Can Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo pull off an upgrade on last year’s world silver? Roland Garros hosts the Olympic men’s singles final. Many fans would love a Nadal-Djokovic Olympic final on clay here. They have met once before at the Games, in the Beijing 2008 semi-finals, which Nadal won. Realistically, the Spaniard may have a better chance of a medal in the doubles. Serbia's Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to win the one big title still missing from his collection. The final round of the men’s golf competition begins at 08:00. American Xander Schauffele will be in Paris to defend his title, and he has said an Olympic gold medal is proving increasingly valuable in a sport that, until Rio 2016, was all about its four majors. Spain’s Jon Rahm will be one of the highest-profile LIV Golf players at the Games. Lizzie Deignan is the first female British cyclist to be selected for four Olympic Games. Deignan – the London 2012 silver medallist and 2015 world champion – is joined by national champion Pfeiffer Georgi, Anna Henderson and Anna Morris for Sunday’s women’s road race, which starts at 13:00. A strong Dutch team for this race features Ellen van Dijk, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes and Marianne Vos, who won gold in London 12 years ago. Brit watch With Charlotte Dujardin pulling out on Tuesday, team-mate Lottie Fry - daughter of Laura, who rode at Barcelona 1992 – could be one of the biggest challengers in this event. In gymnastics, Jake Jarman won world vault gold last year and backed it up with a European title in April. The 22-year-old has the chance to turn that form into an Olympic title at 15:25. Becky Downie could be a contender in the uneven bars from 14:40. Amber Rutter welcomed her first child to the world in April. Now she’s shooting for skeet gold at Paris 2024 (qualification from 08:30, final from 14:30). Rutter missed Tokyo 2020 through a positive Covid test just before she travelled, which she says was devastating at the time but ultimately helped reshape her life goals to include both personal priorities and Olympic aims. In track and field action, world silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith is in the opening round of the men’s 400m from 18:05. Men’s hockey reaches the quarter-final stages. World watch The first round of the men’s 110m hurdles begins at 10:50. Grant Holloway was the Tokyo favourite until he “lost composure” in his words and allowed Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment to thunder past. Holloway has since won both available world titles and is on the US team for Paris. In the women’s 400m hurdles first round (11:35) watch for another American, defending champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, testing herself against Dutch world champion Femke Bol. The last night of swimming at Paris 2024 (from 17:30) features four finals: the women’s 50m free, men’s 1,500m free, men’s 4x100m medley and women’s 4x100m medley. Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom is a big contender in the women’s 50m free, while the women’s 4x100m medley could turn into a classic US-Australia battle. GB won men’s medley silver in Tokyo. The table tennis men’s singles final could be an opportunity for China’s Ma Long to extend an extraordinary Olympic streak (13:30). Ma comes into the Games having won all five Olympic titles available to him since 2012 – three team, two individual. Expert knowledge We are well into the quarter-finals and semi-finals of boxing’s various weights. In the women’s middleweight division (75kg), where quarter-finals take place on Sunday, UK-based Cindy Ngamba is fighting for the Olympic Refugee Team. Ngamba is unable to return to Cameroon, where she was born, because of her sexuality – homosexuality in the country is punishable with up to five years in prison. She is the first boxer ever selected for an Olympic refugee team. Fencing at Paris 2024 concludes with men’s team foil (19:30), a perfect finale for the hosts, who are the defending champions. To score a point, you need to strike your opponent on their torso, shoulder or neck with the tip of your weapon. You also need to have “right of way” which, if you’re new to fencing, is a concept best left to the referee, who decides which fencer has attacking priority at any given time. In the team event, everyone cycles through a series of mini head-to-head match-ups until one team scores 45. Alternatively, the highest-scoring team wins if the ninth and final bout ends without either team reaching 45.

694,Morocco beat Argentina in game marred by crowd trouble,"This video can not be played Watch the story of Argentina's game against Morocco that lasted four hours Crowd trouble forced the first football match of the Olympics to be suspended for nearly two hours amid chaotic and worrying scenes, with the game eventually completed in an empty stadium. Morocco had been 2-0 ahead against Argentina, who pulled a goal back and were pushing for an equaliser. Cristian Medina then appeared to have made it 2-2 in the 16th of what had been 15 scheduled minutes of injury time at the end of the second half. After the resulting crowd trouble, play finally resumed after a lengthy delay with no fans present, and with VAR having ruled out Argentina's equaliser, Morocco secured a controversial 2-1 victory. A number of bottles and cups were thrown at the celebrating players after Argentina's second goal, which was later disallowed Fans had to leave the stadium after the crowd trouble Here's how the chaos and confusion unfolded...  Immediately after Medina looked to have made it 2-2, a number of cups and bottles were then thrown at the celebrating Argentina side before what appeared to be a flare landed near the players and coaching staff. A number of fans in Morocco colours also ran on to the pitch, with some being escorted off the pitch by stewards. Riot police moved to the side of the pitch and the referee immediately took the players off the pitch. The fans inside the stadium in Saint Etienne were told to leave the ground and a message on a big screen said: ""Your session has been suspended please make your way to the nearest exit."" It was unclear whether the match had been classed as finished, but it was then revealed the final three minutes would be played in an empty stadium with no fans present. Before the match could be played to a finish, it was announced that Argentina's potential equaliser had actually been ruled out by a video assistant referee decision that showed a player was offside before Medina scored. 'Circus' football opener 'pathetic' - Mascherano This video can not be played Late goal sends Argentina v Morocco game into chaos Referee Glenn Nyberg gestures after VAR disallowed Argentina's second goal The players had gone off the pitch at 16:05 BST, and they then came back to warm up at 17:45 before the match could resume at 18:00. Immediately the referee checked to see if the 'equaliser' should stand via a pitchside monitor and, as expected, the 'goal' was disallowed. Play resumed just after 18:00 for the last three minutes, and with neither side scoring further, Morocco won the match 2-1. Both Morocco goals were scored by Soufiane Rahimi, one just before half-time and then a penalty early in the second half as they looked to begin their 2024 gold-medal bid with a win. Argentina pulled a goal back through Giuliano Simeone, the son of Atletico Madrid manager and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone. But, after all the drama, it was Morocco who took the three points. Argentina won the men's Olympic football tournament in 2004 and 2008 and ex-Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano, who was a part of the winning squad for the second of those successes, is managing the team in 2024. Mascherano's side will now need to get positive results against Iraq on Saturday and Ukraine on Tuesday to have a chance of finishing in the top two in the group and advancing to the quarter-finals. A statement from the tournament organisers said: ""The football match between Argentina and Morocco at the Saint-Etienne Stadium was suspended due to a pitch invasion by a small number of spectators.  ""The match then restarted and was able to conclude safely. Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions.""

695,What to expect from an Olympic ceremony like no other,"The opening ceremony will signal the official start of the 2024 Paris Olympics  The opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics promises to be an event like no other. In a first for the Games, the spectacle will not be in a stadium, instead taking place on Paris' famous River Seine. Here is all you need to know about the ceremony... When do the Olympics start? How City of Light changed the Olympics The eye-catching ceremony will take place across a 6km route along the Seine. It will begin at Austerlitz bridge and end among the gardens, fountains and palaces in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at Trocadero.   There will be almost 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes, plus a host of dignitaries, which sail past Paris' iconic landmarks, including Notre Dame cathedral and Pont Neuf. The boats will transport the athletes in the parade but also be used in the artistic part of the ceremony, which will showcase the history and culture of Paris and France. The identity of the performers, though, has been kept a tight secret.  Thousands of people are still expected to line the river and the streets with millions more watching on television around the world. ""I’d like to show France in all its diversity,"" said Thomas Jolly, the French actor and theatre director named as the ceremony's artistic director - the role performed by Danny Boyle at London 2012. ""Illustrate the richness and plurality shaped by its history, which has been influenced and inspired by the diverse cultures that have passed through it, while itself serving as a source of inspiration."" The ceremony will also include the official opening of the Games, carried out by France president Emmanuel Macron, and the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. Again, many of the finer details have been kept as a surprise. Seating for spectators has been set up along the Seine for the ceremony The ceremony begins at 19:30 local time (18:30 BST) on Friday, 26 July. It is expected to last just under four hours, with the final stages taking place as the sun sets across the French capital.  Thankfully, the Paris weather forecast for Friday evening is good. Keeping with tradition, Greece will be the first nation introduced during the ceremony.  NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of their flagbearers for the Games. Greece will then be followed by the Refugee Olympic Team, while hosts France will be the last to be introduced.  Those athletes from Russia and Belarus competing as individuals because of their countries' role in the war in Ukraine will not take part. The opening ceremony will be shown live from 17:45 BST on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will be radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds from 19:00 BST. There will also be live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app bringing you the best of the event from Paris.",2024-07-24 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c728e504xego,Unknown,2024-07-24 23:10:54,,True
697,Canada send two staff members home over drone incident,"British coach Beverly Priestman is manager of Canada's women's team, who won gold in Tokyo in 2021 Canada women's football manager Beverly Priestman will not take charge of her side's Olympics opener against New Zealand after two members of her backroom staff were sent home for allegedly flying a drone over the Kiwis' team training session.  Priestman, 38, has ""voluntarily withdrawn"" from Thursday's match in St Etienne after the New Zealand Olympic Committee reported that a drone had been flown over their training session on Monday.  Jasmine Mander, Priestman's assistant, has been sent home along with ""unaccredited analyst"" Joseph Lombardi. Fifa said it has opened disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi and Mander. The Canadian Olympic Committee say a scouting report filed by Lombardi was sent to Mander.  Priestman says she takes responsibility for the actions of her colleagues.  ""I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,” Priestman said.  “I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.""  The COC confirmed on Wednesday that a ""non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team"" was detained by authorities.  ""The Canadian Olympic Committee stands for fair play and we are shocked and disappointed,"" it added in a statement., external ""We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee.""

699,Graphic footage shows US officers standing over body of Trump gunman,"Bodycam footage captured shortly after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump shows Secret Service and local law enforcement officers near the lifeless body of the gunman. A trail of blood can be seen near the body of the deceased gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was able to fire at the former president from a roof overlooking the outdoor rally in Pennsylvania 10 days ago. One audience member, Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed and two others - David Dutch, 57 and James Copenhaver, 57 - were badly wounded but are in a stable condition. The new footage emerged hours after US Secret Service director Kim Cheatle resigned over security failures surrounding the assassination attempt. The bodycam video captured by Butler County Emergency Services Unit was posted on X by the office of Republican Senator Chuck Grassley. ""A Beaver County sniper seen and sent the pictures out, this is him,"" one Secret Service agent can be heard saying in the video, referring to the shooter's body. ""I don't know if you got the same ones I did?"" an officer asks the agent of the photos. ""I think I did, yeah, he's [the shooter] got his glasses on,"" the agent replies. The officer adds the sniper ""sent the original pictures, and seen him (the shooter) come from the bike, and set the book bag down, and then lost sight of him"".  The agent also asks about whether an abandoned bike that was found in the area belonged to the shooter. ""We don't know,"" an officer replies. Discussions can also be heard about ""victims in the crowd"" and ""people detained who were filming"". Senator Grassley is one of many members of Congress demanding a full investigation into the incident. Lawmakers questioned Ms Cheatle about security preparations ahead of the campaign rally during a six-hour House of Representatives Oversight Committee hearing on Monday. Ms Cheatle said she took responsibility for the security lapses, but during the hearing she pushed back on calls to resign. She called the shooting ""the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades"". Witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man - suspect Crooks - with a rifle on a rooftop at the rally minutes before shots were fired. Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper shortly after getting a volley of shots off. Trump was injured in the right ear. He later said he felt the bullet ""ripping through the skin"". Blood was visible on Trump's face as protection officers rushed him away. On Tuesday night, Ms Cheatle resigned in a letter sent to staff saying as director she took ""full responsibility for the security lapses"".

704,Kamala Harris is counting on her sorority sisters,"There are many glass ceilings a Kamala Harris presidency could shatter. One of them is that she could be the first black sorority member to sit in the Oval Office. The US vice-president, who spoke on Wednesday at the biennial convention of Zeta Phi Beta, is a life-time member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. The two organisations are among the predominantly black sororities and fraternities that make up the National Pan-Hellenic Council. Commonly called the Divine Nine, its nearly four million members are poised to become a secret weapon as Ms Harris seeks the presidency. Less than 24 hours after Joe Biden endorsed his deputy to seek the Democratic nomination in his place, the group vowed to launch an ""unprecedented voter registration, education and mobilisation"" drive. As a non-profit, the National Pan-Hellenic Council is non-partisan and cannot officially endorse Ms Harris. But it is promising a campaign that ""will activate the thousands of chapters and members in our respective organisations to ensure strong voter turnout in the communities we serve"". That is in line with how the Divine Nine historically gets behind its own. Its members have supported Ms Harris, 59, in the past as she climbed the ladder of national politics. Greek life on US university campuses typically evokes images of young white men or women living together in group houses and drinking booze out of red solo cups. But black Greek-letter clubs emerged at the turn of the 20th century as support systems that offered kinship to black students experiencing segregation and social isolation at majority-white institutions.  The first black fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, began as a study group at Cornell in 1906, according to The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities by Lawrence C Ross. Its membership has included civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Olympic gold medallist Jesse Owens. Ms Harris pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation's oldest black sorority, as a senior - or fourth-year student - at Howard University in Washington DC. She has previously said the experience ""changed my life"". Both in its individual parts and as a collective, the Divine Nine is built around shared values of scholarship, civic engagement and community service. It has lobbied in the past for everything from federal anti-lynching legislation and women's suffrage to high school tutoring and financial aid opportunities for black youth, according to Mr Ross's book. Membership is for life, he writes, which is ""almost spiritual"" and ""makes you realize that your life on earth has more meaning than just your own selfish needs"". Of her AKA connection, Ms Harris said in 2019: ""Throughout your life, you find friends who become family and – like family – they help shape you and your life experiences. For me, that was the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. who became my sisters."" That year, as the then-California senator launched a campaign for president, her fellow ""sorors"" canvassed and phone-banked to get out the vote. When she became Mr Biden's running mate, images of AKAs and other Divine Niners, accessorised with heels and pearls, went viral for their Stroll to the Polls in Atlanta, in the battleground state of Georgia. The Biden-Harris ticket went on to narrowly win the state, powered in part by strong black turnout. Though Ms Harris's candidacy for the November 2024 election is only a few days old, the backing of her sisters is already providing consequential. On a Sunday night Zoom call, the group Win With Black Women - which includes several Divine Nine members - helped raise more than $1m (£775,000) in roughly three hours for the nascent campaign. ""People are just energised,"" Crystal Sewell, an AKA leader, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. ""And really really excited about possibilities [as] it relates to VP Harris and her candidacy."" Ms Harris, who is seeking to make history as America's first female president, is leaning into that enthusiasm. Speaking to 6,000 fired up Zeta Phi Beta women at a convention centre in Indianapolis on Wednesday, she promised them ""we are not playing around"" if she defeats Donald Trump this November. Her keynote address was scheduled weeks ago, but - touching on topics such as abortion, gun control and Project 2025 - the vice-president laid out the stakes of her candidacy. ""We face a choice between two different visions for our nation,"" she told the crowd. ""One focused on the future, the other focused on the past. With your support, I am fighting for our nation's future."" ""So let us continue to fight,"" she added, ""because when we fight, we win.""",2024-07-24 23:10:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05p714907o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
703,Nicolás Maduro: The leader who promised to win 'by hook or by crook',"When President Nicolás Maduro took to the stage on 4 February this year to mark the anniversary of a failed coup lead by his mentor, Hugo Chávez, his rhetoric was always going to be fiery. The fourth of February is the day when followers of Chavismo, the political movement created by the late Chávez, celebrate its foundation in 1992.  Speaking to a loyal crowd of Chavistas dressed in their traditional red T-shirts, he urged them to show ""nerves of steel"" ahead of this July's presidential election. He had good reason to do so. Last October, 2.4 million Venezuelans cast their vote in a primary organised by a coalition of opposition parties.  It was won by María Corina Machado with 93% of the vote. Ms Machado has since become Mr Maduro's most formidable opponent, managing what had eluded others before her - to unite the notoriously divided Venezuelan opposition behind one leader. During his 11 years in power, Mr Maduro has managed to run rings around the opposition time and time again, aided by the fact that opposition leaders often seemed to spend more time attacking each other than concentrating on beating him.  And maybe it was that nervousness which led Mr Maduro not just to predict a victory in the upcoming election - something many candidates do - but to add that he would win ""by hook or by crook"". To opposition activists who have long bemoaned being the victims of government harassment, the president's remark came as no surprise.  But it is nevertheless a telling slip of the tongue from the leader of a movement which likes to portray itself as representing a mass of Venezuelans, whose loyal support, they argue, has afforded it many an election victory and kept it in power without interruption since 1999.  It is not the first time Mr Maduro's words have raised eyebrows.  Mr Maduro's detractors have long made fun of his verbal gaffes and his humble beginnings as a bus driver.  But the 61-year-old has used his past to his advantage, cultivating his image as a ""man of the people"", dancing salsa with his wife during his rambling TV shows and never missing an occasion to whack a baseball, throw a basketball or spar with a boxer.  And while he never achieved the popularity among Chavistas that his predecessor Hugo Chávez had, he has so far managed to remain the movement's uncontested leader.  This was far from a given when he was picked by Hugo Chávez in 2012 as his heir after the latter was diagnosed with cancer.  Many had thought Chávez would choose Diosdado Cabello, a fiery and combative military man, for the role of acting president while the ailing leader was receiving treatment in Cuba.  But Chávez instead anointed Mr Maduro, whom he had just named vice-president after serving six years as Chávez's foreign minister. Following Chávez's death in March 2013, Mr Maduro narrowly won the election the president's death had triggered, defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles by 1.6 percentage points - a result Mr Capriles disputed. In 2018, Mr Maduro sailed to victory by a wide margin in elections which were roundly dismissed as neither free nor fair.  The main opposition coalition had decided to boycott the polls after a raft of candidates were arrested or had fled the country, leaving the field virtually empty for Mr Maduro.  Arguably, one of Mr Maduro's main achievements has been how he has managed over the past 11 years not only to prevent any challenges to his rule within his PSUV party, but also to form strong alliances with those who have backed him.  His defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, has been in the post for almost a decade, ensuring that the armed forces remain behind him. The support of the armed forces was key when the then leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself the rightful president in January 2019, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election in 2018 had been fraudulent.  The hope of the opposition that Mr Guaidó would replace Mr Maduro in the presidential palace was soon quashed, with all the major institutions remaining under the firm control of the government.  Allies of Mr Maduro also control the main electoral body, the Supreme Court and the Attorney-General's office, among others. Suspicious of outsiders, he surrounds himself with a close-knit group of trusted politicians, whom he rotates through different high-ranking posts.  Among them is Delcy Rodríguez, who has served as his communications minister, his foreign minister and most recently, as his vice-president.  Her brother Jorge is another close Maduro ally, who currently heads the government-controlled National Assembly.  Mr Maduro and some in his inner circle - including his defence minister - have been further welded together by being charged by the US authorities in 2020 with ""narco-terrorism"" and drug trafficking.   The president used the indictment to portray himself as a fighter against ""US imperialist forces"", which he claims are targeting him because he ""stands up for the people"". He also blames US sanctions for the dire economic crisis which Venezuela has suffered under his leadership.  Almost eight million Venezuelans have left the country over the past decade, driven out by a combination of widespread shortages and increasing political repression.  To stop the economy's freefall, in 2019 Mr Maduro relaxed some of the strict foreign currency regulations brought in by Chávez. Shortages have eased since then, but those without access to foreign currency continue to struggle. Opinion polls suggest Mr Maduro's popularity has plummeted over the years, in large part because of the economic downturn he has presided over. Nevertheless, his socialist PSUV party can still draw on a hard core of supporters, as well as considerable number of people who have benefited financially from his rule.  His government's actions in recent months, however, appear to betray his worry that his powerful party machine may not be able to win the election if the vote is free and fair.  First, the comptroller-general, a government ally, banned his foremost rival, María Corina Machado, from running for office - a decision which was later confirmed by the government-controlled Supreme Court. Then, the woman whom the opposition coalition had chosen to replace her on the ballot was prevented from registering.  Finally, a relatively unknown former diplomat, Edmundo González, was confirmed as the opposition coalition's unity candidate in April.  Mr González has sailed past Mr Maduro in the opinion polls in record time, with some giving the 74-year-old a lead of 40% over the president.  In response, Mr Maduro's rhetoric has become more belligerent, even evoking the risk of a ""civil war"" should he lose.  “If you don't want a bloodbath in Venezuela, a civil war brought about by the fascists, then let's strive for the biggest success, the biggest victory in the electoral history of our people,"" he told voters less than two weeks before the election.  Invoking a bloodbath may seem extreme, but Mr Maduro has much to lose, were he to be defeated at the polls. Not only has the US offered a $15m reward (£11.6m) for his capture on ""narcoterrorism"" charges, but he is also under investigation at the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity committed by the security forces during the crackdown on a wave of anti-government protests in 2017.  No one should be surprised if, faced with an election defeat, the former bus driver refuses to accept that he has reached the end of the line.  Many fear he will not go quietly.

718,Sinner out of Olympics with tonsillitis,"Jannik Sinner was a key part of Italy's Davis Cup victory at the end of 2023 World number one Jannik Sinner has withdrawn from the Paris Olympics with tonsillitis. The Italian struggled with illness during his Wimbledon quarter-final loss to Daniil Medvedev earlier in July. Sinner was one of the favourites for the gold medal on the Paris clay, reaching the French Open semi-finals after winning his first major title at the Australian Open in January. ""After a good week of clay training I started to feel unwell,"" the 22-year-old posted on X., external ""I spent a couple of days resting and during a visit the doctor found tonsillitis and strongly advised me against playing. ""Missing the Games is a huge disappointment as it was one of my main goals for this season."" The tennis tournament takes place from 27 July to 4 August. All you need to know about Paris 2024 How City of Light changed the Olympics Sinner had been due to play singles and doubles at Roland Garros. His withdrawal means that Novak Djokovic will be the top seed in the singles when the draw is made on Thursday. A number of players will miss the Paris Games, either through illness or injury. Later on Wednesday, Denmark's Holger Rune, the world number 16, announced his withdrawal because of wrist pain. ""I am really sorry that I will be unable to play the Olympics. It's something I've been looking forward to playing and being a part of,"" Rune said on X. Marketa Vondrousova, silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, pulled out on Tuesday with a hand injury, while Polish world number seven Hubert Hurkacz also withdrew. Other notable absentees include Britain's Emma Raducanu, world number three Aryna Sabalenka and two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur. But Djokovic, Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz and US Open winner Coco Gauff are all slated to play. The Olympics take place just 13 days after Wimbledon ended and finish three weeks before the US Open begins. The Olympic tennis competition consists of men's and women's singles and doubles, as well as the mixed doubles. Andy Murray is set to compete for Great Britain as he ends his playing career, with Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie also in Paris in singles. Murray will play doubles with Evans, while Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski are real medal contenders in the same event. Katie Boulter is the sole British representative in the women's singles and will play doubles with Heather Watson. Watson and Salisbury will also compete in the mixed doubles.

717,'Right time' for me to retire - Murray,"This video can not be played Paris 2024: Andy Murray tells BBC sports editor Dan Roan it is the 'right time' to retire from tennis Andy Murray says it is the ""right time"" for him to retire from tennis after the Paris Olympics - and he is ""happy"" with the decision. The two-time Olympic singles champion confirmed on Tuesday the Games, where he will play in the doubles with Dan Evans, will be his final event. Murray, 37, said recent injuries, which prevented him playing singles in his Wimbledon farewell earlier this month, mean he is now content with ending his career. ""I didn't feel that way a few months ago when I thought that this is when I was going to stop,"" said the Scot in his first interview since the announcement. ""I didn't want to. Now I want to.  ""I know it is the right time for me."" All you need to know about Paris 2024 How City of Light changed the Olympics Murray, who has been hampered by a series of injuries in recent years, said in February he did not plan to play beyond the summer, but did not give an indication of when his final tournament would be. An ankle injury in March and a back issue which required surgery in June put emotional farewells at Wimbledon and the Olympics - titles he won twice in his glittering career - in jeopardy, but he was able to play doubles with his brother Jamie at Wimbledon, where they lost in the first round. Murray said his back issue will likely prevent him from entering the singles in Paris - a decision which must be made before Thursday's draw - but he and Evans are capable of doing ""very well"" in the doubles. ""Me and Dan made the commitment to each other, that is what we will prioritise,"" he added. ""That gives the team and us the best opportunity to get a medal.  ""My back is still not perfect. I didn't feel great in the build-up to Wimbledon and during it. I feel better here."" Evans will still play in the men's singles, along with Cameron Norrie and Jack Draper, while Team GB will also be represented in the doubles by Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury. Either British pair could be drawn against high-profile opponents, including 14-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal and his fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz – the Roland Garros and Wimbledon champion. Murray's final match at Wimbledon was expected to be in the mixed doubles with Emma Raducanu but his fellow Briton pulled out to protect a wrist issue that threatened her campaign in the singles. Speaking for the first time on the incident, Murray said he and Raducanu have not spoken since her withdrawal, but he respected her decision. ""Getting to finish playing at Wimbledon on Centre Court with my brother was unbelievably special,"" he added. ""It is something we never experienced. That wasn't how I planned it, but that is how it ended up and I am really happy about that. I am not frustrated or bitter about it."" Asked about his plans following retirement, Murray said he wanted to spend more time with his family, ""become a scratch golfer"" but would ""love"" to be involved in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics ""in some capacity"". ""I don't know what the rest of my life will look like,"" he added. ""I will still stay in touch with the sport."" Murray famously won Olympic singles gold at London 2012, beating Swiss great Roger Federer on Wimbledon's Centre Court, and then defended his title in Rio de Janeiro four years later. ""Every time I have come to the Olympics it feels totally different [to other tennis events] and I personally love it. For me it has been an amazing experience,"" he said. ""I love being around athletes, being part of the team, representing my country. For me it has been right up there.""

714,'Circus' football opener 'pathetic' - Mascherano,"This video can not be played Watch the story of Argentina's game against Morocco that lasted four hours Argentina coach Javier Mascherano has described the chaotic ending to his team's  2-1 loss to Morocco in the men's Olympic football tournament as a ""disgrace"" and ""a circus"". Crowd trouble forced the first football match of Paris 2024 to be suspended for nearly two hours, with the game eventually completed in an empty stadium. With Morocco leading 2-1 Argentina appeared to level the match 16 minutes into second-half injury time, which sparked bottles being thrown on to the turf and a pitch invasion by some supporters in Morocco colours. The referee led both sets of players off the pitch at 16:05 BST, with the match resuming at 18:00 after fans had left the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne. Shortly before restarting, Argentina's equaliser was ruled out for offside following intervention from the video assistant referee (VAR). Morocco held on to their lead across three additional minutes. Former midfielder Javier Mascherano is a two-time gold medallist with Argentina Morocco beat Argentina in game marred by crowd trouble ""I have not been a coach for long, but never in my career as a player have I seen a situation like that,"" said Mascherano, who won gold with Argentina in 2004 and 2008. ""It is a circus. But that is how it is. We cannot control it. I told the boys that now we need to look forward, try to get the six points that will allow us to qualify and that all this should fill us with energy and anger for what we have ahead of us."" For some time the outcome of the match was unclear, with the official International Olympic Committee (IOC) website indicating it had ended. Mascherano said the team captains initially ""decided not to play on"" and that the organiser ""called Fifa"" - world football's governing body - before deciding to restart the match. ""It is a disgrace that this should happen and poison the tournament. This wouldn't even happen in a neighbourhood tournament. It's pathetic,"" he added. ""Beyond the Olympic spirit, the organisation needs to be up to standard and at the moment, unfortunately, it is not."" A statement from the tournament organisers said: ""The football match between Argentina and Morocco at the Saint-Etienne Stadium was suspended due to a pitch invasion by a small number of spectators. ""The match then restarted and was able to conclude safely. Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions.""

715,Dupont inspires France as party starts in Paris,"This video can not be played Watch the tries of the day from the men's rugby sevens pool matches Antoine Dupont underlined why he is one of the faces of the Paris Olympics with a stunning solo try as France secured a spot in the quarter-finals of the men's rugby sevens. While the opening ceremony does not take place until Friday, rugby sevens was chosen as one of the curtain-raising events to get the party started in the French capital. A boisterous and celebratory atmosphere greeted the home players in a near-80,000 crowd in the nation's largest stadium. But France started tentatively with a 12-12 draw against the United States in their opening Pool C match. A joyful mood then turned nervy as Uruguay led their second outing until scrum-half Dupont swung the game in their favour. His scurrying run, demonstrating both his speed and strength, put France 12-7 ahead and laid the platform for Les Bleus to go on and win 19-12. Ireland have joined the hosts in the last eight after winning both of their Pool A matches on the first day of Games action. This video can not be played Dupont try extends France's lead against Uruguay Dupont is a megastar in the 15-a-side ranks, captain of his country and voted 2021 World Player of the Year, and switching to the smaller format has been a huge fillip for the event. The 27-year-old decided to skip the Six Nations earlier this year to prioritise his nation's bid for sevens glory on home soil. After an initially frosty response, that decision appears to have eventually further endeared Dupont to the French public. The biggest sports paper, L'Equipe, lauded him over Wednesday’s front pages,  before an idolising Stade de France crowd  regularly chanted his name. ""The atmosphere was good and helped us to win,"" said Dupont. ""Maybe we did not do our best but hopefully it is going to help us more in the next game. “We need to raise our level. If not, we will not go too far. We need to be focused on the game and not distracted, because we are capable of better."" France are second in the pool, behind Fiji, with five points from their opening two matches. The top two teams from three pools go through to the knockout stage, while the two best third-placed sides also advance. France next play defending Olympic champions Fiji, who beat both Uruguay and the US, in their final pool match on Thursday which means they are assured of qualification. Despite being drawn in what was seemingly a tough pool, Ireland breezed through without the need to beat New Zealand in their final match on Thursday. James Topping's side, which also features 15-a-side converts such as Hugo Keenan, harbours hopes of a medal and illustrated why with an opening 10-5 win over South Africa. That was backed up by an emphatic 40-5 victory over Japan to the delight of the Irish fans present.

716,Whistleblower behind Dujardin video wants to 'save dressage',"This video can not be played Charlotte Dujardin: Video shows Olympian whipping horse The whistleblower who released a video that appears to show Charlotte Dujardin ""excessively"" whipping a horse during a training session did so in a bid to ""save dressage"", says her lawyer. Britain's Dujardin, a six-time Olympic dressage medallist, withdrew from the Paris Games on Tuesday after the video emerged, saying it showed her ""making an error of judgement"". The video, obtained by the BBC, shows Dujardin repeatedly whipping a horse around its legs during the session. After her withdrawal from the Olympics, the 39-year-old was provisionally suspended by equestrian's governing body the FEI, which received the footage on Monday. Dujardin said in a statement: ""What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse. ""I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment."" Speaking to BBC Sport, the whistleblower's lawyer, Stephan Wensing, said his client had mixed feelings about the reaction since the news broke, but she believed it is a widespread issue in dressage. ""It's not fun to ruin a career. She's not celebrating; she doesn't feel like a hero,"" he said. ""But she told me this morning this had to be done because she wants to save dressage."" The Charlotte Dujardin case explained GB's Dujardin given provisional ban and out of Games Equestrian at the Paris 2024 Olympics On Wednesday Dujardin had her UK Sport funding suspended pending the outcome of the FEI investigation, while she has also been dropped as an ambassador for horse welfare charity Brooke, which said it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the video. ""Our whole ethos is around kindness and compassion to horses, and to see the opposite of this from someone with such a high profile is beyond disappointing,"" it said. Two of Dujardin's sponsors, equestrian insurance company KBIS and Danish equestrian equipment company Equine LTS, have removed their backing. Equite LTS said they are ""shocked and saddened by the video"" and ""do not condone this form of behaviour"". KBIS said they ""cannot and will not condone behaviour"" that goes against providing the ""best care possible"" for horses. Dujardin had been set to compete in both the individual dressage and team event alongside Carl Hester and world champion Lottie Fry, on horse Imhotep. She needed a medal of any colour to take the outright lead as most-decorated British female Olympian from now-retired cyclist Dame Laura Kenny. Charlotte Dujardin has been replaced by Becky Moody On Tuesday Dujardin said the video was ""filmed four years ago"", but Wensing said it was from two and a half years ago. ""When she filmed this and was aware of this two and a half years ago, she was thinking everything this superstar, the best rider, is doing, must be OK. This must be the way to train horses and how to deal with it,"" he said. ""Charlotte Dujardin was explaining during the lesson that she wanted the horse lifting the legs up more in canter. ""Later on, [the whistleblower] was thinking 'this is not OK'. She had spoken with several people in the profession and they all warned her 'don’t fight'. ""She was really afraid. There was a sort of fear culture and she was also thinking 'when I do something, it will be victim-blaming'."" The timing of the release of the video has also been questioned, with Madeleine Hill, a former dressage reporter for magazine Horse & Hound, telling the BBC Radio 4 Today programme it felt like ""sabotage"". She believes the FEI should have waited until after the Olympics before imposing any sanctions, adding that ""top riders are being persecuted"" on social media by people who are against the use of horses in sport. However, Wensing said it was the recent removal of a rider from the Denmark dressage team that encouraged his client to report Dujardin. Earlier this month Danish TV station TV2 reported, external that Denmark's reserve rider Carina Cassoe Kruth had been replaced in the Paris squad on the eve of the team announcement after a controversial training video was sent to the Danish Riding Association. Kruth told TV2 she ""deeply regretted"" her ""clear error"". ""Because of the Olympics, [the whistleblower] was thinking if I don't do anything now [Dujardin] will probably win medals,"" Wensing said. ""On the other hand, people are thinking wrong that she could have done this during the Olympics, and that would destroy the whole British team. ""Now the team can organise themselves and use the alternate. It's not like the whole British dressage team has gone now. There could be a worse timing.""",2024-07-24 23:10:57,https://www.bbc.com/sport/equestrian/articles/cw0y240r78qo,Laura Scott,2024-07-24 23:10:57,,True
725,Not an oeuf: Athletes report eggs shortage in Olympic village,"Several athletes have complained about a shortage of food at the Olympic Village in Paris, according to reports. Competitors have said the amount of food available, specifically eggs, which were rationed at breakfast on Wednesday, and grilled meats, is insufficient, according to the French newspaper L'Équipe. The official catering partner to the Olympic Village, Sodexo Live!, confirmed ""a very high demand"" for certain products and said that ""volumes will be increased"" to ""satisfy the needs of the athletes"". The Olympic Village is set to serve approximately 13 million meals during the Olympic and Paralympic Games. ""It was requested to revise upwards the quantities initially planned, which the group will be able to satisfy,"" a spokesman for the Carrefour group, which is in charge of supplying fresh products to the Olympic Village, confirmed. Feeding 15,000 international athletes from 208 territories and nations, plus support teams, officials and volunteers, is a gargantuan task. During the two 15-day periods of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, more than 13 million meals will be served - the equivalent of the amount of food provided at 10 football World Cups. Athletes have access to six main areas devoted to French, Asian, Afro-Caribbean and world cuisine, with 500 different recipes catering to a wide variety of tastes. A strict quality charter also governed the food at the Paris Olympics. It was developed over the course of four years of work with the goal of halving the carbon footprint of meals produced during the Games, in comparison to London 2012. As a result, a quarter of all ingredients will be sourced in a 250km radius from Paris, and 20% will be certified organic. All meat, milk and eggs will be from France, and a third of the food will be plant-based. Two hundred water, juice and soda fountains have been installed in the Olympic Village, and only reusable cups and crockery will be offered.",2024-07-25 23:11:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0xj26w651qo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

The Friends actress, 55, posted a 2021 interview with Mr Vance that has been widely shared since his selection as Mr Trump's running mate for November's presidential election. ""I truly can’t believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""All I can say is… Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Mr Vance has a two-year-old daughter, and two sons.  ""I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,"" Ms Aniston wrote. ""Because you are trying to take that away from her, too."" The actress has previously spoken openly about her struggles while trying to have children through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Last month, Mr Vance voted to block Democrat-proposed legislation to guarantee access to IVF nationwide. Ahead of that vote, Mr Vance and the other 48 Senate Republicans signed a letter saying they supported IVF, but that the Democratic bill was overly broad and ""false fearmongering"". In the clip, Mr Vance criticised Vice-President Kamala Harris because she has no biological children. Ms Harris is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children. But Mr Vance told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson the US was run by ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too"". ""Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,"" he said. ""How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?"" Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, posted a reaction to Mr Vance's comments on Instagram on Thursday. “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I?” the 25-year-old daughter of Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and his ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, wrote. Cole Emhoff is her 29-year-old brother. The BBC has contacted the Trump-Vance campaign team for comment. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also addressed the comments earlier this week, speaking about adopting twins with his husband, Chasten. ""The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,"" Mr Buttigieg told CNN’s The Source programme. ""He couldn’t have known that - but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children."" There has also been backlash from fans of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who has no children - and three cats. ""It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is Taylor Swift,"" British writer Caitlin Moran posted on X. Another X user shared the Time magazine cover where Swift posed with one of her cats, writing: ""Hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate."" In 2022, Aniston told Allure she wished someone had told her to freeze her eggs. ""It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,"" she said. ""All the years and years of speculation... it was really hard.  ""I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it."" But she had ""zero regrets"". ""I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today,"" she told the magazine.

720,Netanyahu meets Biden to close 'gaps' on Gaza ceasefire deal,"Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu have met in an effort to close the remaining ""gaps"" in the push for a Gaza ceasefire deal, the White House said. The meeting at the White House came a day after Mr Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress as thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside. US Vice-President Kamala Harris later met Mr Netanyahu and said she had voiced ""serious concerns"" over casualties in Gaza.  The Israeli prime minister faces pressure both at home and abroad to bring an end to the Israel-Gaza war, now in its ninth month. He said he had known the US president for 40 years - and that Mr Biden had known every Israeli PM over the last half a century. ""From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu also said he looked forward to working with Mr Biden ""on the great issues before us"" over the next several months.  The US president joked that Golda Meir was the first Israeli PM that Mr Biden had met, and that Yitzhak Rabin, a successor, was there as an assistant. The meeting follows months of tension over the war in Gaza, with Mr Biden reaching the point in May, according to his friend and former defence secretary Chuck Hagel, where he said ""enough is enough"".   Mr Biden also previously publicly threatened to hold back weapons shipments if Israel launched a large-scale ground offensive in Rafah, prompting anger in Israel. Mr Netanyahu said in June it was ""inconceivable"" for the Biden administration to withhold weapons and ammunition from Israel.  At a news briefing, national security spokesman John Kirby said the pair discussed the urgent need for a hostage release deal, the potential of conflict spilling over into Lebanon, the threat of Iran and the need to reach ""compromises"" in peace talks.  While Mr Kirby added that ""gaps remain"" in the US-Israel relationship, it was still ""healthy"". ""By healthy, I mean they're not going to agree on everything,"" Mr Kirby said, adding that Mr Biden was ""very comfortable with the relationship he has with the prime minister"".  Speaking to reporters after her own meeting with Mr Netanyahu, Vice-President Harris said the discussion was ""frank and constructive"". Ms Harris is the likely Democratic presidential nominee now that Mr Biden has stepped down from his re-election campaign.  She said she has an ""unwavering commitment"" to Israel and its right to defend itself.  Ms Harris also expressed, however, ""serious concerns"" about Israeli operations in Gaza and the ""dire humanitarian situation there"".  ""I will not be silent,"" she added. ""It is time for this war to end."" ""Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war,"" she added. ""Let's bring the hostages home, and let's bring much-needed relief to the Palestinian people.""  The US and Israeli leaders also held a closed-door meeting with the families of seven US citizens still being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.  Following the meeting, Jonathan Dekel-Chen - whose son Sagui was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October - told reporters that the meeting was ""productive and honest"", although he did not provide details.  ""We feel probably more optimistic than we have since the first round of releases in late November, early December,"" he said.  Speaking in the House chamber on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu defended Israel's war in Gaza, while attempting to rally support from US politicians.  ""Our enemies are your enemies,"" he said, condemning protesters as ""Iran's useful idiots"". The White House pushed back on Mr Netanyahu's characterisation of the protesters, with Mr Kirby saying that ""it's not a phrase we would use"" and ""not a reflection of what we think"" of the ""mostly peaceful"" protests.  Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Washington to accuse Mr Netanyahu of being a ""war criminal"".  Their loudspeakers and chanting could be clearly heard from the White House as Mr Netanyahu arrived on Thursday.  Police arrested 23 people on Wednesday, including five inside the Capitol building. Mr Netanyahu's speech was occasionally met with rapturous applause, mostly led by Republicans. The Gaza war has deepened political divides in Washington, and led to infighting among Democrats, whose left wing has been critical of US support of Israel. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was spotted sitting in the audience holding a sign that read ""guilty of genocide"".  Ms Harris did not attend Mr Netanyahu's speech due to scheduling conflicts, the White House said.  Instead, she spent part of the day speaking to a crowd from the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta.  Ms Harris has expressed steadfast support for Israel. However, such a stance has been politically costly for the Democrats.  Hundreds of thousands of protest votes were cast against Mr Biden during the presidential primaries by those wanting him to stop sending military aid to Israel.  Some of those angered by his war stance see Ms Harris as a chance to mend the fracture in the party, and win back the votes.  Mr Netanyahu is expected to visit Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Friday.",2024-07-25 23:11:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3eppp0n57o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
728,Dujardin condemned by GB team-mate Hester,"Dujardin (left) and Hester won bronze together in the team dressage event at Tokyo in 2021 A group of leading dressage riders have condemned the actions of Charlotte Dujardin - with signatories including her long-time Team GB colleague Carl Hester. Dujardin, Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian, pulled out of Paris 2024 on Tuesday after a video emerged of her ""excessively"" whipping a horse. She has since been provisionally suspended by equestrian's governing body the FEI. In a statement, the board members of the International Dressage Riders Club (IDRC) said they ""universally condemn"" the actions of Dujardin. ""The board members are resolute that equine welfare must always be placed uppermost and at all times,"" they said on Thursday. ""The IDRC Board supports the actions taken by the FEI, the British Equestrian Federation and British Dressage to provisionally suspend Ms Dujardin."" Hester, who will compete in his seventh Olympics next week, was one of 10 board members of the IDRC to sign the statement. He won gold alongside Dujardin in the team dressage event at London 2012, while they claimed silver together four years later in Rio and bronze at Tokyo 2020. The Charlotte Dujardin case explained Whistleblower behind Dujardin video wants to 'save dressage' GB's Dujardin given provisional ban and out of Games Dujardin had been set to compete in both the individual dressage and team event alongside Hester and world champion Lottie Fry, on horse Imhotep. The three-time Olympic gold medallist said she was ""deeply ashamed"" and that her actions were ""completely out of character"". Both British Equestrian (BEF) and British Dressage (BD) have imposed a provisional suspension on Dujardin pending the outcome of the FEI investigation. On Wednesday, Dujardin had her UK Sport funding suspended pending the investigation, while she was dropped as an ambassador for horse welfare charity Brooke. Equestrian insurance company KBIS and Danish equestrian equipment company Equine LTS terminated their sponsorship deals with her on Wednesday. Two more sponsors followed suit on Thursday, with riding helmets manufacturer Charles Owen and Fairfax Saddles ending their association with Dujardin. The London International Horse Show also dropped Dujardin as an ambassador. Meanwhile, Team GB chef de mission Mark England said Dujardin had been offered support from the British Elite Athletes Association. ""She's going through a difficult time,"" England told BBC Sport. ""What's important is, as a valued member of Team GB and as an Olympic champion, that we do wrap some care around her. ""It is a very difficult error of judgement by her standards and by her own admission. We wish her well but we don't condone what has happened. ""Animal welfare and the welfare of everybody in Team GB is really important."" This video can not be played Charlotte Dujardin: Video shows Olympian whipping horse during training Ingmar de Vos, president of the FEI, said he was ""very shocked and disappointed"" when he saw the video of Dujardin whipping a horse's legs. The footage shows Dujardin, 39, hitting a horse with a long equestrian whip. Whips are used in all equestrian disciplines and when employed as a training aid should be utilised lightly to communicate with the horse. De Vos told BBC Sport: ""We have many riders, we have many athletes, many horses in our sport, so it is only a very low percentage, but every case is a case too much. ""So that is why we need to constantly educate our athletes and their entourage because what was allowed 30 years ago or accepted 30 years ago is probably not any more today."" Animal rights charity Peta has called for the removal of equestrian events from the Olympic programme. However, De Vos believes equestrian events - eventing, dressage, show jumping - will be at the Los Angeles Games in 2028 and Brisbane in 2032. ""I'm very confident because we've been doing so much for horse welfare. We will be on the programme in Los Angeles and we will also be in Brisbane,"" he said.

729,"Biles, Djokovic & Lyles - global stars to follow at Paris 2024","Novak Djokovic, Simone Biles and Noah Lyles are among the biggest names in Paris About 10,500 athletes from around the world will compete in 32 sports at the Olympic Games in Paris this summer. BBC Sport looked at Team GB's hopes earlier this week, so now we are putting the spotlight on the big stars, stories and stats from a global perspective.  The five-time world champion is set to be one the faces of the Games and is tipped to deliver multiple gold medals in the pool. When 22-year-old Marchand is not studying computer science at university in the United States, he has been breaking records for fun. That included the great Michael Phelps' 400m individual medley world record - which had stood for 15 years - in 2023. The son of two Olympic swimmers, Marchand is world champion in the 200m individual medley, 400m individual medley and 200m butterfly. He is aiming to become the first swimmer to win the 200m breaststroke and 200m butterfly double at the Olympics - but to do so will have to race in the two events on the same days. In all, Marchand, who is coached by Phelps' former coach, will have the chance for four individual gold medals in front of his home fans. Three years ago many people thought they might have seen the world's most decorated gymnast at an Olympics for the last time. Biles pulled out of several events at the Tokyo Games after suffering with the 'twisties' - a loss of spatial awareness while performing twisting moves - when she was favourite to add to her four Olympic gold medals. She made an emotional return to win bronze on the beam, her seventh Olympic medal. She then took time away from the sport before returning to competition in June 2023. Biles has since added five World Championship medals, including four golds, and has been working regularly with a therapist. ""I feel very confident with where I'm at mentally and physically, that [Tokyo] is not going to happen again just because we have put in the work,"" she said this year. An Olympic gold is the only big prize missing from 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's collection. He has made no secret that being on top of the podium at Paris 2024 is his main goal this year. At Tokyo 2020, when on course for a 'Golden Slam' - all four majors plus Olympic gold - he lost to eventual champion Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals and was also defeated in the bronze medal match. Djokovic has a history of bouncing back after adversity and will be expected to feed off that huge disappointment this time round. But the 37-year-old is not having his best year, failing to win a title and no longer sitting top of the world rankings. Injury cut short his French Open before the quarter-finals and, although he reached the Wimbledon final this month with strapping on a knee, he was comprehensively outplayed by Carlos Alcaraz. However, if he is fit, an improvement on the bronze he won at Beijing 2008 could well be on the cards. Can anyone stop the seven-time Olympic champion? Set to appear at her fourth Games, 27-year-old Ledecky is one gold medal away from drawing level with compatriot Jenny Thompson as the most successful female Olympic swimmer of all time. She has the chance to claim the record outright as she is expected to compete in four events - 400m freestyle, 800m freestyle, 1500m freestyle and 4x200m relay. With 10 medals already, Ledecky can also break Thompson's record of 12 for the most won by an American woman. Ledecky is favourite to defend the 800m and 1500 freestyle titles - events where she is also the world record holder. There is a tiny glimmer of hope for her rivals, however, with Ledecky suffering her first defeat in 13 years in an 800m freestyle final in February when she was stunned by Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh.  The American sprinter has set himself some huge goals. He is aiming to become the first man to win four gold medals on the track at the same Olympics, targeting success in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m and 4x400m relays. He won gold in the first three of those events at the World Championships last year and is hoping to claim a place in the 4x400m team after making his debut in the event at the indoor Worlds. As if that isn't enough, he has also spoken of wanting to beat Jamaican great Usain Bolt's 100m and 200m world records. Since taking 200m bronze at Tokyo 2020, Lyles has dominated the sprints on the global stage and displays the talent and flamboyance that could fill the void left by Bolt when he retired in 2017. A double Olympic 1500m champion and the world record holder over the distance, Kipyegon has said she is ""looking forward to a bright summer"". The 30-year-old is chasing two gold medals in Paris as she seeks to repeat the 1500m-5,000m double she achieved at last year's World Championships. She is also a former 5,000m world record holder, setting her mark in Paris last year in her first race over the distance in eight years. It has since been beaten by Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay.  Kipyegon began her athletics career at 16 and won her first individual global title running barefoot at the World Junior Cross Country Championships in 2011. She has spoken about how becoming a mother in 2018 has changed her mentality. Three of her four world titles have come since giving birth. Dupont made headlines last year when he announced he was swapping XVs for sevens to fulfil a dream of playing at a home Olympics. Regarded by many as the best player in the world at the XV-a-side game, France captain and scrum-half Dupont sat out this year's Six Nations to focus on the World Rugby sevens circuit. He inspired France to their first men's sevens title in 19 years in Los Angeles in March, having helped them to bronze in his debut tournament in Vancouver. ""We're a very ambitious squad who are looking to claim a gold medal. We're all aiming for it,"" the 27-year-old said. Other sides boast better credentials. Since sevens was introduced at the Games in 2016, Fiji have won both men's gold medals. France were beaten by Japan in the quarter-finals at Rio 2016 and did not qualify for Tokyo 2020. However, France have already secured a place in the quarter-finals in Paris - where the sevens action started on Wednesday - and Dupont scored a stunning solo try to underline why he is one of the faces of these Games. He has superstar status in India and nine million Instagram followers. The first Indian athlete to win an Olympic track and field gold, Chopra will be aiming to defend his javelin title in Paris. His stunning success in Tokyo, where he also became the first Asian athlete to win Olympic javelin gold, has since been backed up by a world title. Among those likely to challenge him are Arshad Nadeem from Pakistan - India's great sporting rivals. Nadeem boasts his own slice of history after becoming the first athlete from Pakistan to qualify for an Olympic track and field final at Tokyo 2020. He took silver behind Chopra at last year's World Championships and can become his country's first Olympic medallist in athletics. The four-time world champion was in danger of missing the Games because of a ban imposed for refusing to shake the hand of a Russian opponent. Kharlan was disqualified from last year's World Championships after offering her sabre to tap blades instead of shaking hands following victory over Anna Smirnova.  But International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach wrote a letter to Kharlan saying it would ""allocate an additional quota place"" to her if she could not qualify because of her ""unique situation"". The four-time Olympic medallist has pledged to bring ""hope"" to Ukrainians amid the ongoing war following Russia's invasion more than two years ago. No Russian or Belarusian fencers have been invited to participate as neutral athletes in Paris, a situation 33-year-old Kharlan described as ""a success"". NBA great Stephen Curry will make his Olympic debut in Paris. The Golden State Warriors point guard is part of star-studded USA men's team who will be aiming to add to their 16 Olympic gold medals. They have won every gold since 2004. An Olympic medal is pretty much the only thing missing from Curry's collection, which includes four NBA titles, two NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards and two World Cups. He is also the NBA’s all-time three-point record holder. LeBron James, the all-time NBA leading points scorer, will play at the Games for the first time since London 2012, while Kevin Durant is seeking to become the first male athlete to win four basketball gold medals. She is 37 and has had an up-and-down season but count out Fraser-Pryce at your peril in her fifth and final Olympics. ""It’s never over until it’s over,"" the three-time Olympic champion said this month. Five-time 100m world champion Fraser-Pryce has struggled with injuries this season but will compete in her signature event in Paris along with team-mate Shericka Jackson, who is chasing her first individual Olympic gold medal. They will be in the 4x100m relay team as Jamaica seek to defend their title. German equestrian athlete Isabell Werth, 55, has never failed to win a gold medal at any Olympics she has competed at. Heading to her seventh Games, she will be hoping to add to her seven golds and five silvers and extend her record as the most decorated rider in Olympic history. Georgian pistol shooter Nino Salukvadze, who is also 55, will feature at her 10th Olympics, equalling the record held by Canadian equestrian athlete Ian Millar. Salukvadze will be the first to do so in consecutive Games. In Greco-Roman wrestling, Cuba's Mijain Lopez could become the first athlete in any sport to win five individual golds consecutively. Australian Jess Fox has been dominating canoe slalom and, with the new discipline of kayak cross, may become the first person to win three canoe golds at the same Games. In table tennis, Bruna Alexandre of Brazil will be in the women's singles at the Olympics before competing at the Paralympics to become only the second athlete in her sport to achieve the feat after Natalia Partyka. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/extra/xawtd9l5mx/visual-guide-to-the-olympics",2024-07-25 23:11:22,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c97d1628y9no,Sonia Oxley,2024-07-25 23:11:22,,True
730,Paris set for its first Olympics in 100 years,"Olympic Phryge - based on a soft hat that was worn as a symbol of freedom during the French Revolution - is the official mascot of the Paris Olympic Games 'Games wide open' is the motto for this year's Paris Olympics, which officially begin on Friday with the opening ceremony. It is the first time in 100 years that the French capital has hosted the summer Games, with the majority of the events taking place in or around the city's most iconic areas. Friday's opening ceremony will see boats carry athletes and dignitaries down 6km of the River Seine, with room for 300,000 spectators. Few details are known about the event - though there has been speculation about Celine Dion and Lady Gaga performing - with the ceremony's artistic director Thomas Jolly saying he wants to ""show France in all its diversity"". The Paris Games is the first to achieve gender parity among athletes, with 5,250 male and 5,250 female athletes set to compete. With millions expected to attend the Games, Paris is making the final touches for a Games it hopes will be like no other. This video can not be played Paris Olympics 2024: We are ready and excited - deputy mayor Rabadan French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week, external that the country was ""ready and we will be ready throughout the Games"". However, some Parisians have used social media to warn people, external about issues such as overcrowding, price inflation and difficulties in getting around the city. There is a huge security operation in place, with up to 5,000 police, soldiers and hired guards on patrol at any one time. The Seine - the river than runs through the centre of Paris - has been fenced off for the opening ceremony, leaving residents needing QR codes to access certain areas. That has affected local businesses along the Seine, leading to some criticism,, external but French authorities say the barricades will be removed after Friday's event. The cost of this year's Games is expected to be about 9bn euros (£7.6bn), with the organising committee promising to make it the greenest Olympics in history. The Hotel de Ville - Paris City Hall - will host a fan park during the Games Only two arenas are new and purpose-built - an aquatics centre and an arena for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics. Other iconic venues such as the Stade de France - the national stadium - and French Open tennis venue Roland Garros will host events, alongside historic sites such as the Grand Palais and the Place de la Concorde. One of the big concerns in the build-up was the water quality of the Seine, which will host the swimming leg of the triathlon and open-water events. Swimming in the river was banned for a century because of the water quality, with tests in June still showing levels of E.coli above the upper limits imposed by sports federations. However, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river on 17 July to try to prove it was safe. The water will be tested regularly in different areas before the events. How is Paris preparing for Olympics and Paralympics? As the Olympics nears, Paris puts 75,000 troops on the streets There is only one new event at this year's Games - breaking, a style of dance that originated in the Bronx in New York. Some events have had tweaks, including men being eligible to compete in artistic synchronised swimming for the first time in Olympic history, although none have been selected for Paris. The Games will also be the final Olympics for some of Britain's finest.

A visual guide to the Olympics Who are the global stars at Paris 2024? The 24 British stars to watch at Paris 2024 Russia and its ally Belarus are banned from sending athletes to the Games amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 36 Russian and 24 Belarusian athletes who are in Paris will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (INA), which means there will be no national anthems or flags on display. Those who are competing had to meet strict criteria set out by the International Olympic Committee, such as not actively supporting the war, and then pass a vetting check by their national federation and the IOC. The decision to allow Russian and Belarusian nationals to compete has been criticised by some, but IOC president Thomas Bach defended the decision. Athletes gathered in the Olympic Village earlier this week with Bach, wearing scarves with the message ""give peace a chance"" on them. ""You, the Olympic athletes, are the peace ambassadors of our time,"" Bach said. ""You will compete fiercely against each other. At the same time, you are living peacefully together under one roof, here in the Olympic Village.  ""You are respecting the same rules and most importantly you are respecting each other. ""In this way, you are sending a resounding message of peace from Paris to the world.""

732,A visual guide to the Olympics,"Paris 2024, the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, is about to get under way.  But before it begins, let us take you on a journey through the history of the summer Olympics, and how it became the spectacle that it is today. The modern Olympic Games were founded in 1894 by French historian Pierre de Coubertin, with the first edition taking place in Athens in 1896. However, the history of the Olympics actually dates back nearly 3,000 years, to the original Games held on the Peloponnese in Ancient Greece. The actual birth year is not known, but ancient manuscripts suggest the year 776 BC.  These Games took place every four years, a period which became known as an ‘Olympiad’.  Participants had to be male, of Greek origin and freeborn, and all athletes competed naked. Wrestlers competed covered in oil, there were no weight classes in boxing, while anyone false-starting on the track faced corporal punishment.  Winners were rewarded with a wreath or crown of leaves and became immortalised.  The ancient Olympic Games ended in 393 AD, more than 1,000 years later.  The Paris 2024 Olympics will mark the 33rd edition of the modern Games, though three of those did not take place because of World War One and World War Two. Ancient Olympic sports The ancient Olympics featured more recognisable sports including running, long jump, discus, wrestling and boxing, as well as the likes of chariot racing and a primitive version of combat sport called pankration. Modern Olympic sports At the first version of the modern Olympics in 1896, nine sports were contested - athletics, cycling (road and track), fencing, gymnastics, shooting, swimming, tennis, weightlifting and wrestling. These sports remain on the Olympic programme to this day, but other sports have been and gone. Obstacle swimming, dumbbell lifts, underwater swim and running deer shooting (no live animals were used) are just four of the forgotten Olympic sports. The tug of war was contested at five Olympics, with Great Britain twice being crowned Olympic champions, while gold in the plunge for distance - at the 1904 Games - went to the diver who could travel the furthest underwater without moving their body, having jumped in, feet-first, from a standing position. New Olympic sports Host cities are able to propose sports they would like added to the Olympic programme when they stage the event.  At London 2012, women’s boxing was added to the programme, while tennis mixed doubles returned for the first time since 1924. The only sport making its debut in Paris is breaking, which combines athleticism and urban dance.  Climbing, skateboarding and surfing were retained from the Tokyo 2020 programme. In total, 329 events will be contested in Paris across 32 sports. If you’re reading this in Great Britain, chances are you can remember where you watched the remarkable opening ceremony of London 2012 - a stunning spectacle that will last long in the memory of the millions who tuned in worldwide. A feast for the senses, the opening ceremony of the Olympics is always a sight to behold - but certain protocol must be observed. This includes the revealing of the Olympic rings, the Olympic motto, the athletes’ parade, the Olympic oath and the lighting of the Olympic flame. The Paris 2024 opening ceremony - set to take place along the River Seine - gets under way at 18:30 BST on Friday, 26 July. The Olympic rings are the symbol of the Olympic movement, created in 1913 by De Coubertin. The logo represents the union of the five inhabited continents (at the time, the Americas were grouped together). The six colours - when combined with a white background - represented the colours on every competing country's flag at the time of the symbol’s creation. Each Olympic Games also has its own logo. The Paris 2024 logo combines three separate symbols, each reflecting a part of the Games’ identity and values. It is the first time the same emblem has been used for both the Olympics and Paralympics.  The gold medal - symbolises achievement The flame - symbolises energy Marianne - symbolises the French Republic The Olympic flame is a symbol of peace and friendship, and is transported in the Olympic torch. During the ancient Olympics, it was ignited by the sun’s rays and remained lit throughout the Games - traditions that have continued to the current day. Among the many great traditions of the Olympics is the torch relay. The Olympic torch carries the Olympic flame on a journey from Olympia, Greece, to the host city. The torch relay was first introduced at the 1936 Berlin Games. After the flame was lit in Olympia on 16 April, the Olympic torch arrived in France on 8 May and has since been on a journey across the country. When it arrives at the opening ceremony on 26 July, it will have been carried by some 10,000 torchbearers - including famous French sport stars Thierry Henry, Antoine Dupont and Charles Leclerc, plus the likes of Megan Rapinoe, Shaun White and even Halle Berry - through 400 towns and cities. The Olympic cauldron is lit by the final torchbearer at the opening ceremony and marks the symbolic start of the Olympic Games. It burns throughout the Games and is extinguished during the closing ceremony. Notable people to have had this honour at previous Games include Muhammad Ali (1996), Cathy Freeman (2000) and Naomi Osaka (2020). The original Olympic motto consisted of three Latin words - “Citius, Altius, Fortius”. In English, these words translate as “Faster, Higher, Stronger”. In 2021, an extra word was added to the motto - “Citius, Altius, Fortius – Communiter” - translating as “Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together”. The change was made to recognise the unifying power of sport. The Olympic oath is taken at the opening ceremony by an athlete of the host nation, representing all athletes. Since 1972, a judge has also sworn an oath, and since 2012, so too has a coach. Since the 2018 Winter Olympics, the oaths have been merged into one, each representative saying their own part - “in the name of the athletes”, “in the name of all judges” or “in the name of all the coaches and officials” - before the athlete recites the full oath. “We promise to take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules and in the spirit of fair play, inclusion and equality. Together we stand in solidarity and commit ourselves to sport without doping, without cheating, without any form of discrimination. We do this for the honour of our teams, in respect for the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, and to make the world a better place through sport.” Since the Winter Olympics of 1968, each edition of the Olympics has had an official mascot - a fictional ambassador that “embodies the spirit” of the Games. At London 2012, this was Wenlock - named after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Much Wenlock hosts the annual Wenlock Olympian Games, which are said to have been a source of inspiration for the modern Olympics for De Coubertin. Olympic Phryge is the mascot for Paris 2024. The name is based on the traditional small Phrygian hats the Olympic and Paralympic mascots are shaped after. It is a symbol of freedom through French history and represents allegorical figures of the French Republic. To date, 21 cities across the world have hosted the summer Olympics. Africa is the only continent never to have hosted a Games. Hosts are usually selected seven years in advance, with the selection process lasting approximately two years. Any city in the world can apply to become a host city, before the IOC’s executive board decides which cities will become official candidates. After a final shortlisting, the host city is chosen in a vote by IOC members. The 2024 Olympics come exactly 100 years after Paris last hosted the Games. Having also hosted it in 1900, it becomes only the second city after London to welcome the Olympics three times. The total budget of the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics is estimated to be about 8.9bn euros (£7.5bn), according to Statista. Roughly half is spent on infrastructure, with the remaining spent on operating costs. The Paris 2024 Organising Committee - which looks after competition, security and ticketing - has a budget of 4.38bn euros (£3.7bn), 1.2bn euros (£1bn) of which comes from the International Olympic Committee. The organisation of the Paris Olympics is 100% privately funded. The last Olympics in Tokyo had a total expenditure of $13bn (£10.1bn), while London 2012 cost £8.77bn. The IOC predicts the economic benefit of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics will be about $12.2bn (£9.4bn). One year after the London 2012 Olympics, the British government said the UK economy had seen a £9.9bn boost in trade and investment. Similarly, an independent study published earlier in 2024 said that the Paris Olympics will generate between 6.7bn and 11.1bn euros (£5.6-9.3bn) in net economic benefits in the Paris region. In addition to the economic benefit, one of the many upsides to hosting an Olympic Games is the historical trend towards the host nation achieving a greater medal tally than at the previous Games.  At the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, Japan won its highest number of medals to date (58), while Brazil, Great Britain, China, Greece and Australia all increased their medal hauls when they hosted the summer Games. However, other factors are at play, including that host nations' teams tend to be larger when competing on home soil.  The Beijing 2008 Olympics holds the record for the largest television audience in the history of the Games, drawing in 4.7 billion viewers worldwide. Four years later, London 2012 had a global reach of 3.6 billion viewers, with 90% of the UK population watching at least 15 minutes of coverage. The Rio and Tokyo Games had global audiences of 3.2 billion and 3.05 billion respectively. The decline in TV viewership has been linked to changing viewing habits, with more people turning to social media for highlights of key moments.  Prizes at the Olympics have moved on from the days of a crown of leaves. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in every event at the Olympics, a tradition dating back to the St Louis Games in 1904. The design of the medals varies for each Games, and is the responsibility of the host city’s organising committee. Each of the medals for the Paris 2024 Olympics features 18g of iron taken from the Eiffel Tower during refurbishments. The gold medal is made of gold-plated silver, the silver medal is solid silver, while the bronze medal is solid bronze alloy.    The sunburst pattern around the edge represents shining sporting achievement, as well as a nod to Paris, which is known as the City of Light. Of the three medals, the gold is the heaviest, weighing in at 529g (1.67lb). The back of the Olympic medals features the Greek goddess of victory, Nike, charging forward, with the Acropolis to one side and the Eiffel Tower to the other. The United States The United States has won the most medals at summer Olympic Games, with 2,629 in total, 1,061 of which have been gold.  Russia and Germany (including their precursor National Olympic Committees) are second and third on the list. Great Britain is the fourth most successful nation at the summer Olympics with 916 medals (284 gold). Team GB’s most successful Olympian is Sir Jason Kenny, who won nine medals in track cycling, seven of which were gold. His wife and fellow track cyclist Dame Laura Kenny is Britain’s most successful female Olympian with five gold medals (six medals in total). The Olympic movement aims to build a “peaceful and better world” and promote a spirit of “friendship, solidarity and fair play”, but that does not mean the Olympics has been without its controversies and scandals. The Olympics has been boycotted by nations on numerous occasions. In 1976, 29 countries - mostly from Africa - boycotted the Montreal Games after the IOC allowed New Zealand to compete. Earlier that year, the New Zealand rugby union team had toured South Africa, a country that had been banned from the Olympics since 1964 because of apartheid. The biggest boycott came four years later at the 1980 Games in Moscow, when more than 60 countries - including West Germany - refused to compete. The boycott was initiated by the United States in protest against the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.  Four years later, at Los Angeles 1984, the Soviet Union staged a revenge boycott. The biggest doping scandal to hit the Olympics was Russia’s state-sponsored scheme, which operated for four years from 2011 to 2015 across what investigators found was the ""vast majority"" of summer and winter Olympic sports. In 2019, Russia was handed a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) after Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators. It had to hand over data to Wada as a condition of its controversial reinstatement in 2018 after a three-year suspension for the doping scandal. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) later reduced the ban and ruled that clean Russian athletes could compete at the Olympics and other international events but the team could not use the Russian flag or anthem. Athletes from Russia competed as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) at the 2018 Winter Olympics, and as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) at Tokyo 2020.  Russia has had more than 40 Olympic medals stripped because of doping violations. It remains under sanctions for Paris 2024 because of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and Russians will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) at this year's Games. The IOC is against the politicisation of the Olympics but the effects of politics on the Games have often been felt. In 1936, the Berlin Olympics were used by Adolf Hitler as a showcase for Nazi propaganda, which promoted the superiority of the Aryan race. Ten days before the opening ceremony of the 1968 Games in Mexico City, more than 200 students were killed by the military as they protested against the authoritarian Mexican government. At that same Games, black Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos - who had won gold and bronze respectively in the athletics 200m - each raised a black-gloved fist on the podium during the US national anthem.  Their ‘black power salute’ was a defiant statement against the systemic oppression of black people in the US and marked a defining moment in the history of civil rights activism. Smith and Carlos were later expelled from the Games because of the ban on political statements. Four years later in 1972, the Munich Olympics were overshadowed by what became known as the ‘Munich Massacre’. Demanding the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, eight members of the Palestinian Black September militant group broke into the Olympic Village and killed two members of the Israeli team, taking a further nine hostage.  A botched rescue attempt by German police led to the remaining hostages being killed, as well as five of the militants and one police officer. During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park, directly killing one person and injuring more than 100 others. It was the first of a series of bombings by Eric Rudolph, who later stated his hatred of the federal government and of abortion and gay rights as his motives. At the first modern Olympics in 1896, 241 athletes competed from 14 countries. At Paris 2024, this number is an estimated 10,500 from 206 nations.  These Olympics will be the first Games to achieve full gender parity, with the same number of male and female athletes competing - 5,250 men and 5,250 women. Women were first allowed to compete at the Olympics in 1900, despite De Coubertin being “strongly against” their participation, believing it to be “impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and improper”. Until his death in 1937, he believed the Games were “the solemn and periodic exaltation of male sport - with the applause of women as a reward”. Switzerland’s Helene de Pourtales was the first of 22 women to compete in 1900, and she became the first female Olympic champion when she won sailing gold in that same Games. It was not until 1996 that the promotion of women became a mission of the IOC, while the 2012 Olympics in London was the first Games where all participating nations sent female athletes. Since 2004, the IOC has allowed transgender athletes to compete in the Olympics, though it is understood it was not until the Tokyo Games in 2021 that a transgender athlete took part.  There, Canadian non-binary football player Quinn became the first openly transgender athlete to win a medal as Canada won women's football gold. At the same Games, Alana Smith, a non-binary skateboarder, represented the United States, while transgender athlete Laurel Hubbard of New Zealand competed in the women’s weightlifting.  The IOC's framework on transgender athletes - released in November 2021 - states that there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female sporting events, and places responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport. The world governing bodies of some of the key Olympic sports, including athletics, aquatics and cycling, have banned transgender women competing in the female category at international events. Other sports, including tennis and triathlon, require testosterone levels to be suppressed below a certain limit, while others assess on a case-by-case basis. The IOC's framework also applies to athletes with differences of sex development (DSD). With 28 Olympic medals, 23 of which are gold, Michael Phelps is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time. At Beijing 2008, he won eight gold medals, breaking the previous record of seven first-place finishes at a single Games held by fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz. While Jesse Owens’ medal tally is lower than others on this list, the American arguably had the greatest impact. Despite being encouraged not to, Owens travelled to Berlin to the Games which Adolf Hitler saw as an ideal showcase for Nazi propaganda and a symbol of Aryan racial supremacy. As Hitler watched from the stands, he won 100m gold before becoming the first American track and field star to win four golds at a single Games. Until Phelps surpassed her tally at London 2012, Larisa Latynina held the record for most Olympic medals for 48 years. To this date, she holds the record for the most Olympic medals by a gymnast, and is the only woman to have won nine gold medals. At the age of 14, Nadia Comaneci became the first gymnast to score a perfect score of 10.0 at the Montreal Olympics - a score thought so unlikely the scoreboard had not been programmed to display it. During that Games, she went on to earn a further six 10s as she won three golds at her debut Games. Four years later, not yet out of her teens, she defended her balance beam title - the only gymnast to ever do so - and won floor gold. Usain Bolt is immortalised in Olympic history as the only athlete to have won both the 100m, the Olympics’ blue riband event, and the 200m three times at consecutive Games. Seen as the saviour of athletics during a time of doping scandals, the charismatic Bolt is the world record holder in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay - often after a lunch of chicken nuggets. Before Bolt there was Carl Lewis, who stole the show at his debut Olympics by winning gold in the 100m, 200m, long jump and 4x100m relay. He defended his 100m title in 1988 and went on to win long jump gold on three further occasions. Florence Griffith Joyner - or ‘Flo Jo’ as she became widely known - won triple gold at the Seoul Olympics. Known for her bold fashion choices and nail designs, her 100m (10.49 secs) and 200m (21.34 secs) world records still stand to this day. But her career was tarnished by unsubstantiated allegations that she took banned substances. She died in 1998, aged 38, when she suffocated during a seizure in her sleep. All good things must come to an end, and the Olympics always finishes with huge celebrations. Olympic protocol states the closing ceremony must take place on the final day of the Games, at the Olympic Stadium. There are 12 protocol elements that must be included, such as the parade of athletes, the playing of the Greek national anthem, the lowering of the Olympic flag and flag handover to the next host nation, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame. The Paris 2024 closing ceremony will take place on 11 August at the Stade de France, bringing an end to 17 days of sporting festivities. Los Angeles will host the next Olympics in 2028.

736,Biden sidesteps hard truths in first speech since quitting race,"It was Joe Biden's first chance to define how he will be judged by history. In a rare televised address from the Oval Office on Wednesday night, his first public comments since he abruptly ended his re-election bid on Sunday, he spoke of his accomplishments. He spoke of his humble roots. He sang the praises of the American people. He said the future of American democracy lies in their hands. What he didn’t do, despite saying he would always level with Americans, was provide a direct explanation for the biggest question of the day.  He didn’t say why he has become the first incumbent president to abandon a re-election bid, just a few months before voting begins.  And that is what the history books will be most interested in. He hinted at it. He talked around it. But he never tackled it head on. It was left for the American people to read between the lines. “In recent weeks,” Mr Biden said, “it’s become clear to me that I need to unite my party.” He then echoed what has become a growing chorus among Democrats - that it was time to “pass the torch” to a new generation. While he said his accomplishments, which he listed in detail, merited a second term in office, he added that “nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy – and that includes personal ambition.” Left unsaid was the cold, hard reality that he resigned because it was becoming increasingly clear that he was going to lose to Donald Trump in November. And that is an outcome that those in his party universally view as catastrophic. Trailing in the polls, embarrassed by a miserable debate performance and with a growing chorus in the Democratic Party calling for him to step aside, there was no clear path to a Biden victory. While the president may not have said it, his Republican predecessor - and now former rival for the White House - had no such qualms. At a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, a few hours before the address, Donald Trump said Mr Biden dropped out because he was losing badly.  Then he went on the attack against Kamala Harris, the party’s new presumptive nominee, claiming that she was a “radical left lunatic” and the “ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe”. Republican groups have been flooding the airwaves in key battleground states, in an attempt to define Ms Harris in their terms, not hers. According to research by the Associated Press, Trump’s side is slated to outspend their Democratic counterparts 25-to-1 over the course of the next month. One advertisement had been saying Ms Harris was complicit in covering up the president’s “obvious mental decline”. Mr Biden’s speech offered a nationally televised, primetime opportunity to provide a rebuttal to the attacks against his vice-president and to firmly address concerns about his ability to continue to fulfil his presidential duties. It was an opportunity he mostly passed on. Towards the end of his speech, the president did talk up his running mate. He said Ms Harris was “experienced, tough, capable” and an “incredible partner for me and a leader for our country"". They were strong words, but there weren’t many of them. He spent more time discussing Benjamin Franklin than he did his vice-president – the person he endorsed on Sunday, and the one who will be the most important torch-carrier for his legacy in the months ahead. With little cover from the president, Ms Harris and her team will have to decide whether, and how, to respond to the withering Republican attacks in the coming days. Mr Biden may have another chance to tout his former running mate at the Democratic convention in Chicago next month, but this is a delicate time for the new presumptive nominee, as her campaign is just lifting off the ground and Americans are still getting to know her. The president may have been uncomfortable being overly political in this what could be his final Oval Office address. But if he is concerned about his legacy, Harris’s success or failure, more than anything else he does from here on out, matters.  It will determine whether history judges him as man who made a noble sacrifice, or one who put his party at risk by selfishly holding on to power for too long.",2024-07-25 23:11:23,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg5pq8ql1vo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
741,Aniston criticises JD Vance's 'childless cat ladies' comment,"Jennifer Aniston has criticised Donald Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, for resurfaced comments calling Democrats a ""bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives"". The Friends actress, 55, posted a 2021 interview with Mr Vance that has been widely shared since his selection as Mr Trump's running mate for November's presidential election. ""I truly can’t believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""All I can say is… Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Mr Vance has a two-year-old daughter, and two sons.  ""I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,"" Ms Aniston wrote. ""Because you are trying to take that away from her, too."" The actress has previously spoken openly about her struggles while trying to have children through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Last month, Mr Vance voted to block Democrat-proposed legislation to guarantee access to IVF nationwide. Ahead of that vote, Mr Vance and the other 48 Senate Republicans signed a letter saying they supported IVF, but that the Democratic bill was overly broad and ""false fearmongering"". In the clip, Mr Vance criticised Vice-President Kamala Harris because she has no biological children. Ms Harris is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children. But Mr Vance told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson the US was run by ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too"". ""Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,"" he said. ""How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?"" Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, posted a reaction to Mr Vance's comments on Instagram on Thursday. “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I?” the 25-year-old daughter of Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and his ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, wrote. Cole Emhoff is her 29-year-old brother. The BBC has contacted the Trump-Vance campaign team for comment. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also addressed the comments earlier this week, speaking about adopting twins with his husband, Chasten. ""The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,"" Mr Buttigieg told CNN’s The Source programme. ""He couldn’t have known that - but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children."" There has also been backlash from fans of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who has no children - and three cats. ""It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is Taylor Swift,"" British writer Caitlin Moran posted on X. Another X user shared the Time magazine cover where Swift posed with one of her cats, writing: ""Hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate."" In 2022, Aniston told Allure she wished someone had told her to freeze her eggs. ""It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,"" she said. ""All the years and years of speculation... it was really hard.  ""I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it."" But she had ""zero regrets"". ""I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today,"" she told the magazine. ""The ship has sailed.""",2024-07-25 23:11:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3pz2pz8no,Unknown,Unknown,,True
745,Ferocious France beat Argentina in Olympics grudge match,"This video can not be played Highlights: Argentina 14-26 France France turned on the style to overwhelm Argentina - their recent antagonists - as the hosts reached the semi-finals of Olympics men's sevens in front of an euphoric Parisian crowd. London-born wing Aaron Grandidier scored two scintillating tries in a 26-14 victory for Les Bleus and led the jubilant celebrations at full-time with 70,000 supporters in the Stade de France. French fans have been upset by the behaviour of Argentina's footballers towards their nation. Bad blood between the two countries' football teams has developed - with Argentina deemed to have celebrated their 2022 World Cup win too exuberantly and players recently filmed chanting what is a deemed a racist song against their French counterparts. It led to Los Pumas being angrily booed when they ran out into the Stade de France before each of their matches at the Olympic event. The atmosphere was ferocious in the early stages of Thursday's quarter-final - and the intensity of the French players matched it. ""I know we've only just won a quarter-final but the emotions we're living in this stadium we have never experienced,"" Grandidier told BBC Sport. ""It is really moving. Having 69,000 people for a game of sevens has never been seen in history."" Fiji come back to beat Ireland in Olympic quarter-final  Dupont inspires France as party starts in Paris Aaron Grandidier plays for Pau in the French Top 14 league After a series of underwhelming performances in the pool stage, where they finished second behind Fiji, this was a statement performance from France. Back-rower Andy Timo scored the opening try after two minutes before 24-year-old Grandidier, who has an English father and a French mother, twice stormed in down the right. Rayan Rebbadj added the conversions as France led 21-0 at half-time, even with talisman Antoine Dupont starting on the bench. ""We knew we had to start strong against a team like Argentina, they have been so good this season,"" said Grandidier. ""If we didn't put in a XXL performance against them we knew we would be in trouble."" Argentina narrowed the deficit to 21-14 through tries from Rodrigo Isgro and Marcos Moneta after the break, with Joaquin Pellandini kicking the extras. Dupont, the irrepressible 15s superstar who is one of the poster boys of the Games, came on to add some nous as France played patiently to slow down their opponent's momentum. Of course, Dupont also had to sprinkle some magic too. The scrum-half ran in a late try to seal victory and end Argentina's hopes of what would have been seen as a villainous comeback. Grandidier was at the centre of the celebrations after the final whistle, high-fiving the gleeful supporters on the front row behind the dugout. ""We need to play without pressure which maybe let us down the first couple of games but we set the record straight,"" he said. This video can not be played Tries of the day France will play South Africa, who stunned New Zealand in a 14-7 win, in Saturday's semi-finals. Ireland's hopes of a medal are over. They could not end the unbeaten Olympic run of reigning two-time gold medallist Fiji, going down 19-15 in heartbreaking fashion. Ireland led 15-12 midway through the second half, but the Fijians fought back with two tries to set up a semi-final against Australia. The Wallabies cruised to a 18-0 victory over the United States in the last of Thursday's quarter-finals.

746,All eyes on the opening ceremony - Friday's Olympics action,"The live sport has started at the Paris Olympics so what better way to plan ahead than with our day-by-day guide - all times BST.  Team GB has named a squad of 327 athletes and UK Sport has set a target of 50 to 70 medals at the Games.  There will be live coverage of Paris 2024 across the BBC on TV, radio and online.  The Games will be officially opened at a unique and spectacular opening ceremony along the River Seine on Friday, 26 July and will close on Sunday, 11 August. Full Paris 2024 schedule All you need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympics Highlights Opening ceremony - 18:30, with BBC TV coverage beginning at 17:45.  Around 300,000 people will watch from the banks of the River Seine as a parade of some 10,000 athletes takes place not in a stadium, but on boats for each team. The ceremony finale will take place at the Trocadero. No Olympic Games has held an opening ceremony like this before, so expect something completely different.  The plan comes with logistical and security complications that have challenged organisers, who chose earlier this year to limit the number of spectators at the water’s edge.  There is no sport scheduled at the Games on Friday, clearing the path for the ceremony to be the centre of attention. Brit watch None in action. World watch None in action. Expert knowledge  More than 90 boats will be in use for the opening ceremony, carrying not only the athletes but also a range of performers that you will see throughout the evening. Theatre director Thomas Jolly, who is the show’s artistic director, has pointed out there is no way to fully rehearse the show on the river. Instead, parts of the ceremony have been practised inside giant hangars and the boat captains are reported to have been rehearsing at a sailing centre. How to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBC Gold medal events: Diving (women's synchro 3m springboard), fencing (women's epee, men's sabre), judo (women's -48kg, men's -60kg), road cycling (men's and women's individual time trial), rugby sevens (men's), shooting (mixed team 10m air rifle), skateboard (men's street), swimming (men's 400m free, women's 400m free, women's 4x100m free relay, men's 4x100m free relay). Highlights Road cycling’s time trial is a chance for Josh Tarling to get Team GB’s Olympics off to a flying start. The 20-year-old won the European title last year and is considered a contender in the men’s event, which for the first time at an Olympics uses the same course as the women’s, taking in sections of forest alongside Paris monuments like the Louvre and Eiffel Tower. The women’s time trial featuring GB’s Anna Henderson, a European silver medallist, starts at 13:30 with the men’s event at 15:34. In the swimming, Saturday night brings a hotly anticipated three or even four-way contest in the women’s 400m freestyle (19:55). US legend Katie Ledecky lost to Australia’s Ariarne Titmus in 2021 and Titmus won last year’s world title, too, while Canadian 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is the world record-holder. New Zealand’s Erika Fairweather is also expected to do well. The Brits have a shot at a medal in the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay (20:37). Adam Peaty will be competing in the 100m breaststroke heats (10:00). GB divers Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen go in the women’s 3m synchro from 10:00. They won world silver in 2023 behind China. Men’s rugby sevens is already on its final day. France will be hoping Antoine Dupont, who skipped the Six Nations to prepare for this, can lead the hosts to a famous title at the Stade de France. The final is at 18:45. Brit watch At the Palace of Versailles, Team GB begin their defence of the Olympic team eventing crown. Saturday is the dressage stage of eventing (from 08:30), which is followed by cross-country and finally showjumping. Tokyo champions Tom McEwen and Laura Collett are back in the line-up this time around, joined by European champion Ros Canter. The first hockey match of Paris 2024 features Team GB’s men versus Spain (09:00). Spain are ranked eighth in the world. Team GB’s squad is predominantly English, and England are currently the world’s number two nation behind the Netherlands in men’s hockey. Ireland’s men face Belgium at 09:30. Gymnastics begins with men’s qualifying. Team GB are in subdivision one of three, starting at 10:00. Qualifying is what decides who makes the team final, all-around final and individual finals later in the Games. Max Whitlock, now 31, has a stated aim of becoming the first gymnast to win a medal on the same apparatus (in his case, the pommel horse) in four successive Olympics. This video can not be played Paris 2024: Max Whitlock's amazing Olympic career through art World watch From 16:00, skateboarding’s men’s street final could be dominated by Japan. Yuto Horigome is back after winning gold on home soil three years ago, and he is joined by 2023 world champion Sora Shirai. French hopes rest with world number nine and 2022 world champion Aurelien Giraud. For the US, legend of the sport Nyjah Huston is hoping to make up for missing out on a medal in Tokyo. In judo (medal contests from 16:18), Georgia’s Giorgi Sardalashvili produced a stunning result in May to become world champion in the men’s -60kg division aged just 20. France’s Luka Mkheidze, the Tokyo bronze medallist, will be going up against him, as will Spanish 2023 world champion Francisco Garrigos. Roland-Garros, the home of the French Open, hosts this year’s Olympic tennis. It is possible that this could be the last major event for Spain’s Rafael Nadal, an Olympic singles and doubles champion, who enters both events this time and teams up with Carlos Alcaraz in the doubles. Novak Djokovic has also said he is prioritising the Olympics – one of the few tennis titles the Serb has never won. Expert knowledge If you have just hopped across the Channel to Paris hoping to catch some of the Olympic surfing, bad news: it is in Tahiti, which is 10,000 miles away. This breaks the record for the furthest an event has ever taken place from the host city of an Olympics. Tahiti’s Teahupo’o wave is considered world-class and Tahiti is part of French Polynesia, a semi-autonomous territory of France. The men’s and women’s first rounds take place on Saturday. The first gold medal of Paris 2024 is likely to be shooting’s mixed team air rifle. The gold-medal round begins at 10:00. Michael Bargeron and Seonaid McIntosh are the British entrants. Gold medal events: Archery (women's team), canoe slalom (women's K1), fencing (men's epee, women's foil), judo (W -52kg, M -66kg), mountain bike (women's cross-country), shooting (men and women's 10m air pistol), skateboard (women's street), swimming (men's 400m individual medley, women's 100m fly, men's 100m breast). Highlights Team GB’s Adam Peaty is expected to challenge for a third consecutive men’s 100m breaststroke Olympic title in Sunday’s final at 20:54. This time, he has described himself as “the person with the bow and arrow and not the one being fired at” after a foot injury and time away from the sport to focus on his mental health. He was third at the world championships in February. Watch for China’s Qin Haiyang and American Nic Fink in the same event. Meanwhile, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand should line up in the final of the men’s 400m individual medley at 19:30. Marchand is one of the biggest names on the hosts' Olympic team and is expected to end a 12-year French gold-medal drought in the pool. When he was younger, Marchand wrote to American great Michael Phelps’ former coach, Bob Bowman, to ask if Bowman would be his coach. Bowman said yes and Marchand now has five world titles at the age of 22. Team GB's Evie Richards, the 2021 world champion, features in the women’s cross-country mountain bike event from 13:10. Richards is coming back from a concussion suffered in Brazil two months ago, so does not start the race as a favourite, but is still ranked inside the world’s top 15. Switzerland’s Alessandra Keller is the world number one. Watch out for young Dutch star Puck Pieterse and France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prevot. Chelsie Giles is the headline act in GB’s judo squad for Paris 2024. The 27-year-old won bronze in Tokyo then added European gold and world silver a year later. Giles is in the -52kg class, which is packed with talent like Japan’s Uta Abe, who has proved a hard obstacle for Giles to overcome in the past and has been sweeping up medals lately. GB have won 20 Olympic medals in judo but never a gold, meaning there is history on the line. Women’s medal contests begin at 16:49. It is impossible to look past South Korea in most archery events. This includes the women’s team event, which they have won every time since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1988. Not only were none of the current GB team born then, but their coach was four years old. However, this GB team are made of strong stuff. Penny Healey and Bryony Pitman have each been ranked world number one in the past year, so this could be a real opportunity for them to shine. The event begins at 08:30 with the gold-medal match at 16:11. Brit watch Helen Glover, an Olympic rowing champion in 2012 and 2016, is back for her fourth Olympics. This time she is in the women’s four alongside returning Olympian Rebecca Shorten and debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave (no relation to Sir Steve). They only got together at the start of the year but were unbeaten at a string of major events in the first half of 2024. Sunday’s rowing begins at 08:00, with the women’s four heats from 11:30. At the women’s rugby sevens, Team GB face Ireland in the opening group game at 14:30. GB have finished fourth at the past two Olympics, whereas this is the Irish women’s Olympic debut. Ireland go on to play South Africa at 18:00, while GB play Australia at 18:30. Kimberley Woods will line up for GB in canoe slalom’s K1 event (starts 14:30, final at 16:45). Woods had a “heartbreaking” Tokyo Games, finishing 10th, but believes she has grown mentally and physically in the years since. She is a contender in both this event and the kayak cross, which is making its Olympic debut later in the Games. Eventing heads into its second day, the cross-country, from 09:30. This involves a gallop of nine to 10 minutes through the park at Versailles, twice crossing the centuries-old Grand Canal in what might be one of the Paris Olympics’ signature views. In women’s hockey, Team GB begin their campaign against Spain at 12:15. GB beat Spain in a quarter-final shootout in Tokyo before going on to win bronze. Later on Sunday, at 19:15, the GB men play their second group game against South Africa. World watch In gymnastics, it is the women’s turn to head through qualifying. Britain are again in the first subdivision at 08:30. The United States and China are in subdivision two from 10:40. Team GB’s women took team bronze in Tokyo three years ago. The US, who are the defending world champions, are led once again by Simone Biles – now competing in her third Olympic Games aged 27, with a coincidental total of 27 world and Olympic titles already won. Men’s water polo begins on Sunday and is part one of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. Water polo is often described as the national sport of Hungary, who won 2023’s world title and have nine Olympic gold medals in this event, although none since 2008. What better way to start than against the hosts? France have a tradition of winning the Olympic men’s water polo title whenever it’s held in Paris – which unfortunately for them has only happened once, a century ago. France play Hungary at 18:30. Expert knowledge In women’s street skateboarding, where teenagers are often contenders, France will be represented by 14-year-old Lucie Schoonheere. Nobody in the top 10 of this event’s world rankings heading into the Olympics is aged older than 19. Japan’s Coco Yoshizawa, also 14, is the world number one. The final begins at 16:00. No sport has provided France with more Olympic medals than fencing – 123 of them at the start of Paris 2024, 30 more than cycling in second place. This brings us to part two of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. If the Hungarians are the strong favourites against France in water polo, the men’s epee might give France more of a chance. Hungary’s Gergely Siklosi and Mate Koch are the world number one and two respectively, but when Siklosi lost the Olympic final in 2021, who beat him? France’s Romain Cannone. Cannone and veteran team-mate Yannick Borel are both in the world top five and on the team for Paris 2024. Japan and Italy will also be hoping to have a say. Expect the medal events in men’s epee and women’s foil from around 19:50. The young stars to follow at Paris 2024 This video can not be played Paris 2024: Adam Peaty watches emotional messages from family & friends Gold medal events: Archery (men's team), artistic gymnastics (men's team), canoe slalom (men's C1), diving (men's synchro 10m platform), equestrian (eventing jumping team, eventing jumping individual), fencing (men foil, women sabre), judo (W -57kg, M -73kg), mountain bike (men's cross-country), shooting (men's and women's 10m air rifle), swimming (women's 400m individual medley, men's 200m free, men's 100m back, women's 100m breaststroke, women's 200m free). Highlights  Tom Daley, now 30, is back for his fifth Olympic Games representing Team GB. He is paired with 24-year-old Noah Williams in the men’s 10m synchro, an event in which Daley won a dramatic Tokyo gold alongside Matty Lee. Daley and Williams are top-ranked coming into Paris 2024 but the rankings do not fully account for the threat from China, whose pairing of Lian Junjie and Hao Yang have won the past three world titles. The final starts at 10:00. In swimming, GB’s line-up for the men’s 200m freestyle is so strong that Tom Dean, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo, does not make the start list. Instead, Team GB will look to 2023 world champion Matt Richards and Tokyo silver medallist Duncan Scott. Watch out for Romania’s David Popovici, who is a second faster than anyone else this year heading into the event (final starts 19:43). Tom Pidcock is in the middle of an exhausting 2024. He arrives at the Paris Olympics immediately after Covid forced him out of the Tour de France, and then he will compete not just in road cycling but also in mountain biking’s cross-country event, which starts at 13:10. Pidcock’s electric performance to win this event three years ago was a British highlight in Tokyo, and he says defending that title is his priority. In the men’s team gymnastics final (from 16:30), GB have a shot at the podium. China and Japan have looked a class apart in recent years, but the Brits were third at the 2022 world championships and narrowly beaten into fourth by the US a year later. Max Whitlock was in the team that won bronze at London 2012 and has since had to endure back-to-back fourth-place Olympic finishes in this event. Eventing reaches its last day of action, concluding with showjumping from 10:00. Will GB be able to take back-to-back titles? The British are fielding an extraordinarily strong team but jumping is one of those sports where a first tiny error can rapidly become a catastrophe. Anything could happen, no matter how the dressage and cross-country set things up. Brit watch  Adam Burgess was 0.16 seconds away from a medal in canoe slalom’s C1 event at the Tokyo Games. Burgess has embarked on what he calls “project send it” ahead of Paris – learning to “send it a little bit more in the final” to make sure he can truly compete for medals on the Olympic stage. Also sending it from 14:30 will be Benjamin Savsek, the Slovenian who won gold in Tokyo and remains one of the top-ranked in the world. Seonaid McIntosh, from a shooting family, took European silver in the 10m air rifle last year and is inside the top 20 worldwide. The final starts at 08:30. Michael Bargeron competes in the men’s event from 11:00. In hockey, Ireland’s men play Australia at 09:00 before GB’s women play Australia at 16:00. In rugby sevens, GB’s women play South Africa at 13:00. Ireland play Australia at 13:30. World watch  Back at the swimming, the women’s 100m breaststroke (20:32) could become a battle royale. Team USA’s Lilly King is back in the mix after winning gold in 2016, as is Tokyo silver medallist Tatjana Smith, while Lithuania’s Ruta Meilutyte could also feature. China’s Tang Qianting is the world champion and this year’s standout performer. Olha Kharlan is one of Ukraine’s biggest Olympic names, a four-time world champion in women’s sabre and a four-time Olympic fencing medallist. Kharlan qualified for Paris 2024 in unusual circumstances. She did not shake the hand of Russia’s Anna Smirnova at last year's World Championships, Smirnova protested, and Kharlan was disqualified. The International Olympic Committee stepped in to guarantee Kharlan a place at the Games. The women’s sabre final, which Kharlan will hope to reach, takes place from 20:45. Expert knowledge South Korea are again the dominant force in men’s team archery (medal matches from 15:48), but there is just a chance that Turkey disrupt that this year. Led by Tokyo individual champion Mete Gazoz, Turkey ranked a lowly seventh after the qualifying round at last year’s World Championships but picked off the Netherlands and Japan in back-to-back come-from-behind victories to set up a final with South Korea. They lost, but Turkey coach Goktug Ergin has already proclaimed his team ready to fight for medals. It is the country’s first Olympic appearance in this event for 24 years. This video can not be played Paris Olympics 2024: Team GB swimming team-mates take on painting challenge Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's team final), fencing (women's epee team), judo (women's -63kg, men's -81 kg), rugby sevens (women's), shooting (mixed team 10m air pistol, men's trap), surfing (men's and women's), swimming (women's 100m back, men's 800m free, men's 4x200m free relay), table tennis (mixed doubles), triathlon (men's individual). Highlights Top coaches have described the Paris triathlon course as “insane”. It is, at least, in-Seine. You start from the Pont Alexandre III bridge in view of the Eiffel Tower, swim 1,500m in the Seine – two downstream sections and one upstream – then run up a set of posh steps to start the 40km bike course, which introduced some cobbled stretches into the mix. Lastly, there is a 10km run back along the same course. It promises to be a spectacular and challenging event, even by Olympic triathlon standards, and GB’s Alex Yee will hope to be at the front of the action in the men's event. Yee won Olympic silver in a pulsating Tokyo contest three years ago. Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, who pulled past Yee to win gold that day, is back but has since moved up to Ironman distance then back down again, and it remains to be seen if he will master that transition. The race starts at 07:00. Women’s team gymnastics is one of the Olympics’ worldwide blockbuster events. The United States will expect one of its largest TV audiences of the Games for Simone Biles and compatriots, assuming they qualify for Tuesday’s final, which begins at 17:15. Becky Downie, back in the British team for a third Olympics, is tasked with helping to steer GB towards a podium finish. The women’s team event is intensely competitive right now, and any of six or seven nations could take a medal, with the absence of Russian athletes also opening up the contest. There is lots going on in swimming's evening session. Team GB have a real chance of gold in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay, having won the Olympic title in Tokyo and the world title in 2023. Tom Dean, James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott are all veterans of both victories and are in the line-up. The relay starts at 20:59. The women’s 100m backstroke at 19:57 is expected to feature Australia’s Kaylee McKeown, a three-time champion in Tokyo, against the likes of American Regan Smith and Canada’s Kylie Masse. Brit watch It is day one of dressage. Yes, you did just see dressage a few days ago. That was eventing dressage. This is dressage dressage, where GB have an extremely accomplished team. The event begins at 10:00. Freestyle BMX begins with qualifiers featuring GB’s Kieran Reilly and Charlotte Worthington (12:25 onward). Reilly is the men’s world champion and Worthington is the Olympic champion. In the men’s event, France’s Anthony Jeanjean is an imposing threat to Reilly, particularly having demonstrated he can entertain a home crowd with a World Cup win in Montpellier leading up the Games. Australia’s Logan Martin is defending his Tokyo title. Joe Clarke, who won canoe slalom gold in Rio eight years ago but was left out of the GB team for Tokyo in 2021, is back for Paris and begins his K1 event with the heats from 15:00. Mallory Franklin, the women’s C1 Tokyo silver medallist and world champion, starts her heats at 14:00. GB men's hockey team play the Netherlands, the only team with a better world ranking, in their group at 11:45. Ireland play India at 12:15. Tokyo bronze medallist Matthew Coward-Holley and 2022 world silver medallist Nathan Hales will hope to be in the men’s trap shooting final from 14:30. Coward-Holley comes into the Games ranked third in the world behind Spain’s Alberto Fernandez and Australia’s James Willett. World watch A win on home turf would give France’s Tokyo opening ceremony flagbearer, Clarisse Agbegnenou, a third Olympic judo gold alongside the -63kg and mixed team titles she won three years ago. Lucy Renshall is GB’s representative in the event. Medal contests from 16:49. 3x3 basketball is making its second Olympic appearance after a debut in Tokyo, offering a street version of the game using half a court. Latvia won the first 3x3 Olympic men’s title three years ago and begin their defence against Lithuania (17:35), who proved a surprise package at the 2022 World Championships, getting all the way to the final with victories against teams including France and the US. Surfing presents a dilemma for writers of day-by-day guides: if it starts on Tuesday and goes through the night into Wednesday, where to put it? In case you want to follow the whole thing: the quarter-finals begin at 18:00 on Tuesday, the semi-finals will go past midnight, the men’s gold-medal contest will be at 02:34 on Wednesday and the women’s final will be at 03:15. Remember, this is because the surfing is in Tahiti, which is 12 hours behind France. The US will expect to win the women’s surfing title with the likes of Olympic champion Carissa Moore and world champion Caroline Marks on the team, but watch out for Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb, Costa Rica’s Brisa Hennessy and France’s Vahine Fierro, who used to live in Tahiti and trains there. On the men’s side, Brazil’s Gabriel Medina and US surfer John John Florence are two out of a dozen or more names in with a serious chance of winning. Tahitian Kauli Vaast, surfing for France, is an underdog who could exploit his local knowledge. Women’s rugby sevens reaches the final at 18:45. Will GB improve on fourth place in Tokyo? Can France go one better than last time and clinch gold on home soil? Will New Zealand be all-conquering again, or can Australia get back to their winning ways of 2016? Expert knowledge The Dominican Republic's men's football team, whose squad includes Leeds defender Junior Firpo, are playing fellow Olympic debutants Uzbekistan (14:00). This might be both teams' best shot at a result if tough encounters against Egypt and Spain do not go their way. Something jaw-dropping happened at Tokyo 2020: China failed to win one of the table tennis gold medals. To put this in perspective, China have won 32 of the 37 Olympic table tennis titles ever contested, and the one they missed in Tokyo was the first the country had not won since 2004. To rub salt into that wound, it was a new event, the mixed doubles, where Japan’s Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito pulled off a come-from-behind win over Chinese rivals for gold on home soil. Could China possibly be denied again? Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha are the world number one-ranked duo coming into the Paris 2024 mixed doubles, which concludes with the final at 13:30. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (men's individual all-around), BMX freestyle (men's and women's), canoe slalom (women's C1), diving (women's synchro 10m platform), fencing (men's sabre team), judo (women's-70kg, men's -90kg), rowing (men's quadruple sculls, women's quadruple sculls), shooting (women's trap), swimming (women's 100m free, men's 200m fly, women's 1500m free, men's 200m breast, men's 100m free), triathlon (women's individual). Highlights Wednesday is the women’s turn to take on the Paris triathlon course from 07:00. Team GB have a very strong team in world champion Beth Potter, Tokyo individual silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown and world top 10-ranked Kate Waugh. France’s Cassandre Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi are also contenders for gold at their home Games. The men's all-around gymnastics final begins at 16:30, an event where athletes compete on all six apparatus to decide the best overall gymnast at the Olympics. Max Whitlock made it on to the Rio podium in this event eight years ago, but defending champion and multiple world title-winner Daiki Hashimoto is the favourite. We reach the freestyle BMX finals from 12:10, where GB’s Charlotte Worthington and Kieran Reilly are proven champions on the world stage. This is freestyle’s second Olympic appearance. To win gold, perform as many tricks as you can in 60 seconds and make sure they are better than anyone else’s. Depending on how Tuesday’s heats went, Wednesday could bring a medal opportunity for GB’s Mallory Franklin in the C1 women’s canoe slalom (final from 16:25). Australia’s Jessica Fox, one of the greatest canoeists of all time and the Tokyo champion, will be one of Franklin’s biggest rivals. Watch out for Elena Lilik, who beat Andrea Herzog – Tokyo’s bronze medallist – to claim Germany’s sole entry in this event. Brit watch Rowing’s quadruple sculls finals begin at 11:26. Britain are the world champions in the women’s event and picked up 2022 world silver in the men’s race. In shooting, Lucy Hall, a European silver medallist in 2022, will hope to feature in the women’s trap final at 14:30. Jemima Yeats-Brown lost her sister and biggest fan, Jenny, to brain cancer just after winning Commonwealth judo bronze in 2022. Yeats-Brown says that has helped inspire a “life’s too short” approach to competing that helped her secure fifth at the World Championships in 2023. She fights in the -70kg category, where medal contests start at 16:18. In hockey, GB’s women play South Africa at 09:30. World watch The 100m freestyle contest at the pool (21:15) is a chance to see Caeleb Dressel, regarded as one of the greatest sprinters in US and world swimming, defending his Tokyo title. There is a lot of hype coming into Paris about David Popovici, a superstar of the Romanian team, but he had a tough 2023. This is a chance for Popovici to make an impact after finishing seventh in Tokyo aged just 16, while Matt Richards and Duncan Scott swim for GB. Also watch for Anna Hopkin in the women’s 100m freestyle (19:30), James Wilby in the men’s 200m breaststroke (21:08) and American Katie Ledecky in the women’s 1,500m free (20:04). In men’s basketball the US-South Sudan game (20:00) pits one of the most dominant teams in Olympic history against a first-time entrant. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011 and its basketball federation joined world governing body Fiba in 2013, so getting to the Olympics about a decade later is pretty good going, to put it mildly. At the heart of that story? Luol Deng, who played basketball for GB at London 2012. Deng, who spent a decade playing for the NBA’s Chicago Bulls, holds British and South Sudanese citizenship. For years as a coach, he has been a driving force (and financial force) behind the South Sudan team’s rise to Olympic status. Facing the US in Paris may be the pinnacle of that incredible story arc. Expert knowledge  Lois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix come into Paris 2024 as history-makers before they even start their first dive. The duo won world silver last year, the first time Britain had won any women’s diving medal at that level. If they win another medal here – the women’s 10m synchro diving final starts at 10:00 – watch for some cartwheels on the BBC studio sofa, as Andrea’s dad is Fred Sirieix, star of First Dates turned BBC presenter at Paris 2024. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's individual all-around), athletics (men's and women's 20km race walk), canoe slalom (men K1), fencing (women's foil team), judo (women's -78kg, men's -100kg), rowing (women's double sculls, men's double sculls, women's coxless four, men's coxless four), sailing (men's and women's skiff), shooting (men's 50m rifle 3 positions) and swimming (women's 200m fly, men's 200m back, women's 200m breast, women's 4x200m free relay). Highlights British rowers are used to heaps of gold medals – more than 30 of them in Olympic rowing. GB were the top rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Then came Tokyo and not one gold. They were 14th in the rowing medal table, which was a shock. Thursday might be the day we know if the Brits are turning that ship around. Helen Glover will hope to lead an impressive women’s four in the final at 10:50, while the men’s four won the world title in both 2022 and 2023. Their final is at 11:10. The space of about half an hour could play a huge role in deciding if this Olympic regatta is a GB return to form. The rowers are not the only ones who had a Tokyo to forget. Joe Clarke did not make the team despite being the defending Olympic champion in K1 slalom canoeing. Now, he is back and will hope to be a big factor in the Paris final from 16:30. The women’s all-around gymnastics final at 17:15 could see some remarkable history being made. If they are both healthy and nominated for this event, American duo Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee could make this the first women’s all-around final in which the past two Olympic champions have competed. Biles won in 2016, followed by Lee in 2020. If either of them wins gold, they will be the first woman to win multiple Olympic all-around titles since Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968. Brit watch Golf found its way back on to the Olympic schedule in 2016 after more than a century in the wilderness (or perhaps deep rough). At Paris 2024, the course is L’Albatros at Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2018. The first round of the men’s event starts at 08:00 and features GB’s Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood, Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and a host of the sport’s other big names. Luke Greenbank will hope to better his Tokyo bronze medal in the men’s 200m backstroke (19:37) at the pool. Meanwhile, Team GB have been top-four material of late in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay so could pose a medal threat there too (20:48). Beth Shriever has remained dominant in BMX racing since winning Olympic gold in Tokyo. However, she fractured her collarbone at the sport’s World Championships in May, meaning one of GB’s big medal hopes has faced a race against time. From 19:20 we will see how that comeback has progressed as the early stages of her event take place. In the men’s event, Olympic and world silver medallist Kye Whyte is returning from a back injury of his own. In hockey, GB’s men take on hosts France at 11:45, Ireland’s men play Argentina at 12:15 and GB’s women face the US at 16:00. Showjumping begins with the team qualifier from 10:00. Scott Brash and Ben Maher, who were part of Britain’s gold medal-winning team at London 2012, are joined this time around by Harry Charles. World watch Back at the pool, Katie Ledecky may have a shot at some Olympic history by this point in the Games. If she has won two medals by this point – very possible, given the 200m free and 400m free will have been and gone, and she has won golds in both in the past – then a medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay (20:48) would be her 13th overall, a record for a US female Olympian. (Three American women, all of them swimmers, have previously reached 12: Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin.) The men’s and women’s 20km race walks begin at 06:30 and 08:20 respectively. Chinese veteran Liu Hong, the 2016 women’s champion, is trying to end a run of five years – ages, by her standards – without a major title. Spain’s Maria Perez is the world champion, having been on the brink of quitting the sport in 2022 after back-to-back disqualifications at that year’s European and world championships. Another Spanish athlete, Alvaro Martin, is the men’s world champion. At Roland Garros, we reach the first tennis semi-finals from 11:00. Expert knowledge The first sailing medals of the Games will be awarded in the skiff class. For the men, this means the 49er, and for the women it is the 49er FX (a version designed to work with a lighter two-person crew than the 49er). Saskia Tidey is at her third Olympics and representing her second country in sailing.  Tidey sailed for Ireland in 2016, then switched to GB for Tokyo once it became apparent that she had no suitable Irish partner available in the two-person event. Tidey and GB team-mate Charlotte Dobson finished sixth three years ago, and now Tidey is back with new partner Freya Black. The two were European bronze medallists in May. GB’s James Peters and Fynn Sterritt, in the men’s event, said before the Games they had been trying to put on weight after realising they were one of the lighter boats in the men’s fleet. Britain are the defending champions in this event after Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell won gold three years ago.  Gold medal events: Archery (mixed team), athletics (men's 10,000m), badminton (mixed doubles), BMX racing (men's and women's), diving (men's synchro 3m springboard), equestrian (jumping team), fencing (men's epee team), judo (women's +78kg, men's +100kg), rowing (men's coxless pair, women's coxless pair, men's lightweight double sculls, women's lightweight double sculls), sailing (men's and women's windsurfing), shooting (women's 50m rifle 3 positions), swimming (men's 50m free, women's 200m back, men's 200m individual medley), tennis (mixed doubles), trampoline gymnastics (women's and men's). Highlights Keely Hodgkinson, tipped to be one of Team GB’s biggest stars in Paris, appears for the first time in the 800m heats from 18:45. The 22-year-old is hoping to upgrade Tokyo silver to gold in 2024. Earlier, Dina Asher-Smith will be in the opening stages of the women’s 100m from 10:50. She, like Hodgkinson, won the European title in her event last month. Jack Laugher will dive with his third different partner in as many Olympics when he competes in the men’s 3m synchro diving from 10:00. Anthony Harding is Laugher’s team-mate this time. They have won two world silver medals together, each time behind China. Laugher won this event with Chris Mears at Rio 2016. It is BMX racing finals day. If Beth Shriever and Kye Whyte have recovered from pre-Games injuries and are still in the running, they will have to negotiate the semi-finals before the gold-medal races from 20:35. Both riders are in the world’s top six. France have a trio of highly rated riders on the men’s side, while Australia’s Saya Sakakibara is seeking redemption in the women’s event after a semi-final crash in Tokyo. Bryony Page stunned the field when she took the first Olympic trampoline medal in Britain’s history, silver in 2016. She added bronze in Tokyo and has won two of the past three world titles, setting up one another bid for gold aged 33 before she pursues her dream of joining the acrobats at Cirque du Soleil. Qualifying is at 11:00 before the final at 12:50. Lightweight scullers Emily Craig and Imogen Grant missed a medal in the women’s lightweight double sculls by 0.01 seconds in Tokyo. Since then, they have won back-to-back world titles and are considered one of the British rowing team’s best hopes for gold in Paris. The final takes place at 11:22. In sailing, windsurfing reaches its final day. This year’s windsurfing event involves a new class, iQFoil, which replaces the old RS:X class. The way the IOC explains the difference is that “instead of floating, the board appears to fly” in the iQFoil class because of hydrofoils that lift the board out of the water at certain speeds. Emma Wilson, who won RS:X bronze in Tokyo, has world silver and bronze medals in iQFoil and will hope to be going for a podium place on Friday. Brit watch Swimming on Friday features GB’s Ben Proud versus American Caeleb Dressel in the men’s 50m freestyle (final at 19:30). Dressel is the Tokyo Olympic champion, while Proud has a gold and two bronzes from the past three World Championships. Australia’s Cameron McEvoy will also be hoping for a medal. In shooting, world number one Seonaid McIntosh takes aim in the women’s 50m rifle three positions from 08:30. The “three positions” part means you shoot kneeling, prone (lying down) and standing. Friday’s equestrian highlight is the team jumping final at 13:00, featuring a British team who took world bronze behind Sweden and the Netherlands in 2022. In hockey, Ireland’s men play New Zealand at 16:00, followed by GB against Germany at 19:15. World watch Returning to the pool, the men’s 200m individual medley (19:49) offers an opportunity for French swimming star Leon Marchand to try to surpass Ryan Lochte’s world record time. Lochte’s record is one minute 54.00 seconds, while Marchand got down to 1:54.82 in winning world gold ahead of GB’s Duncan Scott and Tom Dean last year. Tokyo silver medallist Scott and Dean will hope to make the Paris final, while Tokyo champion Wang Shun of China is back. In the men's 50m freestyle, France will be cheering for Florent Manaudou, London 2012 gold medallist in the event and one of the hosts’ two flagbearers at the opening ceremony. Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei has dominated the men’s 10,000m but was beaten by Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega in an extraordinarily humid Tokyo 2020 final. Both are back for 2024 and this is the only title on offer during the opening night of athletics (20:20). Badminton’s mixed doubles final (15:10) is highly likely to have at least one Chinese entry and it would be no surprise if, like Tokyo, the final was between two Chinese teams. Three years ago, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong were defeated by Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping. Gold medallist Wang has since retired, so silver medallists Zheng and Huang Yaqiong may end up facing Huang Dongping and new partner Feng Yanzhe this time around. Archery’s mixed team final takes place from 15:43. In Tokyo, an arrow from South Korea’s An San hit and split an arrow shot by team-mate Kim Je-deok on their way to gold in this event. This is almost impossible to achieve and is known as a “Robin Hood arrow”. According to World Archery, this may have been the first time a Robin Hood arrow was ever filmed in competition. The two arrows are now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Tennis reaches the mixed doubles final and men’s singles semi-finals (11:00-20:00). The men’s football quarter-finals take place in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux with kick-offs between 14:00 and 20:00. In women’s 3x3 basketball, two of the world’s top-ranked nations – France and the US – meet at 12:00. Expert knowledge Teddy Riner will try to equal the Olympic judo record for three individual gold medals in front of his home crowd. The 100+kg event’s medal rounds begin at 16:49. Riner is virtually unbeatable. Between September 2010 and February 2020, he won 154 consecutive contests. At the Tokyo Olympics, he had to settle for bronze after losing to Russia’s Tamerlan Bashaev, his first defeat at the Games since 2008. He has not lost at Grand Slam or World Championship level since Tokyo. Gold medal events: Archery (women's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's floor, women's vault, men's pommel horse finals), athletics (men's shot put, women's triple jump, mixed 4x400m relay, women's 100m, men's decathlon), badminton (women's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix special team), fencing (women's sabre team), judo (mixed team), road cycling (men's road race), rowing (women's single sculls, men's single sculls, women's eight, men's eight), shooting (women's 25m pistol, men's skeet), swimming (men's 100m fly, women's 200m individual medley, women's 800m free, mixed 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (women's singles), tennis (women's singles, men's doubles). Highlights Britain’s fastest female sprinter, Dina Asher-Smith, will hope to line up in the 100m final at 20:20. Asher-Smith has changed coach and moved to train in Texas since a disappointing eighth place in last year’s world final. “I want to win the Olympics and I want to run really fast,” she has said. Big rivals include US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson and Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson. Richardson has the year’s leading mark of 10.71 seconds. At 16:10, the pommel horse final is Max Whitlock’s chance to deliver on his aim of an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus. Ireland’s world champion and pommel horse specialist Rhys McClenaghan will have his sights on gold. The women’s vault final (15:20) may feature Simone Biles, the Rio 2016 champion, returning to an event from which she withdrew in Tokyo. This is the last day of rowing and the very last final on the list is the men’s eight (10:10). Britain won this event in 2016 but New Zealand were the winners in Tokyo. GB have recovered to win the past two world titles. Defending champions Canada, Romania and the US are contenders in the women’s eight (09:50). Dressage’s team event concludes from 09:00. GB have not been off the Olympic podium since a memorable victory at London 2012, but can they get back to the top step? Brit watch It is the penultimate night at the pool. GB smashed the world record to win the mixed 4x100m medley relay (20:33) when it was held for the first time at the Tokyo Games. This is a great relay to watch as there is a heap of strategy involved in looking at your team’s strengths and weaknesses, then deciding who you put on which leg. It is often not clear which team’s plan is paying off until the final moments. Cycling returns with the men’s road race (10:00). GB have qualified a full four-man team that features Tom Pidcock, who only just competed in Olympic mountain-biking last week, never mind half of the Tour de France before dropping out with Covid. The course reaches a climax with three laps of cobbled climb before a downhill stretch and a sprint towards the Trocadero. Kayak cross is new at the Olympics. If you have seen snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics then – yes, that, except in whitewater. Instead of the usual Olympic slalom canoeing against the clock, paddlers race each other to the finish. They have to turn around in whitewater, flip their boats and perform all sorts of other manoeuvres along the way. The opening rounds begin at 14:30 and Team GB have some of the world’s best athletes. Saturday’s hockey includes GB’s women versus Argentina at 09:00. World watch Serena Williams, Monica Puig and Belinda Bencic are your last three women’s singles tennis champions at the Olympics. Who will it be this time? World number one Iga Swiatek has Olympic success in her blood – her dad, Tomasz Swiatek, was a rower for Poland at Seoul 1988. The hosts will pin their hopes on Caroline Garcia making it this far. This is also the day of the men’s doubles final, an event that includes Andy Murray and Dan Evans plus Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski for GB. Elsewhere in the night’s swimming action, Katie Ledecky has a shot at a fourth consecutive gold in the women’s 800m freestyle (20:09). It could be close, though. Last time, in Tokyo, Ariarne Titmus was just a second behind her – the first time anyone had been within four seconds of Ledecky in an Olympic final over this distance. On the track, the men’s 100m first round (from 10:45) allows us a first look at world champion Noah Lyles and Christian Coleman, both representing the US, as well as GB trio Zharnel Hughes, Louie Hinchliffe and Jeremiah Azu. Keep an eye out for “Africa’s fastest man” Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya and Jamaican title challenger Kishane Thompson. The decathlon concludes with the 1500m race at 20:45. France’s Kevin Mayer, a silver medallist in Tokyo and Rio, will be trying to upgrade that on home soil, although team-mate Makenson Gletty comes in with a better world ranking. Canada, boasting Olympic champion Damian Warner and world champion Pierce LePage, will be tough to beat. Badminton’s women’s doubles is a big target for Indonesia. Apriyani Rahayu won Tokyo gold with Greysia Polii and is now paired with Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti after Polii’s retirement. China’s Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan are the favourites. The two teams meet each other in the group stages, which may help set the scene for Saturday’s final (15:10). Women football reaches the quarter-final stage with games kicking off at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 20:00. Expert knowledge  Ledecky is not the only athlete capable of racking up a fourth gold medal in an event on Saturday. Skeet shooter Vincent Hancock won gold in Beijing, London and Tokyo for the US, a remarkable record marred only by finishing 15th in Rio. This time around, Hancock is coming in ranked 17th in the world. As of the start of Saturday, only six people have won the same individual event four times at the Olympics: Denmark’s Paul Elvstrom in sailing, Americans Al Oerter and Carl Lewis in athletics, Japan’s Kaori Icho and Cuba’s Mijain Lopez in wrestling, and Michael Phelps for the US in swimming. Nobody has ever won the same individual event five times at the Olympics (although it could happen in Paris – see Tuesday, 6 August). Ledecky at LA 2028, anyone? Olympic Games fan zones to be set up across the UK Olympics 2024: how extreme weather could impact Paris games Gold medal events: Archery (men's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's rings, women's uneven bars, men's vault), athletics (women's high jump, men's hammer throw, men's 100m), badminton (men's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix freestyle individual), fencing (men's foil team), golf (men's round 4), road cycling (women's road race), shooting (women's skeet), swimming (women's 50m free, men's 1500m free, men's 4x100m medley relay, women's 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (men's singles), tennis (women's doubles and men's singles). Highlights Sunday at 20:55 is go time for the men’s 100m final. Will Zharnel Hughes be on the start line for GB after a world bronze last year? Will Noah Lyles become the first American to win this event since 2004? Can Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo pull off an upgrade on last year’s world silver? Roland Garros hosts the Olympic men’s singles final. Many fans would love a Nadal-Djokovic Olympic final on clay here. They have met once before at the Games, in the Beijing 2008 semi-finals, which Nadal won. Realistically, the Spaniard may have a better chance of a medal in the doubles. Serbia's Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to win the one big title still missing from his collection. The final round of the men’s golf competition begins at 08:00. American Xander Schauffele will be in Paris to defend his title, and he has said an Olympic gold medal is proving increasingly valuable in a sport that, until Rio 2016, was all about its four majors. Spain’s Jon Rahm will be one of the highest-profile LIV Golf players at the Games. Lizzie Deignan is the first female British cyclist to be selected for four Olympic Games. Deignan – the London 2012 silver medallist and 2015 world champion – is joined by national champion Pfeiffer Georgi, Anna Henderson and Anna Morris for Sunday’s women’s road race, which starts at 13:00. A strong Dutch team for this race features Ellen van Dijk, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes and Marianne Vos, who won gold in London 12 years ago. Brit watch With Charlotte Dujardin pulling out on Tuesday, team-mate Lottie Fry - daughter of Laura, who rode at Barcelona 1992 – could be one of the biggest challengers in this event. In gymnastics, Jake Jarman won world vault gold last year and backed it up with a European title in April. The 22-year-old has the chance to turn that form into an Olympic title at 15:25. Becky Downie could be a contender in the uneven bars from 14:40. Amber Rutter welcomed her first child to the world in April. Now she’s shooting for skeet gold at Paris 2024 (qualification from 08:30, final from 14:30). Rutter missed Tokyo 2020 through a positive Covid test just before she travelled, which she says was devastating at the time but ultimately helped reshape her life goals to include both personal priorities and Olympic aims. In track and field action, world silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith is in the opening round of the men’s 400m from 18:05. Men’s hockey reaches the quarter-final stages. World watch The first round of the men’s 110m hurdles begins at 10:50. Grant Holloway was the Tokyo favourite until he “lost composure” in his words and allowed Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment to thunder past. Holloway has since won both available world titles and is on the US team for Paris. In the women’s 400m hurdles first round (11:35) watch for another American, defending champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, testing herself against Dutch world champion Femke Bol. The last night of swimming at Paris 2024 (from 17:30) features four finals: the women’s 50m free, men’s 1,500m free, men’s 4x100m medley and women’s 4x100m medley. Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom is a big contender in the women’s 50m free, while the women’s 4x100m medley could turn into a classic US-Australia battle. GB won men’s medley silver in Tokyo. The table tennis men’s singles final could be an opportunity for China’s Ma Long to extend an extraordinary Olympic streak (13:30). Ma comes into the Games having won all five Olympic titles available to him since 2012 – three team, two individual. Expert knowledge We are well into the quarter-finals and semi-finals of boxing’s various weights. In the women’s middleweight division (75kg), where quarter-finals take place on Sunday, UK-based Cindy Ngamba is fighting for the Olympic Refugee Team. Ngamba is unable to return to Cameroon, where she was born, because of her sexuality – homosexuality in the country is punishable with up to five years in prison. She is the first boxer ever selected for an Olympic refugee team. Fencing at Paris 2024 concludes with men’s team foil (19:30), a perfect finale for the hosts, who are the defending champions. To score a point, you need to strike your opponent on their torso, shoulder or neck with the tip of your weapon. You also need to have “right of way” which, if you’re new to fencing, is a concept best left to the referee, who decides which fencer has attacking priority at any given time. In the team event, everyone cycles through a series of mini head-to-head match-ups until one team scores 45. Alternatively, the highest-scoring team wins if the ninth and final bout ends without either team reaching 45.

747,Radcliffe apologises for wishing convicted rapist luck,"Radcliffe competed at the Olympics four times in her running career Former marathon world champion Paula Radcliffe has said she is ""very sorry"" after wishing a convicted rapist competing at the Olympics the ""best of luck"". Steven van de Velde, who was named in the Netherlands beach volleyball squad for Paris 2024, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty to raping a 12-year-old British girl when he was 19. The Dutchman, who met his victim on Facebook, travelled from Amsterdam to the UK and raped the girl at an address in Milton Keynes. The now 29-year-old resumed his volleyball career after serving just 12 months of his four-year sentence and was selected in June for the Dutch Olympic team for the Games. ""I am mortified that I expressed it so badly and didn't condemn the rape out loud,"" said Radcliffe. Earlier, in an interview with radio station LBC on Wednesday, she said: ""I know that he is married now and has settled down. ""I think it's a tough thing to do to punish him twice and if he's managed to successfully turn his life around after being sent to prison, and to qualify and to be playing sport at the highest level, then I actually wish him the best of luck."" She referred to doping offenders being allowed to return to sport after serving bans. In a series of posts on social media, BBC pundit Radcliffe apologised for her remarks. ""I do believe in second chances after serving punishment but think the Olympics should be for those who uphold the ideals - that's why I poorly brought the doping comparison in,"" she added. ""I myself am shocked and disappointed at how I expressed this so badly. ""I am very sorry and should have done much better. I by no means meant to overlook the crime and meant to say those who don't uphold ideals should be excluded but can't be. ""I profoundly apologise and am deeply shocked and disappointed in myself and can't understand how I managed to convey it so badly."" The Steven van de Velde case explained Paris 2024 day-by-day guide Paris 2024 Olympics full schedule Following Van de Velde's initial selection for Paris, the Dutch Olympic Committee (NOC) told BBC Sport: ""After his release, Van de Velde sought and received professional counselling. He demonstrated to those around him - privately and professionally - self-insight and reflection."" The NOC says his return to the sport met guidelines set by the Dutch Volleyball Federation (NeVoBo) in the organisation's 'Guidelines Integrity Record', which sets out conditions for athletes to resume competing after conviction. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the selection of athletes for the Games was the responsibility of individual committees. Van de Velde's inclusion in the Games has been criticised by women's safety groups. Kyniska Advocacy, a UK athlete-led safe sport organisation, is one of the organisations that has called on the IOC to disqualify Van de Velde from the Games. The group's CEO, Mhairi Maclennan, said: ""To have a convicted rapist representing their country on a global stage not only goes entirely against the Olympic ideals and commitments but it shatters the IOC's vision of building 'a better world through sport'."" Reflecting on the radio comments she made about Van de Velde, Radcliffe added: ""I genuinely have no idea why I would ever wish luck when I didn't mean it and sincerely apologise for hurt."" Later on Thursday, Radcliffe issued a second apology to say how ""ashamed"" she was that her words ""so inaccurately represented"" her views. ""I am truly sorry for so wrongly expressing my intended views and understand that this statement can in no way repair the damage but hopefully conveys my deep regret,"" she added on X, external.

749,Low pressure but not low key as Biles returns to Games,"Simone Biles began her training session in Paris on beam - which was the only apparatus final she competed in at the Tokyo Olympics When Simone Biles landed a spectacular vault in Paris on Thursday, she made a huge statement in what is supposed to be a low-pressure return to the Olympic stage. The American, the most decorated gymnast in history with 37 world and Olympic medals, is back after pulling out of several events at the Tokyo Games three years ago with the 'twisties' - a disorientating mental block. Many wondered if they would ever see her at a Games again, but now the 27-year-old is giving herself the chance to add to her seven Olympic medals. She has returned with a new skill - the Yurchenko double pike vault, which was last year named the Biles II after she became the first woman to land it in competition, and which is one of five gymnastic elements named after her.  It was this move that she executed perfectly at the Bercy Arena in podium training - the only chance gymnasts get to practise on the equipment in the venue before they compete there. Nailed, stuck, not a hint of a shuffle. ""She looked good,"" coach Cecile Landi said when asked how Biles had appeared mentally and physically in the training session. For those who witnessed that vault, though, that assessment may have sounded like an understatement. But everything about the USA team's build-up to the Games has been about keeping the pressure off Biles. She and her team-mates were ushered quickly out of the arena after training, with the team deciding to put the coaches forward to speak to the waiting pack of reporters instead. Biles has also been told she does not have to compete in all events if she does not want to.  ""I think it's going to be day by day, we're going to decide after qualification,"" Landi said. ""I think for her just knowing that she has the option to say 'Hey, I maybe want to take one event off out of the whole two weeks,' is mentally helping."" Biles' return to the Olympics may be low pressure, but it will not be low key. It was easy to see where the American was in the arena during this training session - just look for the photographers. And it was impossible to miss the quality of a skill only she can perform. When the arena fills up on Sunday for the women's qualification round, there will be one gymnast everyone is watching.

750,Hayes guides United States to win over Zambia,"The United States have won gold in the women's football events at four of the past seven Olympic Games The United States, managed by former Chelsea boss Emma Hayes, began their women's Olympic football campaign with an emphatic 3-0 win over Zambia in Nice. Trinity Rodman hit the crossbar early on before she gave Hayes' side the lead after 17 minutes. Mallory Swanson scored twice inside a minute to put the United States 3-0 ahead after 25 minutes, with Zambia then reduced to 10 players followed Pauline Zulu's red card. However, despite having a player advantage throughout the second half, the United States could not stretch their lead further. This was Hayes' first competitive match in charge of the United States after she left Chelsea at the end of last season following 12 years in charge. During her time at Stamford Bridge, Hayes guided the Blues to the Women's Super League title seven times, including in each of the past five campaigns.

Hosts France also made a winning start, holding off a Colombia fightback to win 3-2. Two goals from Marie-Antoinette Katoto and one from Kenza Dali put France 3-0 ahead, although a penalty from Catalina Usme and a goal from Manuela Pavi Sepulveda gave Colombia hope.

753,Opening ceremony lights up Paris in unique style,"The Olympic flame was a cauldron shaped like a hot air balloon that rose high above the Parisian sky The 2024 Olympics opened in Paris in spectacular style with thousands of athletes sailing along the River Seine past lively performers on bridges, banks and rooftops in an ambitious take on an opening ceremony.    Swapping a stadium for a waterway for the first time to open the 'greatest show on earth', the near four-hour spectacle culminated in French judo great Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-Jose Perec lighting a cauldron shaped like a hot air balloon that rose high above the Parisian sky. Red, white and blue fireworks had raised the Tricolore above Austerlitz Bridge before 6,800 athletes from 205 delegations travelled on 85 boats and barges past some of the French capital's most famous landmarks. There were surprise performances through the ceremony, including a cabaret number from American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga, as well as an emotional return of Canadian icon Celine Dion.  The day had started with major disruption when the French train network was hit by arson attacks and heavy rain in the evening put paid to the original plan by artistic director Thomas Jolly to use the Parisian sun to ""make the water sparkle"".  The lashing rain may have forced athletes to add rain ponchos and umbrellas to their planned outfits but it did not detract from the lively journey through French history, art and sport told by some 2,000 musicians, dancers and other artists. The last two boats to parade - first the United States as the next hosts for Los Angeles 2028 and then France - had the largest numbers of athletes on board, while other barges carried several delegations together.  Rower Helen Glover and diver Tom Daley were Great Britain's flagbearers in Paris, which is hosting the summer Games for a third time and the first time in 100 years. In opening the 33rd summer Olympics, which are taking part against a difficult international and domestic political backdrop, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach told athletes they were now ""part of an event that unites the world in peace"". More than 10,500 athletes will compete across 32 sports at the Games, which will close on 11 August. Spectacular photos from the Paris 2024 opening ceremony This video can not be played Lady Gaga's performance at the Paris 2024 opening ceremony When organisers first revealed plans to hold the opening ceremony along the river in the heart of the city, rather than in a stadium as is usual, there were some raised eyebrows and questions over how they would manage such a huge security operation. The Seine itself had been under scrutiny for water cleanliness, while simply the logistics of transporting thousands of athletes along a six-kilometre stretch of river without a dress rehearsal seemed ambitious.    But on Friday evening, backed by a security operation involving tens of thousands of police, Paris pulled it off its plan in dazzling fashion. At times it was bizarre - one moment Lady Gaga surrounded by pink and black feathers was singing in French, the next Bangladesh's athletes were being introduced on their boat.  A lot of the time it was brilliantly frenetic and at others, emotional.  Given the miserable weather after what had been a sunny week in Paris until now, it seemed fitting that the storyline at the start of the ceremony was about the arrival of the Olympic flame in Paris not going according to plan. The torchbearer did not get the memo about it not being in the Stade de France, and then Zinedine Zidane's metro train broke down while he was transporting the torch. There followed ballet, cancan, opera, famous artwork coming to life and even Minions - and every so often a masked torchbearer was shown running across rooftops and even zip-lining, while the flotilla made its way from Austerlitz Bridge to Pont d'Iena. The boats with flag-waving athletes passed well-known landmarks like the Louvre museum, Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and Arc de Triomphe and were treated to 12 artistic segments. One segment focused on rebuilding Notre Dame, which was damaged in a fire in 2019. A large troupe of dancers were accompanied by music composed using sounds captured from the iconic cathedral's reconstruction. Another explored French history, with costumed singers performing music from Les Miserables and a choir of headless Marie Antoinettes accompanying French heavy metal band Gojira. French-Malian R&B star Aya Nakamura - the world's most-streamed French-language artist - was among the musical acts.  The ceremony ended in the Trocadero, where the nearby Eiffel Tower lit up, with the flame - which had been on an elaborate journey with a masked torchbearer and a mechanical horse - being passed back to Zidane, who handed it to Rafael Nadal, Nadia Comaneci, Serena Williams and Carl Lewis. The quartet carried the flame on a boat towards the Louvre, where a series of French athletes and para-athletes past and present - including 100-year-old gold-medal cyclist Charles Coste - carried it and eventually handed it to Riner and Perec. And just when you thought the ceremony could not get any more beguiling, the pair lit the 30-metre high hot air balloon that now looks like it is floating above the city. But there was one more magical moment to come, with Dion thrilling the crowds at the Eiffel Tower with a powerful rendition of Edith Piaf’s L’Hymne a l’amour in her first performance since revealing a serious neurological condition in December 2022.  Celine Dion was singing at her second opening ceremony after Atlanta in 1996 Since the last Olympics - the Beijing 2022 Winter Games - wars have started in Ukraine and Gaza. In his speech, IOC president Bach told athletes that ""in a world torn apart by wars and conflicts, it is thanks to this solidarity that we can all come together tonight, uniting the athletes from the territories of all 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team"". Earlier in the ceremony Paris had been plunged into darkness as the first notes of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Imagine - sung by Juliette Armanet on a drifting raft - rang out.  The peace anthem, part of all Olympic opening ceremonies, is aligned with the message of unity and tolerance conveyed by the Games.  The impact of conflicts is being felt at these Olympics, with Russians and Belarusians banned following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just 15 Russian and 17 Belarusian athletes will be competing as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) in Paris and they were not part of the parade at the opening ceremony. Some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for the athletes of the Refugee Olympic Team and the Palestine Olympic Committee. More than 100 heads of state and government were in attendance, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. There are 14 gold medals to be won on Saturday, with the first one most likely to come in shooting's mixed team air rifle. You can follow BBC coverage of day one from 06:30 BST.  Great Britain's best chance of an opening-day medal could come in diving, with Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen in the women’s 3m synchro (from 10:00 BST), or the road cycling time trials (women's event from 13:30 BST, with the men’s at 15:34 BST). Other highlights include a first glimpse of swimmer Adam Peaty in 100m breaststroke heats (from 10:00 BST), Max Whitlock and the rest of GB's men's gymnasts in qualification (from 10:00 BST) and the men's rugby sevens where French fans will hope Antoine Dupont can inspire the hosts to gold (final at 18:45). There are four swimming finals on the opening day in the pool, with the highlight likely to be the women's 400m freestyle (19:55 BST) where US legend Katie Ledecky, Australian defending champion Ariarne Titmus and Canadian world record holder Summer McIntosh are expected to battle it out. The eventing gets under way at Versailles (from 08:30 BST) with Great Britain defending their team crown days after equestrian was rocked by Charlotte Dujardin's withdrawal from the Games, and subsequent provisional suspension, after footage emerged of her ""excessively"" whipping a horse.  The tennis also starts at Roland Garros, with Novak Djokovic in action as well as the men's doubles pairing of Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal, while Great Britain's men start their hockey campaign against Spain.

751,Spectacular photos from the Paris 2024 opening ceremony,"The Olympic opening ceremony presents the host country with the opportunity to wow the world with a uniquely spectacular show.  The opening of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games was just that - the organisers ditched the traditional ceremony, and became the first Games to hold the opening event within a city as a whole rather than in a stadium. Thousands of athletes and performers paraded along the River Seine on a wet evening, before the night sky and the Eiffel Tower were lit up in dramatic technicolour, creating a hugely ambitious, one-of-a-kind spectacle. Below are some of the most eye-catching photos from the night. After a three-month journey from Greece to Paris, the Olympic torch was handed to former French footballer Zinedine Zidane, before being passed on to tennis stars Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams. In an epic climax, French judo great Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-Jose Perec used the Olympic torch to ignite a cauldron powering an enormous hot air balloon. The giant, glowing balloon then flew over the city of Paris to signal the start of the greatest show on Earth. The opening ceremony began with a stunning display of coloured smoke resembling the French flag rising over the Pont d’Austerlitz. Fans and spectators were in keen attendance, and - for the most part - were undeterred by the wet weather. French President Emmanuel Macron was watching alongside President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach.  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was also spotted watching the ceremony, seemingly well-prepared for the rain. Various celebrities attended the evening, including American singer Ariana Grande with her British Wicked co-star Cynthia Erivo. As expected there was a heightened security presence, with tens of thousands of police deployed across the city.

760,Canada used drones before and Tokyo gold could be 'tarnished',"Canada won women's football gold at the last Olympic Games in Tokyo Canada national team officials have used drones prior to the Paris Olympics and their Tokyo 2020 women's gold medal could be tarnished, officials said on Friday. The developments emerged after Bev Priestman was removed as Olympics head coach for Canada's women's team, following the flying of a drone over New Zealand's training session on Monday. Priestman, 38, was described by the head of Canada's Olympic committee as being ""highly likely"" to have been aware of the incident, leading to her suspension by Canada Soccer. Canadian media reported that both of the country's senior teams - men's and women's - have relied on drones for years. There has been pushback against that allegation but also an acknowledgement this was not the first drone deployed. Canada Soccer chief executive Kevin Blue confirmed he had received ""anecdotal feedback"" related to drone use during the men's team's run to the Copa America semi-finals this summer and said coach Jesse Marsch had only been made aware of it after the event. ""I am aware of an instance of attempted drone usage at the Copa America,"" Blue said. ""I have spoken with our current head coach about the incident after it occurred and I know he denounced it as a practice to his staff."" Blue said there may be a ""systemic ethical shortcoming"" that needs to be addressed. Canadian Olympic Committee chief executive David Shoemaker said there ""appears to be information that could tarnish"" Canada's women's football triumph from the Tokyo Games. Shoemaker said: ""It makes me ill, it makes me sick to my stomach to think that there could be something that calls it into question."" Former Canada manager John Herdman said he is ""highly confident"" similar practices were not used during his time at the helm. Englishman Herdman, who was in charge of the Canada men's team at the 2022 World Cup and the women's side at London 2012 and Rio 2016, added he would co-operate with Canada Soccer's internal review. ""I've always gone into Olympic Games, World Cups, big events, with integrity in mind and the ability to compete at the highest level, following the rules and processes. So from my side, I'll help Canada Soccer where I can with that review,"" said Herdman, who now coaches Toronto FC. Former Canada striker Christine Sinclair, the world's all-time leading international goalscorer, said players were never shown drone footage. ""It's unfortunate that players of our national team had to play through condemnable actions by some of their staff as they attempt to defend our gold medal. Actions players have no control over,"" Sinclair said on Instagram. ""I want to be clear that having been a national team player for 23 years, we were never shown or discussed drone footage in team or individual meetings I've been present for."" Priestman removed as Olympic boss over drone incident Canada send two staff members home over drone incident  Priestman served as an assistant coach to Phil Neville with the England women's team. She became Canada boss in October 2020, prior to the delayed Olympics in Japan. She ""voluntarily"" withdrew from Canada's opening 2-1 victory over New Zealand on Thursday, while Jasmine Mander, Priestman's assistant, was sent home along with ""unaccredited analyst"" Joseph Lombardi. In a statement on Wednesday, Priestman said she took responsibility for the actions of her colleagues after a scouting report filed by Lombardi was sent to Mander. On Thursday, a French court said Lombardi had been handed an eight-month suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to flying a drone in an urban area without a licence. Blue said he hoped Fifa, football's world governing body, would not consider sanctions against the country's national team players. ""We admire deeply the will and determination of this group,"" he said. ""The players themselves have not been involved in any unethical behaviour and frankly we ask Fifa to take that into consideration.""

761,French rail sabotage causes chaos as Paris Olympics open,"Everything was in place.  Streets in the centre of Paris were blocked off, metro stations closed and thousands of police, soldiers and other guards deployed to maintain security on the big showpiece day to kick off the Olympics. But the saboteurs struck away from the capital, at five apparently unguarded places.  France's state-owned rail company SNCF said the saboteurs either vandalised or tried to vandalise five signal boxes and electricity installations between 01:00 and 05:30 on Friday. One site was at Courtalain, east of Le Mans and 150km to the south-west of Paris. The local community's social media page posted a picture of burnt-out cables in a shallow gulley, with its protective SNCF paving stones discarded. The SNCF spoke of a ""massive, large-scale attack aimed at paralysing"" its services, involving arson and theft targeting cabling, not just at Courtalain but at Pagny-sur-Moselle, a village outside the eastern city of Metz and Croisilles, not far from the northern city of Arras. Small sites, but at big junctions on the high-speed TGV network. Another attempted attack, on another TGV junction to the south-east of Paris at Vergigny, was foiled by SNCF workers who just happened to be carrying out maintenance on site in the early hours of Friday. The sabotage was clearly co-ordinated and the effects were immediate, on one of the busiest days imaginable for France's highly regarded rail system.  The head of SNCF, Jean-Pierre Farandou, has spoken of a ""premeditated, calculated, co-ordinated"" attack that demanded considerable repair work. Friday 26 July marked the start of the grand départ (big getaway) for many French holidaymakers heading out of the cities. It was also the day of the showpiece opening ceremony that the Paris Olympics organisers have worked on for years. Hundreds of stranded passengers filled the main concourses at Gare du Nord and Gare Montparnasse, two of the big rail hubs in Paris for travellers on lines to the north and west of the capital. Passengers at Gare du Nord waited patiently for news about delayed trains, not just within France but to London, Brussels and Amsterdam. The much-vaunted high-speed TGV network heading in and out of Paris - north to Lille, west to Le Mans and east towards Strasbourg - was down. At the nearby Gare de L'Est, which serves the east, an SNCF official said the company had diverted high-speed TGV trains onto other, slower lines, which would mean long delays and disruptions, but would also keep the network moving. By the afternoon, trains in all three directions were slowly resuming, but with limited services, delays of up to two hours and still some cancellations. ""Everything points us to these fires being deliberate,"" said Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete. ""The timing [of the attacks], the vans that have been recovered after people have fled, the incendiary agents found on the scene."" Clearly acts of sabotage, and evidently timed to cause severe disruption on the day that Paris was trying to show its best face to the world. Caretaker Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said the repercussions for the rail network were massive and serious, and France's intelligence services and forces of order had been deployed to ""find and punish those behind these criminal acts"". French authorities have been on alert for potential acts of sabotage targeting the Games for months. During the spring, they warned that several groups had tried to disrupt Olympic events, including the torch relay that has been going on across France in the run-up to the opening ceremony. It has now emerged that incendiary devices were found on the high-speed TGV line between Aix-en-Provence and Marseille on the day the Olympic flame arrived in France's big southern port on 8 May. Several bottles filled with yellow liquid were found 4km (2.5 miles) outside Aix, according to French TV. But who would want to ruin the plans of hundreds of thousands of French travellers and disrupt the start of the Olympic Games? One security source suggested in French media that the arson attacks bore all the hallmarks of the extreme left. However, Mr Attal has refused to speculate who might have been behind the sabotage. He appealed to the public to be cautious as the investigation was only just starting, although he did say the fact that the saboteurs had targeted ""nerve centres"" on the high-speed network indicated awareness of where it was vulnerable to attack. In recent weeks, Russia has been linked to at least two alleged plots in France. Last month, a Russian-Ukrainian national was arrested at a hotel near Charles de Gaulle Airport on suspicion of being part of a Russian-sabotage campaign, Only this week a Russian man was arrested on suspicion of involvement in a ""destabilisation"" plot targeting the Games.  Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said he was suspected of aiming to ""organise operations of destabilisation, interference, spying"" on behalf of Russia's FSB intelligence service. So far no Russian link has been made by French authorities to Friday's attacks. Mr Darmanin said this month that 3,570 people had been barred from the Games, including people seen as security risks as well as ""dozens of radical individuals close to Islamist, ultra-left and ultra-right circles"". Almost a million people, ranging from athletes and coaches to Olympic volunteers, have gone through a security check ahead of the Games in Paris.  But preventing acts of sabotage at unguarded sites in rural areas is a wholly different prospect.",2024-07-26 23:09:50,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c28eyr3y18yo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
767,Who could have attacked France's high-speed rail?,"For France's Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin - the man with the task of securing the Paris Olympics - the sabotage attacks on the high-speed rail network will have come as a blow.  He has vowed the attackers will all be quickly arrested, but so far he has not indicated who might be to blame.  Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra promised that the culprits were not going to spoil the party, but they struck the TGV network hours before the opening ceremony - causing chaos for travellers and exposing the vulnerability of a symbol of France's technical prowess.  Caretaker Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has advised caution in drawing conclusions, but said those behind the attack clearly had a good understanding of what would cause most damage. Suspicion fell immediately on ultra-left radicals, from security sources briefing French media, but there has been no claim of responsibility from any source. So far all we know is that the methods used to set fire to critical optical fibres and other cables in ducts along the rail network in the early hours of Friday were reminiscent of previous attacks by the extreme left.  When cable ducts were set alight beside railway lines near Hamburg in Germany last September, an anonymous claim appeared on a left-wing website condemning ""capitalist infrastructure"". That is inconclusive, of course, because the broad nature of the French attacks suggests a degree of co-ordination across four distinct regions that would not normally be associated with the extreme left. But whoever did target the rail lines stretching out of Paris in the early hours of 26 July, it was clear they had the Games in their sights.  The big TGV arteries to the north, east and west were all choked off and the high-speed line to the south-east would have been brought to a halt too, but for an alert crew of engineers who by chance spotted a team of saboteurs in ""vans"". Regional forces are collecting evidence under the overall command of the national police, the national gendarmerie as well as the anti-terrorist SDAT. Their biggest hope may be in tracking down the failed saboteurs who fled the scene near Vergigny, apparently leaving their intact incendiary devices behind. There have been attacks on French railways before, including one in January 2023 east of Paris.  Another incident has only just emerged back in early May 2024, on the high-speed line to the south, just outside Aix-en Provence.  It is that attack that bears most similarity to Friday's sabotage, because it reportedly took place on the day the Olympic flame arrived by ship in the southern port of Marseille. So far no arrests appear to have been made. Even though it was a botched attempt, reportedly involving makeshift petrol-bombs, France's security services will be looking at potential links to that attack. Earlier this year, the interior minister warned of an extremely high ""external"" threat, potentially of the type of jihadist attack that was inflicted on the Crocus City Hall in Moscow in March. France has fallen victim in recent years to a wave of deadly jihadist attacks, but none resemble the acts of sabotage inflicted on the rail network. Friday's incidents caused misery for hundreds of thousands of travellers, but no bloodshed. Suspicion will inevitably fall on Russia too, a country in the grip of a full-scale invasion of its neighbour Ukraine, and one that has engaged in a high-profile campaign of disinformation against France. Pro-Kremlin social media accounts have shared a video smearing the Paris Games, ridiculing the quality of water in the River Seine and attacking President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Mr Macron is loathed in Moscow because of his outspoken support for Ukraine. Although Russia has always denied interference, French officials suspect the hand of Moscow in a series of recent incidents aimed at destabilising the French capital. From red hands daubed on the Holocaust Memorial to graffiti on buildings suggesting their balconies might collapse. Only this week, a Russian was arrested in Paris on suspicion of planning to organise acts of ""destabilisation, interference and spying"". The Kremlin says media reports on the man have been ""quite curious"" but says it has not been directly told about the arrest. But none of that necessarily implicates Russia in Friday's co-ordinated attack on what caretaker Prime Minister Gabriel Attal calls ""nerve centres"" on France's high-speed railway network. Because whoever was behind the sabotage knew exactly where to cause maximum disruption. Russia might not have that kind of reach in rural France. The head of state-owned rail company SNCF, Jean-Pierre Farandou, said the saboteurs had focused on intersections that would have caused the most serious impact.  The arson attack at Courtalain cut off two high-speed lines on the Atlantic artery, one that headed west towards Brittany and another towards Bordeaux in the south-west. The eastern attack knocked out high-speed lines to Metz in one direction and Strasbourg in another. One French security expert, Romain de Calbiac, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the attack was remarkably well-planned.  ""The French security forces and the entire intelligence community here is very concerned that they might have received internal help from people working or people partnering with the railway network in France,"" he said.  ""Another option would be that this information came not from inside sources, but potentially from foreign states with a knowledge of how the French network works."" Earlier this year, SNCF highlighted an increase in the trend for attacks on the rail network and said it was constantly on the look-out for acts of sabotage, ""particularly in the run-up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games"". Although the company said it had detected all the attacks on its systems, it was only able to prevent one from causing significant damage, and that was a stroke of luck. ""Today should have been a party,"" said Jean-Pierre Farandou. ""All that is ruined.""",2024-07-26 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd16en19gd3o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
766,Celine Dion makes stirring comeback at Olympics,"Celine Dion has returned to the stage for the first time since revealing a serious health condition, delivering a typical powerhouse performance at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony. The Canadian superstar had been rumoured to be singing a duet with Lady Gaga, but instead went solo on the Eiffel Tower to bring the four-hour event to a stirring climax. It was Dion's first live performance for four years, and came a year and a half after she revealed a diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). SPS is a rare neurological disorder that causes muscles to spasm and can be debilitating. It also affected her distinctive forceful voice.  The 56 year old, known as the ""queen of power ballads"", has been having therapy to ""rebuild"" her voice, as she told the BBC in June, and help her sing again. On Friday, her delivery of Edith Piaf's classic L'Hymne à l'Amour gave encouraging signs that the treatment is working. She was accompanied by a pianist on the first level of the Eiffel Tower, beneath giant illuminated Olympic rings. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that she “is a Canadian icon, an incredible talent, and she overcame a lot to be there tonight”. He added: “Celine, it’s great to see you singing again”. Italian singer Laura Pausini wrote: “My hands were shaking and my eyes were crying as I listened and saw my beloved Celine Dion."" Her appearance had been hotly anticipated, with crowds of fans waiting outside her hotel in the city in recent days. Dion has a big following in France. Her 1995 album D'eux is the best-selling French-language album of all time. Friday's appearance was the second time that Dion, known for hits including My Heart Will Go On and It's It's All Coming Back to Me Now, had participated in an Olympic opening ceremony, after Atlanta 1996. And her comeback performance came six months after a surprise appearance to present an award at the Grammys.  She has also teased a new residency in Las Vegas. ""We have been working so hard to put this show together - because I’m back,"" she told the BBC in June. She already holds the record for the most successful residency of all time on the Las Vegas strip. Last month, she discussed her struggles with SPS in a film called I Am: Celine Dion, which Amazon Prime Video said on Thursday had become its most successful documentary ever.",2024-07-26 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerkx08dw0o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
771,Aniston criticises JD Vance 'childless cat ladies' comment,"Jennifer Aniston has criticised Donald Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, for resurfaced comments calling Democrats a ""bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives"". The Friends actress, 55, posted a 2021 interview with Mr Vance that has been widely shared since his selection as Mr Trump's running mate for November's presidential election. ""I truly can’t believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""All I can say is… Mr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Mr Vance has a two-year-old daughter, and two sons.  ""I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,"" Ms Aniston wrote. ""Because you are trying to take that away from her, too."" The actress has previously spoken openly about her struggles while trying to have children through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Last month, Mr Vance voted to block Democrat-proposed legislation to guarantee access to IVF nationwide. Ahead of that vote, Mr Vance and the other 48 Senate Republicans signed a letter saying they supported IVF, but that the Democratic bill was overly broad and ""false fearmongering"". In the clip, Mr Vance criticised Vice-President Kamala Harris because she has no biological children. Ms Harris is stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children. But Mr Vance told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson the US was run by ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too"". ""Look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,"" he said. ""How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?"" Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, posted a reaction to Mr Vance's comments on Instagram on Thursday. “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like cole and I?” the 25-year-old daughter of Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and his ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, wrote. Cole Emhoff is her 29-year-old brother. The BBC has contacted the Trump-Vance campaign team for comment. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also addressed the comments earlier this week, speaking about adopting twins with his husband, Chasten. ""The really sad thing is he said that after Chasten and I had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey,"" Mr Buttigieg told CNN’s The Source programme. ""He couldn’t have known that - but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children."" There has also been backlash from fans of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who has no children - and three cats. ""It's bold, for someone seeking votes, to hone in on 'childless cat ladies' when the leader of Childless Cat Ladies is Taylor Swift,"" British writer Caitlin Moran posted on X. Another X user shared the Time magazine cover where Swift posed with one of her cats, writing: ""Hell hath no fury like a certain childless cat lady who has yet to endorse a presidential candidate."" In 2022, Aniston told Allure she wished someone had told her to freeze her eggs. ""It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,"" she said. ""All the years and years of speculation... it was really hard.  ""I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it."" But she had ""zero regrets"". ""I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favour.' You just don't think it. So here I am today,"" she told the magazine. ""The ship has sailed.""",2024-07-26 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3pz2pz8no,Unknown,Unknown,,True
792,Trump courts crypto industry votes and campaign donations,"Donald Trump has told one of the largest cryptocurrency events of the year that if he is re-elected president he will fire the chairperson of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the first day. Trump was the keynote speaker at Bitcoin 2024 on Saturday, a gathering of industry heavyweights in Nashville, Tennessee. The Republican presidential candidate used the event to court voters and encourage campaign donations from the tech community. Cryptocurrency has emerged as a political battleground for Republicans, with Trump claiming the Democratic Party and Vice-President Kamala Harris were “against crypto”. The audience was at its most animated when Trump declared “on day one I will fire Gary Gensler”, the SEC chair nominated by current President Joe Biden. The crowd cheered loudly and started to chant “Trump” at this declaration. Mr Gensler led a crackdown on the crypto industry, and has previously said the sector is rife with “hucksters”.  The SEC brought charges against the ""King of Crypto"" Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years for stealing billions of dollars from customers of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Speaking for about 45 minutes, Trump outlined some of his ideas for the sector if he were to win November's election. He said he would make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. His support for the industry is a 180 turn from his comments in 2021, when he told Fox Business he saw Bitcoin as a “scam” affecting the value of the US dollar. Trump told the crowd at the event he would keep 100% of Bitcoin that the US government currently holds or acquires, adding that it would be a “national Bitcoin stockpile”.  The former president also said he would “immediately appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council”. He talked about the power needed to mine cryptocurrency. “You need tremendous amounts of electricity” he said, adding he would build powerplants “to get that done” and would be “using fossil fuels”. There has been increasing support among some tech leaders for Trump’s presidential campaign in recent months. Tesla founder Elon Musk, who is the world’s richest person, has endorsed Trump. And crypto tycoons, the Winklevoss twins, who were at Saturday's speech, have also rallied behind him. Trump brought up that his campaign takes cryptocurrency donations, saying in the two months since he allowed crypto transactions, he received $25m (£20m) in donations. However, he did not say how much of the payments were from cryptocurrency. Trump used his speech to frame cryptocurrency regulation as a partisan issue, saying the Biden administration was “anti-crypto”.  A number of Republican lawmakers also attended Trump’s speech, including Senators Tim Scott and Tommy Tuberville. Former Republican presidential candidate and Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy was there as well. Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr and Democratic Party lawmakers Wiley Nickel and Ro Khanna also spoke at the event. Earlier at Bitcoin 2024 , Democratic congressman Nickel said Kamala Harris was taking a “forward-looking approach to digital assets and blockchain technology”.",2024-07-27 23:11:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4n2xdylvo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

""I'm sorry my love, I'm so sorry,"" he wrote on Instagram in a post dedicated to his wife, Chiara Bontempi Tamberi.  The athlete blamed ""losing too many kilos"" and ""irrepressible enthusiasm"" for the mishap.  ""If it had to happen, if I had to lose this ring, I couldn't imagine a better place,"" he wrote, claiming the ring will now ""remain forever in the riverbed of the city of love"".  He called the bad luck ""poetic"" and suggested they throw Chiara's ring in the river too.  ""[Then] they will be together forever and we will have one more excuse to renew our vows and marry again,"" he said.  ""Only you could turn this into something romantic,"" Chiara wrote under her husband's apology. The pair have been married since September 2022.  Tamberi was waving Italy's flag alongside three-time Olympic medal winner Arianna Errigo when the ring fell off, bounced off the boat and disappeared into the river.  He described it as ""a few moments that lasted forever"".  Tamberi previously hit the headlines at the Tokyo 2020 Games after he shared the high jump gold medal with Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim. Both opted not to go beyond the 2.37m bar they had cleared. He has also gained attention for sporting a half-shaven beard during competitions since 2011 as his ""trademark"" style.

784,Canada deducted points and coach banned over drone,"Bev Priestman was appointed by Canada in 2020 Canada's women's football team have been deducted six points from their group in the Olympics and coach Bev Priestman has been banned for one year after a drone was used to spy on a rival team's training sessions. Fifa announced the sanctions - which include a £175,720 fine for the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) - a day after English-born Priestman was removed as Canada's Olympic head coach. CSA officials Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander have also been suspended by Fifa for a year. Football's governing body Fifa said the use of the drone by Canada's team was in ""violation"" of its principles. ""The officials were each found responsible for offensive behaviour and violation of the principles of fair play in connection with the CSA's Women’s representative team's drones usage in the scope of the Olympic football tournament,"" said a Fifa statement. Priestman ""voluntarily"" withdrew from her coaching duties for Canada's opening game against the Kiwis after the New Zealand Olympic Committee reported a drone was flown over their training session on Monday. Fifa and the CSA launched investigations and the latter said the 38-year-old was ""highly likely"" to have been aware of the incident. The CSA can appeal against the decision before the Court of Arbitration for Sport and in a statement reacting to the sanctions, its chief executive Kevin Blue and Canadian Olympic Committee chief executive David Shoemaker both said an appeal was under consideration. ""We are exploring options to appeal on the basis that it is excessively punitive towards our Women’s National Team players – who were not involved in any unethical behaviour,"" Blue said. ""Canada Soccer took swift action to suspend the implicated staff members and is also proceeding with a broad independent review that may lead to further disciplinary action."" Shoemaker added: ""We feel terrible for the athletes on the Canadian Women's Olympic Soccer Team who as far as we understand played no role in this matter."" Canada used drones before and Tokyo gold could be 'tarnished' Canada send two staff members home over drone incident  Priestman removed as Olympic boss over drone incident In a statement on Wednesday, Priestman said she took responsibility for the actions of her colleagues after a scouting report filed by Lombardi was sent to Mander. On Thursday, a French court said Lombardi had been given an eight-month suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to flying a drone in an urban area without a licence. The following day Shoemaker said there ""appears to be information that could tarnish"" Canada's women's football triumph from the Tokyo Games. It followed Canadian media reports that drones had been used at previous tournaments. Assistant coach Andy Spence will take charge for the remainder of the Games, with the defending Olympic champions' next game against France on Sunday.

781,Top five stories from day one of Paris Olympics 2024,"Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen became the first Britons to win an opening day medal since fellow divers Peter Waterfield and Leon Taylor at Athens 2004 Great Britain enjoyed their best opening day at an Olympic Games for 44 years as Paris 2024 got under way. Team GB divers Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen took a dramatic bronze in the women's synchronised 3m springboard, before Anna Henderson rode to silver in the women's cycling time trial. The medal successes ensured it was Team GB's most profitable first day of an Olympics since 1980 in Moscow. After a rain-soaked but spectacular opening ceremony on Friday, the wet weather continued on Saturday with several scheduled events rescheduled, including the men's skateboard street event being moved to Monday. There was also medal joy for host nation France and a strong start for some of the Games' most recognisable names. What's happening and when at Paris 2024 Full Paris schedule Paris Olympics medal table Day One - as it happened How to follow Paris 2024 across the BBC This video can not be played Henderson won an impressive silver medal Amid treacherous conditions for cycling at high speed through the Paris streets, Team GB's Henderson finished the time trial in 41 minutes and nine seconds to claim silver behind Grace Brown of Australia, who was a remarkable 90 seconds faster. American Chloe Dygert fell less than a second short of Henderson's time to end up in third place. It was a gutsy performance from Henderson, especially so as the 25-year-old has twice broken her collarbone this season. She kept her nerve and her balance as others fell around her on the slippery surface. There was bad news, however, for GB's Josh Tarling, who missed out on a medal in the men's time trial after sustaining a puncture. He finished fourth, pipped to the podium. Earlier in the diving, Harper and Mew Jensen were only in sixth place with two dives remaining and were fourth before their final attempt. Australia looked set for bronze at worst, but an excellent final effort by the British pair moved them into third and a horrible mistake on Australia's final dive meant they failed to overhaul Harper and Mew Jensen. The bronze-winning pair were in tears at the end of the competition as they snatched Britain's first women's diving medal at an Olympics for 64 years, finishing behind impressive duos from China and the United States.

But inspired by Antoine Dupont, France came from behind - with two of their four tries scored by the 15-a-side captain - to make history. Earlier, Shirine Boukli opened France's medal account with bronze in the women's -48kg judo, while Luka Mkheidze reached the final of the men's -60kg. Mkheidze had to settle for silver as he was beaten by Yeldos Smetov of Kazakhstan. France thought they were on course for a gold medal in the women's epee fencing when Auriane Mallo-Breton led 7-1 over Vivian Kong of Hong Kong, but Kong produced a stunning fightback to clinch a dramatic 13-12 win in overtime.

793,Venezuela holds elections on Sunday. Could real change be coming?,"“She’s going to rot in jail. No one is going to get her out.” That was what prison guards told the family of Emirlendris Benítez. She disappeared in Venezuela in August 2018 after she and her partner - a taxi driver - were arrested while giving somebody a lift to the city centre. She was arbitrarily accused of organising a plot to kill the president and, without a fair trial, given a 30-year prison sentence. When she was taken to prison, she was pregnant. Guards beat her stomach despite her protestations, and she had a miscarriage. Her family tell us she has faced torture in prison, including having her nails removed with a hammer. The human rights group Foro Penal says there were 15,700 politically motivated arbitrary arrests in Venezuela between 2014 and 2023 and hundreds of people remain behind bars. It is one of many ways the government has cracked down on dissent. The BBC asked the government and prosecutor for a comment or interview and have received no response. President Nicolás Maduro has been in power since taking over from his mentor Hugo Chávez in 2013 and is seeking re-election on Sunday. Photos of him line the streets, and on the last day of campaigning in Caracas hundreds of buses were paid for to transport people from around the country to his final rally where free food parcels were handed out as an incentive to attend. Venus, a woman at the rally, says Mr Maduro’s PSUV party has given her many “benefits”. “We are here to support Nicolas Maduro to the end,” she says. Iván, another supporter, says “to those who oppose us, those who say there is no democracy, that there is a dictatorship here… this revolution will continue to shine"". Even some supporters of Mr Maduro, though, have fallen victim to the crackdown on dissent. A family member of Emirlendris, Ana (not her real name), spoke to us on condition of anonymity. Her family voted for Nicolás Maduro, and Hugo Chávez before him, but say now “everything changed because we realised how justice works in Venezuela”. “The government is desperate because it knows it has lost. Many people have opened their eyes and are realising the reality we live in in Venezuela. In the name of Almighty God, I hope that a new president wins for a better Venezuela.” The last election was widely seen as neither free nor fair, many countries refused to recognise Mr Maduro as president, and the US imposed further sanctions on Venezuela. For the first time in years, the opposition feel they have huge momentum and a lead in the polls - making it harder for the governing party to claim victory. But the government has deployed a range of tactics with the armed forces, electoral and judicial authorities which it controls to pre-emptively suppress the opposition. They include detaining critics, uninviting EU election observers, and preventing millions of Venezuelans overseas from registering to vote. Alcides Bracho is a teacher who was detained on 4 July 2022 after going to a protest calling for better salaries. “We are talking 800 days without an increase, and it is a salary of $3.50 per month,” he recalls. But after the protest, he was arrested and accused of “terrorism”. “They came to the house, approximately 22 people with long rifles. Guns that looked like those in action movies or boys’ video games. Without a search warrant.” He was forced to stand naked for 72 hours while he was held in detention, with no access to food, water or a toilet after being sentenced to 16 years in prison for “conspiracy” and “criminal association”. “I thought I was going to die.” “If you want to start a business in Venezuela, let it be a prison. They charge you for everything. The state does not give you food,” he said of the lack of even the most basic things in jail. He was eventually released in a prisoner exchange with the US last December in which 19 political prisoners were freed in exchange for Alex Saab, an accused money launderer with close links to President Maduro who was indicted in the US. Despite what happened to him, Mr Bracho wants to keep fighting. “If we all keep quiet, if no-one does it, there is no fighting.” “There is an upswing in repression. We are very worried. It’s not like I can start my life again, I don’t have a safe space.” The opposition leader, María Corina Machado, was banned from running in Sunday's election, dozens of her team have been detained, and even food stalls that served her have been shut down. Most television and radio stations are state-run, with many other digital media outlets being blocked. Bus TV is a campaign of volunteers who read out “real news” on buses around the country. Andrés Brancovic is one of the volunteers. He thinks “censorship” could affect the election. “Twitter is one of the most used apps in Venezuela right now, because people can post what they want and see what is happening. But people who just have national TV in their houses - they don’t see what is happening with the opposition.” “All the news is in favour of the regime,” he says. Despite having the world’s largest known oil reserves, Venezuela is desperately poor. More than half the population of Venezuela lives in poverty, and nearly eight million people have fled the country - contributing to a migration crisis on the US border. Jhonatan Marcano lives with his family of five in one small room. He goes out fishing every day in a rubber tyre, often in dangerous tides, to feed his family. He cannot afford a boat, nor fuel for one. He relies on the tide to bring him back to land every day. “I always voted for the people who are in charge. Chávez inspired confidence in me.” Now, though, he is undecided: “Help doesn’t come, what you need most does not come to you. I’m so disappointed in the party.” President Maduro blames US sanctions for the country’s woes, but critics also put it down to corruption and economic mismanagement. There are reasons the West wants to improve relations with Venezuela - the oil and natural resources the country has, the fact Iran, China and Russia rely on Venezuela as an ally in the West, and because they do not want the US migration crisis to worsen. But it is unlikely sanctions will be lifted and the government recognised if the vote is seen as unfair again.

797,South Korea wrongly introduced as North Korea at Olympics,"Olympic organisers have issued a ""deep apology"" after South Korea's athletes were mistakenly introduced as North Korea at the opening ceremony in Paris. As the excited, flag-waving team floated down the River Seine, both French and English announcers introduced them as the ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" - the official name of North Korea. The same name was then used - correctly - when North Korea's delegation sailed past. The two Koreas have been divided since the end of World War Two, with tensions between the states further escalating recently. The subtitle which ran across the bottom of the television broadcast showed the correct title, however. The South Korean sports ministry said it planned to lodge a ""strong complaint with France on a government level"" over the embarrassing gaffe. In a statement, the ministry expressed ""regret over the announcement... where the South Korean delegation was introduced as the North Korean team."" The statement added that the second vice sports minister, Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, had demanded a meeting with Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued an apology on its official Korean-language X account, saying: ""We would like to offer a deep apology over the mistake that occurred in the introduction of the South Korean delegation during the opening ceremony."" South Korea, formally known as the Republic of Korea, has 143 athletes in its Olympic team this year, competing across 21 sports. North Korea has sent 16 athletes. This is the first time it has competed in the games since Rio 2016.",2024-07-27 23:11:01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmj2r1403jpo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
799,Celine Dion dazzles Olympics after four-year health absence,"Celine Dion has returned to the stage for the first time since revealing a serious health condition, delivering a typical powerhouse performance at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony. The Canadian superstar had been rumoured to be singing a duet with Lady Gaga, but instead went solo on the Eiffel Tower to bring the four-hour event to a stirring climax. It was Dion's first live performance in four years, and came a year and a half after she revealed a diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). SPS is a rare neurological disorder that causes muscles to spasm and can be debilitating. It also affected her distinctive, forceful voice.  The 56-year-old, known as the ""queen of power ballads"", has been having therapy to ""rebuild"" her voice, she told the BBC in June.  On Friday, her delivery of Edith Piaf's classic L'Hymne à l'Amour gave encouraging signs that the treatment is working. She was accompanied by a pianist on the first level of the Eiffel Tower, beneath giant illuminated Olympic rings. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that she ""is a Canadian icon, an incredible talent, and she overcame a lot to be there tonight"". He added: ""Celine, it’s great to see you singing again."" Italian singer Laura Pausini wrote: ""My hands were shaking and my eyes were crying as I listened and saw my beloved Celine Dion."" Her appearance had been hotly anticipated, with crowds of fans waiting outside her hotel in the city in recent days. Dion has a big following in France. Her 1995 album D'eux is the best-selling French-language album of all time. Friday's appearance was the second time that Dion, known for hits including My Heart Will Go On and It's All Coming Back to Me Now, had participated in an Olympic opening ceremony, after Atlanta 1996. And her comeback performance came six months after a surprise appearance to present an award at the Grammys.  She has also teased a new residency in Las Vegas.  ""We have been working so hard to put this show together - because I’m back,"" she told the BBC in June. She already holds the record for the most successful residency of all time on the Las Vegas strip. Last month, she discussed her struggles with SPS in a film called I Am: Celine Dion, which Amazon Prime Video said on Thursday had become its most successful documentary ever.",2024-07-27 23:11:02,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerkx08dw0o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
804,Peaty qualifies fastest in bid for third straight gold,"This video can not be played Peaty wins 100m breaststroke semi-final Adam Peaty qualified fastest for Sunday’s final as he chases a sensational third consecutive 100m breaststroke Olympic gold in Paris. The 29-year-old Briton, aiming to become the second man after the great American Michael Phelps to win the same individual event at three Games in a row, won his semi-final in 58.86 seconds. That was 0.07secs quicker than his big rival China’s Qin Haiyang, who won the second semi-final. The much-anticipated final is at 20:44 BST on Sunday evening. ""There's a lot to work on still technically. It is really tough on that back end,"" Peaty told the BBC. ""I know this field has been a bit slower, all respect due. This is the way the Olympics work. It ain't about a time here, it is about the races."" Elsewhere, Team GB missed out on a medal in the 4x100m freestyle relays as the men finished fifth and the women seventh while Australia’s Ariarne Titmus won a high-class 400m freestyle final. This video can not be played Peaty wins 100m breaststroke semi-final Peaty cruised to his previous two Olympic golds, in 2016 and 2021, but has struggled with injury and his mental health since the last Games in Tokyo.  He took a break from the sport and considered stopping entirely and in his absence at last year’s World Championships Qin emerged as a serious rival.  Qin swam a 57.69-second 100m last year, making him the second-fastest of all time behind Peaty and the quickest of anyone since Tokyo - but the Uttoxeter swimmer's 57.94 at the British trials signalled a return to form. Although he was well adrift of that time at an electric La Defense Arena in Paris, he was the more comfortable of the two in the semi-finals and looked content as he nodded towards the big screen after beating his rivals. ""If you're Peaty watching this you're thinking 'this is mine tomorrow',"" said Adrian Moorhouse, Britain’s 1988 gold medallist in the event. ""You have got to be. Qin is not on it. The rest of the field caught him. He didn't have enough."" Britain’s James Wilby was fifth in Peaty's race and missed out on the final. In the relays, the male British quartet qualified for the final third-fastest but were never really in contention as the United States cruised to gold, Australia took silver and Italy bronze. Matt Richards, Tom Dean and Duncan Scott, who made up the quartet along with Jacob Whittle, will be favourites to defend their 4x200m freestyle title on Tuesday. Australia outclassed the US to win gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle. That was Australia's second gold of the night after Titmus earlier denied American Katie Ledecky an eighth Olympic gold, which would have equalled the record for a female swimmer. Canada's 17-year-old sensation Summer McIntosh took silver and Ledecky bronze.

803,Harper & Mew Jensen win Team GB's first Paris medal,"This video can not be played Team GB's Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen win bronze at the Paris Olympics Divers Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen won Team GB's first medal on the opening day of the Olympics since 2004 with a dramatic bronze in the women's synchronised 3m springboard in Paris. The pair were in tears at the end of the competition as they snatched Britain’s first female diving medal at an Olympics for 64 years behind China and the United States. They were sixth with two dives to go and fourth before the final dive but an excellent final effort moved them into third. Australia still looked set for bronze at worst, but a horrible mistake on their final dive was greeted by gasps from the crowd at the Paris Aquatics Centre and they failed to overhaul Harper and Mew Jensen. Londoner Mew Jensen, competing at her second Olympics, sustained a partial fracture in her back just three months ago which limited her to just a month’s preparation.  Her stunned expression soon turned to tears of joy after the Australian error.  ""A month ago I didn't think I would be here,"" Mew Jensen, 22, said. ""To be up on the boards and to come away with that [bronze medal], I can't imagine anything better."" Chester-born Harper, who turns 24 on Sunday, said: ""It is all we have worked towards. To come away with the medal feels really, really amazing."" Gold for world champions Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen was rarely in doubt in an impressive performance which sealed a sixth consecutive gold for China in this event.

""You have got to push doubts to the side,"" she said. ""Yas has been completely supportive."" The pair, who are staying together in the Olympic village and were sporting elaborate nail art painted by Harper with equipment she has brought to Paris, were second after the opening round of dives but slipped down the standings after small errors in their next two efforts. That left them in sixth, but only nine points separated them from the bronze medal position before a strong fourth dive moved the British pair back into contention. Harper and Mew Jensen followed their score of 71.10 with 70.68 on their final dive, but that only gave them an advantage of 58.68 over Australian pair Anabelle Smith and Maddison Keeney – the world silver medallists. On their final dive, Smith almost slipped from the board, doing well to even make it into the pool, and they scored just 48.60 to finish fifth. “We knew even if we did a good one we would still be on the back foot,” Mew Jensen said. “We knew Australia needed to mess up. “For that to actually happen, we were very, very shocked. They are very talented and experienced.” Smith said: ""We’re disappointed, obviously.  ""I made a pretty big mistake, when we were in a good position to medal, but that’s diving. Sometimes you can’t control that. It’s just unlucky.” Great Britain's last medal on the opening day of an Olympics was won by Peter Waterfield and Leon Taylor, who was part of the BBC commentary team in Paris. ""Right place, right time,"" Taylor said of the British medal. ""That's what happens in diving. What an incredible competition."" Mew Jensen and Harper had won bronze and silver medals at the World Championships in recent years but this was not one of the 63 medals Team GB are predicted to win in Paris. The diving continues on Monday when Tom Daley will compete at his fifth Olympics alongside Noah Williams in the 10m synchronised event, in which they are among the favourites.

800,Is Biles about to perform another new move at Olympics?,"Simone Biles already has five skills named after her but none on uneven bars Simone Biles is making her return to Olympic competition on Sunday even more hotly anticipated with the possibility she may perform another new move. The American, the most decorated gymnast in history with 37 world and Olympic medals, will get the first chance to try to get an uneven bars skill named after her in the women's qualifying event at Paris 2024. The 27-year-old already has five other eponymous skills but this would be the first one on bars and would make her the only active female gymnast to have one on all four apparatus. She submitted the original skill to the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) technical committee last week and so if she performs it cleanly here in Paris, it will bear her name. Biles is back on the Olympic stage three years after pulling out of several events at the last Games in Tokyo with the 'twisties' - a disorientating mental block. She already announced her arrival as a huge favourite to add to her seven Olympic medals when she nailed her Biles II vault in podium training on Thursday - the most recent of the skills named after her.  She and her American team have been keen to keep the pressure off her at these Games, with her coach fulfilling media commitments on her behalf and the gymnast herself being reassured that she does not need to compete in all events. Bars would be the most likely one she would opt out of - with it being her 'weakest', if you can call an apparatus on which she has a world silver medal. Perhaps you can if 'just' one out of 30 world medals has come on bars. However, with this new skill in the mix, that now seems unlikely. She is scheduled to begin her qualification round at 10:40 BST on Sunday, the session after Great Britain's women begin their Olympic campaign (08:30 BST) Low pressure but not low key as Biles returns to Games  'Paris Olympics can be redemption for Biles' This video can not be played Paris Olympics 2024: Simone Biles talks about the 'trauma' of Tokyo and her journey back FIG describes the uneven bars skill as ""a clear hip circle forward with one-and-a-half turns to handstand"". In other words, when she starts in a handstand on the upper bar, the American would dip her body to travel around the bar and then rise back into a handstand before doing one and a half pirouettes (540 degrees) and then stop to hold a handstand position. The governing body says if she attempts the skill it is likely to be at the beginning of her routine where she performs a Weiler. The new skill is a variation of the one first done by Canadian gymnast Wilhem Weiler. ""In order for the move to be named for her, Biles will have to perform it without a major fault at some phase of the competition in Paris,"" said FIG, which has given it a difficulty value of 0.5 points., external Biles already has five elements named after her - two vaults, two floor tumbling skills and a beam dismount. Only Soviet five-time Olympic champion Nellie Kim has more, with seven. Biles' most recent eponymous skill - the Biles II vault - was on show in podium training at the Bercy Arena in Paris on Thursday, where she landed it perfectly. She only added this skill - a Yurchenko double pike - last year and so if she performs it at these Games that would also be an Olympic first. The five skills she has named after her are: Biles on floor: double layout with half-twist ie a double somersault in stretched position with a half twist (named after her in 2013) Biles II on floor: triple-twisting double somersault (named after her in 2019) Biles on vault: round-off on to springboard, back handspring with half-turn on to vault, followed by double-twisting somersault in stretched position (named after her in 2018) Biles II on vault: Round-off on to board, back handspring on to vault, then double somersault in piked position (named after her in 2023) Biles on beam: double-double dismount ie a double-twisting, double somersault backwards off beam at end of routine (named after her in 2019)  Today's Olympics guide Full Paris Olympics schedule BBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule",2024-07-27 23:11:03,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cx02vxk9dk5o,Sonia Oxley,2024-07-27 20:11:03,,True
812,Simone Biles draws A-list celebrity crowd at Paris Olympics,"As Simone Biles eyes up a chance at another Olympic medal, a row of A-list celebrities are watching on. The seven-time medallist is one of the most high profile athletes at the Olympics, and her first performance in the artistic gymnastics on Sunday drew celebrities like it was Paris Fashion Week. Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Tom Cruise, American Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and Snoop Dogg were in the crowd to watch the American gymnast. Grande sat with Cynthia Erivo, the pair co-staring in their upcoming film Wicked. They were seen greeting Wintour, who was with Australian film director Baz Luhrmann. Higher in the stands was singer Nick Jonas, seen chatting with singer John Legend and his wife, model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen. Academy Award-winning actress Jessica Chastain was also at Bercy Arena to watch Biles perform. Biles is considered by many to be the GOAT of women’s gymnastics (the greatest of all time). And her considerable medal haul (which includes four Olympic golds and 30 world championship medals) could have potentially been higher heading into the 2024 Olympics, if it wasn’t for her infamous case of the “twistys” at the Tokyo Games.  Biles was forced to pull out of several events at the Tokyo Olympics after suffering a disorientating mental block, and many wondered if she would compete again. Her return to the Olympics stage is a major drawcard, and Biles rewarded the crowd with a dazzling performance. She entered the Bercy Arena on Sunday to an eruption of cheers, with celebrities in the stands and a global television audience of millions. An acrobatic beam routine came before an energetic floor programme that featured one of the five skills named after her. Then she delivered her big Biles II vault but decided not to attempt the new skill she is planning on uneven bars. She scored a total of 59.566 to top the all-around standings with three sub-divisions still to go. It is hard to see that changing - that score would have won the last three World Championships.",2024-07-28 23:10:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxq5l9l94zo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
807,France rail repairs completed after arson attacks,"France's national rail operator says it has finished repairing infrastructure damaged in a suspected coordinated arson attack on Friday. State-owned SNCF said most trains were running as planned on Sunday and full service will resume on Monday. Police are still searching for the perpetrators behind what French ministers and officials have described as ""sabotage"" designed to paralyse high-speed TGV lines running to and from Paris. Hundreds of thousands of people were caught up in the resulting disruption, which came hours before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in the capital. SNCF said staff have been working around the clock to manually repair fibre optic cables, which were targeted on the North, Brittany and South-West lines. Rail workers foiled an attempt to destroy safety equipment on a fourth line. On Sunday, the rail company said the main western line from Paris was operating almost as normal, while three out of four TGV trains were running on the northern line from Lille, with no delays expected. SNCF said around 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday, while junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete estimated as many as 800,000 people could be impacted over three days. Eurostar - which runs international services from London to Paris and uses a high-speed line in France - was also impacted. It said one in four of its trains would not run over the weekend. Among those caught up in the disruption on Friday was Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who had planned to travel to the Games' opening ceremony via train but was forced to fly instead. He told the BBC: ""I’m not going to pretend it wasn’t frustrating because it was, and for very many people it made travel so much harder.""

Spectators in the Pierre Mauroy stadium on Sunday booed as the Sudanese anthem was played instead of that of South Sudan.  The audio was corrected after a short pause, followed by an ovation from the crowd.  The organisers of the Olympic Games in Paris released a statement apologising for the ""human error"". One of South Sudan's players later told reporters the gaffe was ""disrespectful"".  ""They [the organisers] have to be better because this is the biggest stage, and you know that South Sudan is playing,"" said Majok Deng. ""There’s no way you can get that wrong by playing a different anthem. It’s disrespectful,"" he continued. ""Obviously, nobody’s perfect. They made a mistake. They played it at the end, and we moved on.""  The organisers of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games gave their ""most sincere apologies to the team from South Sudan and their supporters for the human error.""  ""We fully understand the gravity of the mistake,"" the statement read.  It is the second time organisers have had to apologise for such a gaffe - during the opening ceremony on Friday, South Korea's athletes were mistakenly introduced as the ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"" - the official name of North Korea. The South Sudanese team went on to beat Puerto Rico by 90 points to 79. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a protracted conflict, and qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time last year.

827,Olympic chiefs 'sorry' opening ceremony caused offence,"A banquet sequence during the Paris 2024 opening ceremony, which included a depiction of Greek god Dionysus, has been criticised Olympic Games organisers have said they are ""sorry"" that scenes in Friday's opening ceremony caused offence. A banquet sequence featuring drag artists in particular came in for criticism from Christian groups, who felt it parodied Leonardo da Vinci's painting 'The Last Supper'. That famous 15th Century work depicts a key biblical scene. The Catholic Church in France was among critics, saying the ceremony featured ""scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity"". A US telecommunications company, C Spire, said it would be pulling its advertising around the Olympic Games after being ""shocked by the mockery of the Last Supper during the opening ceremonies"". The ceremony's artistic director, Thomas Jolly, said there was no intention to ""mock or denigrate anyone"" and explained the scene in question was designed to reference pagan gods. ""Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,"" Paris 2024 spokeswoman Anne Descamps told reporters on Sunday. ""On the contrary, I think Thomas Jolly did try to intend to celebrate community tolerance. We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offence, we of course are really sorry."" Jolly told French broadcaster BFM: ""The idea was to do a big pagan party linked to the gods of Olympus. ""You'll never find in my work any desire to mock or denigrate anyone. I wanted a ceremony that brings people together, that reconciles, but also a ceremony that affirms our Republican values of liberty, equality and fraternity.""

824,The Palestinians heading to Paris to represent their people,"As she put in some last practice lengths in Paris last week, Palestinian-American swimmer Valerie Tarazi thought back to her moment of inspiration: watching the legendary Michael Phelps winning eight golds in Beijing in 2008. “That was like my first like, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to be an Olympian’,” she said. Paris is a dream come true, as it is for countless athletes taking to sport’s biggest stage. But after more than nine months of war in Gaza and the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, Tarazi says her participation is also an act of commemoration. “It’s me honouring them,” she said. A child of the huge Palestinian diaspora, Tarazi, who swims in the 200m individual medley next Friday, was born and raised in the US. But she celebrates her connections to one of Gaza’s oldest Christian families. She says four members of her extended family were killed when a church was hit during intense Israeli bombing last December. “It takes a toll on us,” she said of Gaza’s rising death toll, which is now approaching 40,000. “This is our friends, our family, our teammates or national team members,” she said. The International Olympic Committee has recognised the state of Palestine since 1995. Three quarters of UN members also now recognise Palestine, but the US, Britain and the host of this year’s games do not. Despite her punishing training schedule and the sacrifices needed to compete at this level, Tarazi is acutely aware that she is in a uniquely privileged position, offered the chance to carry the flag in the world’s greatest sporting jamboree. “My little bit of pain is absolutely nothing compared to what they have to go through every single day,” she said of her compatriots back home. One of her less fortunate teammates, Tamer Qaoud, is having a hard time keeping his own sporting ambitions alive. His house in Gaza has been destroyed. He and his family have been forced to move twice during the war. They’re now living in a tent in Deir el-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. “My dream was to reach the Olympics,” he told the BBC this week. “Unfortunately, due to the war and circumstances, we couldn’t leave Gaza.” Qaoud, a 1500 metre runner, has already represented his country twice. A year ago, at the Arab Games in Algiers, he wore running spikes for the first time. It was also the first time he’d ever run on anything other than concrete. In September, he joined Tarazi at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, in China. They were still there when war broke out in Gaza in early October. Qaoud says he had to go home. His best time is well outside the Olympic qualifying mark, but any faint chance he might have had of competing in Paris, even on a wild card, quickly vanished. “I wanted to compete with the world's best athletes, like Jakob,” he said, referring to the current men’s 1500 world champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen. “I wanted to run alongside him, to feel what it's like to compete with the world's best.” Amid the tents, the dust and the date palms of Deir el-Balah, he still trains, wearing his white Palestinian uniform, watched by small groups of bewildered children. His old training ground, Gaza City’s Yarmouk Stadium, is a waste ground of rubbish and displaced Palestinian families, seeking shelter amid the stands. And his coach, Bilal Abu Samaan, was killed in an Israeli airstrike last December, one of an estimated 182 athletes and sports officials killed since last October, according to the Palestinian Football Association. Qaoud knows his time has not yet come. Unless he can get out of Gaza, he fears it never will. “The war destroyed everything, shattering our dreams,” he said. “I hope to leave Gaza, join a training camp, regain my old strength and come back stronger than before.” Back in the pool in Paris, another Palestinian swimmer, Yazan al-Bawwab, said he was proud to be an ambassador for a place where just playing sport is a challenge. “We don’t have a pool in Palestine,” he said. “We don’t have infrastructure.” Like Tarazi, al-Bawwab was born and raised abroad, but he wears his uniform, and his identity, with fierce pride. “France does not recognise Palestine as a country,” al-Bawwab said defiantly, repeating the sentence for emphasis. “I’m here, raising the flag.”",2024-07-28 23:10:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz475vdd97qo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
822,Top five stories from day two of Paris Olympics 2024,"Kimberley Woods won Team GB's third medal of Paris 2024 in canoe slalom Adam Peaty was narrowly denied a third successive gold medal after Andy Murray and Dan Evans produced one of Britain's great Olympic comebacks on day two of Paris 2024. On a star-studded day in the French capital, Peaty had to settle for silver in the men's 100m breaststroke after Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi beat him by 0.02 seconds. Earlier, Murray extended his stellar career with a dramatic tie-break win in the men's tennis doubles alongside Dan Evans, against Japanese opponents Kei Nishikori and Taro Daniel. Celebrities came out on Sunday morning to see Simone Biles, one of the most decorated gymnasts in history, make her much-anticipated Olympics return. Elsewhere, Kimberley Woods earned Team GB's third medal of the Games in spectacular style, with bronze in the canoe slalom. There were early exits for Team GB to contend with, but rower Helen Glover, who was a flagbearer alongside Tom Daley, made a positive start to her quest for a third Olympic gold. In the morning, a planned triathlon training session had to be cancelled due to pollution in the River Seine. There were boos as Dutch volleyball player Steven van der Velde began his Olympic campaign. He was jailed in 2016 for raping a 12-year-old British girl.

To be at the Games in Paris is an achievement in itself - to come within two-hundredths of a second of a third straight gold was remarkable. Peaty was pipped at the post in a dramatic final, with Martinenghi taking a surprise gold. The Brit finished in a dead heat with American Nic Fink - both men will take home a silver medal. Earlier in the night, the Parisian crowd was sent into ecstasy as France's Leon Marchand set a new Olympic record - and narrowly missed breaking his own world record - in the men's 400m medley. GB's Max Litchfield finished fourth in that event - the third successive Olympics in which he has finished just outside the medals. Litchfield's compatriots Duncan Scott and Matthew Richards both made the final of the men's 200m freestyle, while Oliver Morgan also progressed from the semi-finals in the 100m backstroke. Andy Murray (left) and Dan Evans have progressed to the second round of the doubles Murray has never done anything easily in his extraordinary career - and he is not going to start now. He and Evans lost the first set of their first-round match to Daniel and Nishikori of Japan, before winning a tie-break in the second to set up a first to 10 championship tie-break shoot-out in the decider. Murray is playing in his final tournament before retirement, and his farewell tour seemed to be ending as the Japanese duo led 9-4 in that third set - giving them five match points. Yet the Britons somehow fought back, winning seven successive points to triumph 11-9 in the tie-break and reach the second round - sparking wild celebrations. This video can not be played 'Who writes his scripts?' - Murray and Evans come from five match points down to win It had looked at one stage as if Murray's farewell would end before it began, as Evans took a nasty tumble in his opening singles match. Evans' right knee was bleeding and he looked to be struggling with his wrist after hitting the clay during his tie against Tunisia's Moez Echargui. Fortunately for both Evans and Murray, the Briton recovered to win in three sets - 6-2 4-6 6-2 - and was fit enough for the doubles. Elsewhere at Roland Garros, Rafael Nadal won his opening singles match to set up a mouth-watering second-round encounter with Novak Djokovic. And just a couple of hours before his first-round tie, British number two Cameron Norrie withdrew from the men's singles because of injury. This video can not be played Kimberley Woods takes kayak bronze Four years ago, Woods spoke to BBC Sport about her experiences of depression and self-harm, which she linked to being severely bullied as a child. Sport has been her escape, and she won a brilliant bronze in the women's kayak discipline of canoe slalom for Team GB, with a time of 98.94 seconds. In a dramatic final, Woods was holding on to third place in the standings with only reigning Olympic champion Ricarda Funk to run. But when Germany's Funk clipped a gate and picked up a 50-second penalty, the bronze was secured for 28-year-old Woods and Team GB. Gold went to Australia's Jessica Fox, who only qualified sixth fastest for the final but produced a near-perfect run when it counted. This video can not be played Simone Biles' best bits After her struggles three years ago at the Tokyo Games, Biles made a dazzling Olympic return with a stunning beam routine in gymnastics qualifying. There were concerns over the four-time Olympic champion as, after producing another impressive performance on the floor, she appeared to be limping. The 27-year-old came back out for the vault with heavy strapping to her left ankle but came through that routine - and the final apparatus - unscathed and finished top of the all-around standings with three sub-divisions to go. US coach Cecile Landi later told reporters Biles had ""just a little pain in her calf"". Rapper Snoop Dogg, who is part of the coverage team for American broadcaster NBC, and singer Ariana Grande were at the Bercy Arena to cheer on their compatriot, as was film star Tom Cruise who delighted fans by posing for pictures. It was a good day for the British gymasts too, as the women qualified for the team final on Tuesday. This video can not be played Heartbroken Giles speaks to the BBC British judoka Chelsie Giles won bronze at Tokyo and had a bye to the second round in Paris, but she was left in tears as she suffered a surprise exit after a golden score defeat by Brazil's Larissa Pimenta. There was also disappointment in the boxing for Rosie Eccles as she fell at the first hurdle, suffering a split-decision loss to Poland's Aneta Rygielska, and for Patrick Brown who was beaten in the roundof 16 by Brazil's Keno Machado. In the afternoon, Britain's Evie Richards took fifth in the women's mountain biking as home hero Pauline Ferrand-Prevot won gold for France. There was equestrian controversy too, as Great Britain's huge lead in the team eventing standings was reduced by a jumping penalty against Ros Canter.

815,Parisians’ Olympic spirit not dampened – but grumbles remain,"Ahead of the Olympics, some Parisians were grumbling. Security issues and overcrowding had been among locals' top concerns in the preceding weeks, which were also an immensely turbulent period in the country’s politics. Making matters worse was Friday’s wave of co-ordinated arson attacks on the French railway network that ruined the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of people.  But a vibrant opening ceremony and an early flurry of French medals have started to make many in the city optimistic.  And as the rain clouds clear, some of the city's residents say the sport is starting to bring France some much-needed togetherness. The morning after France snatched its first gold of the Games, the sun finally shone on a fan zone in the city’s 13th arrondissement, where couples and families lounged in deckchairs, watching a big screen. A man named Max was jubilant after the French victory in the men’s rugby sevens. “I was very proud,” he said. “But I was always excited about the Olympics, even if some people are not.” The tone of the sporting extravaganza so far was perhaps set by Friday’s ambitious opening ceremony, which seemed to surprise many locals in its smooth execution.  Director Thomas Jolly appeared to pre-empt the possibility of something going wrong, as one of the pre-filmed inserts showed torchbearer Zinedine Zidane on a broken-down metro train. “I’m pretty sure that everybody who saw the ceremony changed their minds,” said Pierre, a cyclist who had been annoyed beforehand by the vast security lockdown. “I was not very optimistic about the Olympics. I have to say that I was a little bit grumpy,” said a rugby fan named Vincent. “But now I find the ambience very cool.” Spirits were undampened as the downpours that characterised the ceremony continued into the weekend. Cheers and spontaneous renditions of French national anthem La Marseillaise broke out from crowds who lined the streets to watch cyclists braving treacherous conditions in the time-trial competitions. Curious locals perched on their upper-floor window ledges, or balanced themselves precariously on street furniture to get a good view. Police officers could not resist taking photos. Even delivery cyclists, evidently perplexed by the many road closures, paused to drink in the action. For ice-cream seller Ludwig, who had set up stall on the Boulevard Saint-Germain as the competitors whizzed past, sales were faltering in the wet weather, but all that mattered was the “beautiful atmosphere” that the global sporting contest had brought. And as French athletes notched up some early sporting successes, it started to look like the feelgood factor might last beyond the opening ceremony. Pedestrians poked their heads into bars to watch TV screens and applaud as some of the first medals rolled in. The Games were proving an “incredible” display of French culture and togetherness, said two judo fans who had dressed up as beloved comic characters Asterix and Obelix. Speaking outside the Champ de Mars Arena, Thomas-Felix and Sebastien said it was disappointing that that French competitor Luka Mkheidze was defeated in the final of the men’s 60kg contest, but at least they were surrounded by plenty of compatriots and could “all cry together”. Some Parisians are pleased to see something other than politics starting to fill the headlines. For Caroline Loire, who is organising street theatre during the Games, the sport represents ""a break"". A matter of weeks ago, a hastily-formed left-wing coalition triumphed in the second round of the snap parliamentary election - after the far-right National Rally topped the polls in the first vote. France is now in the hands of a caretaker government, its future uncertain. “[President] Macron wants us to forget all about the politics, but we won’t,” said Adrienne, an arts student who was excited to watch the Olympic table-tennis. “We will appreciate the sportsmen and sportswomen - but we won’t forget.” Another man, Alexandre, was doubtful that the Games would have a long-term galvanising impact, but felt it was a good chance for France to “show what it can do”. That was important, he said, in light of Friday’s attack on the railways. “It’s a heavy situation,” he lamented. Even if the Games do manage to distract many people for a time, the enthusiasm is far from universal. “I’m not excited. I don’t think Paris is the right place for it,” said a student, Melissa, who suggested another city would have been better equipped to deal with the crowds. There have been fears that the Parisian infrastructure could groan under the strain of so many visitors, but some of the most central streets and even its metro stations have felt eerily quiet - perhaps as a result of many locals abandoning the city for the summer. On Saturday, some barriers remained on the Île Saint-Louis, an island in the Seine that was cordoned off for the opening ceremony. Footfall seemed relatively low. Some businesses that were open said it remained to be seen whether an influx of Olympic tourists would make up for the lost trade. The Games were good news for France, but “not good for business"", said one restaurateur, gesturing at a row of empty tables. Further south, spectators and Games delegates were starting to seek out the bars and cafes of the Latin Quarter – although one Greek outlet named Olympie was conspicuously closed. “I don’t care that the Olympics is in Paris,” said one bistro-owner, Jean-Louis, who was hustling for passing customers. “This is just a view of France, but it’s not reality,” he said of the Games. He said poverty was a more important issue for millions of people. After all, he said, “the Olympic Games don’t give me something to eat”.",2024-07-28 23:10:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckmg3lyd14do,Unknown,Unknown,,True
821,Convicted child rapist Van de Velde booed on Olympic debut,"This video can not be played Convicted rapist Van de Velde receives mixed reception in Olympics debut Convicted child rapist Steven van de Velde made his Olympic beach volleyball debut to a mixed reaction in Paris, with audible boos. Van de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after admitting three counts of rape against a 12-year-old British girl. He and volleyball partner Matthew Immers are ranked 10th in the world but lost 2-1 to Italy's Alex Ranghieri and Adrian Carambula, ranked 25th, at the Eiffel Tower Stadium. The pair were introduced to the crowd together, with cheers as well as some boos as they walked out. There were boos, along with applause, when Van de Velde was individually announced to the crowd before the match began. All players shook hands before and after the match. The Dutch pair are next in action on 31 July, when they face Chile's Marco and Esteban Grimalt at 15:00 BST.  Steven van de Velde is competing in the beach volleyball at the Paris Games An online petition calling for 29-year-old Van de Velde to be banned from the Olympics had received 90,000 signatures before he played his first match. His inclusion in the Dutch team has been criticised by women's and safeguarding groups. Fans speaking to BBC Sport before the match also felt he should not be competing. One British fan said: ""He's been open and honest about it and he's served his time, but personally, I think they could have made a different choice.  ""They could have chosen someone else, avoided all the controversy and if it was a British person, I wouldn't be happy they would be in our team."" Another said that Van de Velde's inclusion ""does not represent the spirt of the Olympics"", while one German fan, when told by BBC Sport about the story, said: ""I am very astonished. He should not be allowed to play."" However, one Dutch fan said it was ""right"" Van de Velde was competing, adding: ""He's been punished and now it's over and he can continue with his life like anyone else."" His playing partner Immers, speaking after the match, also said he thought it was right that Van de Velde could compete. ""We talked about it one time and we want to enjoy every moment on this stage because we gave everything together for the past three years to qualify,"" he said. ""Steven is a really nice guy and for me, I played two years with him, there was nothing and now there is some people that don't like it because it is a big tournament."" Van de Velde is not staying in the Olympic village and will not do any post-match media. There was extra security around him when he arrived in Paris with the rest of the team. In previous interviews with Dutch media, Van de Velde said: ""I can't reverse it, so I will have to bear the consequences. It has been the biggest mistake of my life."" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said the selection of athletes for the Games was the responsibility of individual committees. Van de Velde returned to playing in 2017. The Dutch Olympic Committee (NOC) said he had met guidelines set by the Dutch Volleyball Federation (NeVoBo) for athletes to resume competing after conviction. The NOC said Van de Velde had returned to the playing arena ""following a specialist treatment programme"". It added: ""Van de Velde has fully engaged with all requirements and has met all the stringent risk assessment thresholds, checks and due diligence. Experts have stated that there is no risk of recidivism. ""Van de Velde has consistently remained transparent about the case which he refers to as the most significant misstep of his life. He deeply regrets the consequences of his actions for those involved."" In a statement to BBC Sport, it also said: ""After his release, Van de Velde sought and received professional counselling. He demonstrated to those around him - privately and professionally - self-insight and reflection."" Mark Adams, spokesperson for the IOC, was asked on Saturday if the organisation was ""comfortable"" with Van de Velde's inclusion. ""To characterise it as comfortable and happy would not be correct,"" Adams said. ""We feel the NOC have explained their decision.  ""Comfortable and happy, characterise it how you want, but the statement that they have given to us is correct and we will continue with the situation as it is."" BBC Sports News Correspondent Laura Scott at the Eiffel Tower Stadium Rarely does an athlete's selection for the Olympics or presence at a Games draw as much controversy as that of Van de Velde.  It has made a lot of people uncomfortable, but ultimately he is here because the NOC picked him and the International Olympic Committee - despite pressure including from safeguarding campaign groups - said the nomination of athletes was the sole responsibility of the respective NOCs. On the way in, I stopped several fans to ask them for their views.  Some were not aware of the story, but we spoke to fans from Germany, the UK and Ireland who felt very strongly that he shouldn't be here and said they wouldn't be supporting him. It was interesting that every Dutch fan I spoke to was either unwilling to talk about the subject or was supportive of Van de Velde.

839,Great Britain's Woods wins Olympic kayak single bronze,"This video can not be played Kimberley Woods takes kayak bronze Great Britain’s Kimberley Woods clinched Olympic bronze in a dramatic women’s kayak single (K1) final at the Vaires-Sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. The 28-year-old qualified third-fastest with an impressive semi-final performance and produced another clean run in the final, clocking 98.94 seconds to earn her first Olympic medal. Woods, third from last to start, moved into second behind Australia's gold medal winner Jessica Fox but was pushed down into bronze by Poland’s Klaudia Zwolinska. With Woods’ fate in the hands of Germany’s reigning champion Ricarda Funk, the Tokyo gold medallist made a major mistake, receiving a 50-second penalty for missing the 20th gate of 23 to miss out on the podium. Woods celebrated with her team after her medal was confirmed, three years after her Olympic debut ended in tears as her final run fell apart and she finished last. With redemption achieved, she will now target gold in kayak cross next week - a discipline making its Olympic debut in Paris and in which she is the reigning world champion. Top five stories from day two of Paris Olympics 2024 Who are Team GB's medal winners at Paris 2024? Woods emulated Helen Reeves, winner of bronze in Athens 20 years ago, as only the second British woman to make a K1 podium at an Olympic Games. Commentating for BBC TV, Reeves said: ""What a way to start for Woods! She is like a different paddler. She has paddled brilliantly and upped her game throughout, run-on-run. ""I felt really confident coming out of the heats for her. All of the work they have been doing has all come together and it is very well deserved."" Australian Fox only qualified eighth fastest for the final but appeared the gold medallist in waiting after crossing the line in 96.08secs, a time which remained unbeaten ahead of Zwolinska (97.53). Kimberley Woods won bronze after a dramatic final run Woods’ Olympic medal is a fitting reward for an athlete who has displayed extraordinary resilience throughout her life, overcoming adversity and repeated setbacks in pursuit of medals in an unforgiving sport, where the biggest prizes are settled by the finest margins. In Tokyo she was consoled by team-mates by the side of the course after a missed gate contributed to 56 penalty seconds. But here, at a raucous canoe slalom venue in front of an energetic crowd, misfortune befell Funk to ensure Woods' perfect run - celebrated with a beaming smile as she launched her paddle into the water - earned her bronze. Before Tokyo, Woods revealed she had overcome years of childhood bullying, depression and self harm to reach her first Games. Little over a month after those Games, Woods was involved in a car accident which left her in a wheelchair one week before the 2021 World Championships. Not only did she compete in Slovakia, but Woods left with women's K1 bronze – her first individual world medal. It was last year that Woods truly established herself as gold-medal contender in Paris, winning her first global title in kayak cross, along with canoe single (C1) silver behind team-mate Mallory Franklin. And so, this time, with the confidence provided by world gold and the experience of a first Games to call upon, Woods delivered the moment she had long dreamed of before celebrating an emotional success with family and friends under the Paris sun. ""That whole journey of where I've come from in the last 10 years, it's been incredible and I'm really proud of who I am today, and be able to be open and speak about it and use my platform for good,"" said Woods. ""It just makes everything worth it. I think the journey I've been on, that first moment of admitting that I do need help, I think that's kind of where I go back to. It's OK to do that.

The first of what the rising star hopes will be four individual golds in Paris was secured by a margin of 5.67 seconds over Japan's Tomoyuki Matsushita in second, with the USA's Carson Foster third at the La Defense Arena. Great Britain's Max Litchfield finished fourth in the event for a third Olympics in a row, but set a new British record of four minutes 8.85 seconds. Marchand, 22, has been one of the poster boys in the build-up to these Games and was roared home by the partisan crowd. He finished just outside his own world record time but beat the Olympic best, previously set by American great Michael Phelps at the Beijing Games in 2008. Marchand is coached in the US by Phelps' former mentor Bob Bowman, having sent a letter to the 59-year-old American prior to the last Olympics asking for help, while Phelps was in the arena to witness the win.

Peaty, 29, was well placed with 25m to go but was pipped by 0.02 seconds and finished in a tie for second with American Nic Fink. The Briton was bidding to become only the second man, after the great American Michael Phelps, to win the same swimming event at three consecutive Olympics. Silver still caps a remarkable achievement for Peaty who took a break from the sport after issues with alcohol and his mental health since his last gold in Tokyo. ""I am not crying because I have come second. I am crying because of how much it took to get here,"" Peaty told the BBC. ""In my heart I have won. These are happy tears.""

After returning last autumn, he won bronze at this year's World Championships and qualified fastest for this final ahead of China's Qin Haiyang. Qin, the 2023 world champion who was expected to be Peaty's main rival for gold, led the Briton by 0.05 seconds at the turn before fading. Peaty moved into the lead halfway down the final length before Martinenghi, the bronze medallist from Tokyo, came through in the final strokes with Peaty and Fink touching the wall at exactly the same time. Peaty became emotional afterwards as he spoke about his difficult recent years and there were more tears after the medal ceremony when he hugged his three-year-old son.

836,Priestman 'heartbroken' by drone scandal as funding pulled,"Canada head coach Bev Priestman stepped down from her Olympic duties before being banned for 12 months by Fifa Canada women's football head coach Bev Priestman says she is ""absolutely heartbroken for the players"" after a drone scandal left the Olympic champions' title defence in jeopardy. The team have been docked six points at Paris 2024 and Priestman received a one-year football ban from world governing body Fifa. Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) officials Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander have also been suspended from all football activities for a year. They were sanctioned after a drone was used to spy on a training session held by New Zealand, who are in Canada's group at the Paris Games. ""I am absolutely heartbroken for the players, and I would like to apologise from the bottom of my heart for the impact this situation has had on all of them,"" said Priestman in a statement on Sunday. ""I know how hard they have worked following a very difficult year in 2023, and that they are a group of people who care very much about sportsmanship and integrity."" The English-born coach, referencing an ongoing CSA investigation, said: ""As the leader of the team on the field, I want to take accountability, and I plan to fully co-operate with the investigation."" She also urged the Canadian public to continue to support the players. Canada deducted points and coach banned over drone Canada used drones before and Tokyo gold could be 'tarnished' Priestman removed as Olympic boss over drone incident Earlier on Sunday, Canada's government said it will withhold funding for the women's football officials who were banned by Fifa. Carla Qualtrough, the country's sports minister, said the move to send a drone to monitor New Zealand's training session was ""cheating"". She described the issue as ""deeply regrettable"" and said it was causing ""significant distraction and embarrassment for Team Canada and all Canadians"". ""It is completely unfair to Canadian players and to opposing teams. It undermines the integrity of the game itself,"" Qualtrough added. ""Given that the women's programme receives funding from Sport Canada, we are withholding funding relating to suspended Canada Soccer officials for the duration of their Fifa sanction."" Sport Canada is the government-led body that helps to fund elite level national organisations. Canadian Olympic Committee chief executive David Shoemaker said on Friday there appeared to be ""information that could tarnish"" the team's women's football gold medal from the Tokyo Games. It followed Canadian media reports that drones had been used at previous tournaments. Qualtrough added: ""There is a deeply concerning pattern of behaviour at Canada Soccer. ""We must, and will, get to the bottom of this. The government of Canada will closely monitor the investigation and outcomes of the Canada Soccer process that is under way. ""The Future of Sport in Canada Commission is also under way which will make recommendations to the government on improvements to the Canadian sport system."" However, Priestman said in her statement the ""winning of the gold medal was earned through sheer grit and determination, despite reports to the contrary"". Canada, led by assistant coach Andy Spence in Priestman's absence, have beaten New Zealand and hosts France in their opening two games in Group A. A 2-1 win against France on Sunday evening means they sit third in the group table on zero points but victory over Colombia in their final group game would secure qualification for the quarter-finals. Vanessa Gilles scored the winner 12 minutes into second-half stoppage time for Canada as they defeated the hosts in Saint-Etienne, keeping hopes of making progress alive.

843,Biden criticises 'extreme' Supreme Court in push for reform,"Joe Biden has criticised the ""extreme opinions"" of the Supreme court as he proposed sweeping reforms including the removal of life appointments. The proposals come after the current conservative-dominated court issued a series of major decisions, including upending the constitutional right to abortion and allowing presidents wide-ranging immunity from prosecution for ""official acts"". Mr Biden has proposed an 18-year term for justices and an enforcable ethics code ""to restore trust and accountability"". He however faces a difficult task to gain Congressional approval given Republican control of the House of Representatives. Democrats hope that pushing for reform can help galvanise voters before November's election.  At the same time, it has been dogged by allegations of judicial ethics violations, particularly after journalists investigated Justice Clarence Thomas for not reporting gift. The court's nine justices serve for life under current rules, and new appointments are made by the sitting president when a member retires or dies. Donald Trump appointed three justices in his four years in office. In a speech on Monday in Austin, Texas, Mr Biden said that the ""extreme opinions"" handed down by the court ""have undermined law and established civil rights principles and protections"". The president added that the court was ""mired in a crisis of ethics"", citing conflicts of interests among justices.  ""I'm certain we need these reforms to restore trust in the court, preserve the system of checks and balances that are vital to our democracy,"" he said. The speech marked the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.  In an article published earlier in the day in the Washington Post, Mr  Biden said that ""what is happening now is not normal"".  ""It undermines the public's confidence in the court's decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms,"" he wrote. ""We now stand in a breach.""  Mr Biden has proposed a new justice is appointed to the court every two years, who would then serve for 18 years. Reform advocates have previously suggested that such a staggered system would help depoliticise the court. The president also want Congress to establish a new code of ethics that would force justices to disclose gifts and avoid overt political activities.  While the court released a code of ethics for the first time in its history last year, the it has no enforcement mechanism. Lastly, Mr Biden hopes to pass an amendment to the US constitution that would reverse a 1 July ruling in which the Supreme Court said that Donald Trump and other former presidents are immune from criminal prosecution.  In the controversial ruling, the court's justices found that a president has immunity for ""official acts"" but is not immune from ""unofficial acts"".  In his article, Mr Biden said that the proposed amendment - which he has dubbed ""No One is Above the Law"" - would ""make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office"".  ""I share our founders' belief that the president's power is limited, not absolute,"" he wrote. ""We are a nation of laws - not of kings or dictators"". Republicans have pushed back on efforts to reform the court.  In a Monday statement, the Trump campaign accused President Biden and vice president - and presumptive Democratic nominee - Kamala Harris of working to ""undermine the legitimacy"" of the court.  ""It's all part of Kamala's scheme to pack the Supreme Court with far-left, radical judges who will render decisions based on politics, now the law,"" the Trump statement said.  On Sunday, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Democrats made no effort to do so when a more liberal-leaning group of justices were ""pumping out opinions they liked.""   Earlier this month, Trump also described efforts to reform the court as an ""illegal"" and ""unconstitutional"" attack on the ""sacred"" institution.  ""The Democrats are attempting to interfere in our presidential election, and destroy our justice system, by attacking their political opponent, me, and our honourable supreme court,"" he wrote.  ""We have to fight for our fair and independent courts, and protect our country.""  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal ""dead on arrival"" in the House. In reply, Mr Biden said Mr Johnson's ""thinking is dead on arrival"". Yet Professor Daniel Urman, who teaches law and public policy at Northeastern University in Boston, described the proposal as ""too little, too late"".  ""Rarely do lame duck presidents secure major legislative victories, and, even if so, Republicans, who are happy with the current Supreme Court, control the House,"" Prof Urman told the BBC. ""The interesting question is what [Vice President] Harris will do on this issue during the campaign,"" he added. ""Court reform is pretty popular, especially term limits.""

855,McSharry wins Ireland's first medal at Paris Olympics,"Mona McSharry was in disbelief after finishing third at the La Defense Arena Mona McSharry has won Ireland's first medal of the Paris Olympics after taking bronze in the women's 100m breaststroke. McSharry finished third in a tight final, which was won by South Africa's Tatjana Smith with Tang Qianting second for China.  The 23-year-old looked in shock as she checked the screen to see where she had finished, as her quiet confidence about securing a medal in Paris became a euphoric reality. ""It's amazing,"" the Sligo swimmer told BBC Sport NI after winning Ireland's first medal in the pool since the Atlanta Games in 1996.  ""It's amazing to be part of a race with such tight competitors. To come out and watch the Irish flag being raised, and to be part of that atmosphere, was unbelievable.  ""It's something I'm never going to forget."" McSharry still looked in disbelief as she stood on the podium some 20 minutes after the conclusion of her race as the Irish flags dominated the Parisian arena.  After stepping off the rostrum, she ran to a group of Irish flags in the corner before taking some time to savour her historic moment. ""You can't really ask for anything more than winning a medal at the Olympics,"" she added. ""I'm not even sure that was really something that little me dreaming of going to the Olympics thought was possible.  ""I've kept pushing and that's what I've been training for all year, to be top three and dreams do come true."" This video can not be played 'Outstanding' McSharry wins women's 100m breaststroke bronze for Ireland In an ultra-tight final, McSharry finished 0.31 seconds off winner Smith and just 0.01 seconds ahead of Italian Benedetta Pilato, who was fourth. McSharry is competing in her second Olympics and, before flying to Paris, had told BBC Sport she was targeting a medal after reaching the final in Tokyo three years ago.  When asked what the little girl who grew up in Sligo would think of her success, McSharry said ""making it to two Olympics was already a pretty big feat for what she had dreamed"". ""To be an Olympic medallist is just one step further and I couldn't be more proud of myself."" McSharry's qualifying times backed up that belief as she qualified for Monday's final as the second fastest swimmer, and her time in the final was only marginally slower than the swim that got her to the showpiece. There were huge cheers in the La Defense Arena from the Irish support throughout the race as the swimmers continue to deliver in the pool. World champion Daniel Wiffen, from Northern Ireland, is one of the favourites to win gold in the men's 800m freestyle final on Tuesday after qualifying fastest in the heats, while Ellen Walshe also reached a first Olympic final earlier on Monday. ""It's really just about racing and getting your hands on the wall first,"" McSharry added. ""I've quite a number of people here supporting which is just amazing. It's hard to spot them all in the crowd but hopefully later we can catch up and just be happy and enjoy this moment.""

854,Man arrested over suspected French railway vandalism,"An “ultra-left militant” was arrested in north-west France on Sunday after being found behaving suspiciously near a railway site, according to police sources quoted by French media. Officers who searched the man’s car found keys to technical premises, pliers, a set of universal keys and literature “linked to the ultra-left"". The 28-year-old suspect is currently being questioned by police in the city of Rouen, French media said. There is no indication that the man has links with the people responsible for Friday's suspected co-ordinated arson attack on railway lines ahead of the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympic Games.  The acts of sabotage paralysed high-speed TGV lines running to and from Paris and heavily disrupted travel in France. On Monday morning, France’s Minister of the Interior Gerald Darmanin said that a “number of profiles of people who could have committed these very deliberate, very targeted acts of sabotage” had been identified. He added that the methods employed were “traditional” of the ultra-left and said there was “likely a political claim” behind the sabotage. ""The question is whether they were manipulated or is it for their own account,"" Mr Darmanin said, adding that investigators were making good progress and would find those responsible.  Although he stopped short of saying the saboteurs had accomplices within France's national rail operator SNCF, Mr Darmanin noted the locations of the arson attacks were “extremely specific” “It was obviously extremely well targeted, it wasn't done randomly, and it affected three major lines,"" he added. Mr Darmanin also said that around 50 people were arrested ahead of the Olympics who, alongside others - thought to number around 150 - had “wanted to carry out either sabotage or radical protests in Paris during the first events of the Olympic Games”. Alongside the damage to the train lines, French media also reported that fiber optic cables were found cut in six locations across France overnight Sunday into Monday, causing some isolated outages.  It is still unclear at this stage whether there are any links between the vandalism on the telecoms installations and the sabotage on the rail network last week, which affected an estimated 250,000 passengers on Friday and hundreds of thousands more over the weekend. No group has yet claimed responsibility for either incident. One security source suggested in French media last week that the arson attacks bore all the hallmarks of the extreme left. Transport minister Patrice Vergriete said on Monday that trains services were back up and running as normal after teams worked around the clock over the weekend to fix the damage. He added that ""considerable means”, including drones and police helicopters, were deployed to strengthen the security of the thousands of kilometres that make up France’s railway network.  Mr Vergriete also said that the acts of sabotage will likely have cost several million euros.",2024-07-29 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c903431qejqo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
852,Olympics commentator axed over sexist remark,"A veteran sports commentator has been sacked from his Olympics role after making a sexist remark about Australian female swimmers following their gold medal win.  As the 4x100m freestyle relay team were making their way off the pool deck in Paris, Bob Ballard said they were ""finishing up"", adding ""you know what women are like... hanging around, doing their make-up"".  The clip quickly went viral and broadcaster Eurosport later said he had been removed from the commentary line-up.  Ballard apologised if the remarks caused offence and said it was not his ""intention to upset or belittle anyone"", in a statement posted to X.  Mollie O’Callaghan, Emma McKeon, Meg Harris and Shayna Jack had just beaten the US and China, to make it the fourth Olympics in a row where Australia has claimed the gold medal in the event. They were waving to crowds and celebrating the achievement when Ballard made his comments.  His co-commentator and British swimming champion Lizzie Simmonds had immediately branded his remark ""outrageous"", prompting laughter from Ballard. In his statement on X, Ballard urged users not to ""pile in on"" Simmonds. Some had been quick to attack the ex-Olympic swimmer online.  On Sunday, Eurosport said Ballard - previously a long-time BBC reporter and presenter - would not return to their airwaves.  ""During a segment of Eurosport’s coverage last night, commentator Bob Ballard made an inappropriate comment,"" the broadcaster said in a statement. ""To that end, he has been removed from our commentary roster with immediate effect."" Mr Ballard has been a stalwart of global sports coverage since the 1980s, reporting on many Olympic games and World Championships. He has commentated on an array of sports including water polo, ice hockey and wheelchair tennis, but is best known for his coverage of swimming and diving.

GB took the lead in the first half through Ellie Boatman's try in the right corner, which was well converted by Lisa Thomson from the touchline. But the British team failed to press their advantage with several passes going astray before Naya Tapper struck back for the Americans to make it 7-5 at half-time. And the USA raised their game after the break with tries from Kirsti Krishe and Sammy Sullivan ensuring they progress to Tuesday's semi-finals. GB meanwhile will go into the 5th-8th place play-off bracket, having finished fourth at each of the previous two Olympics. It completes a bad day for the team, after British Olympic Association said it is investigating an alleged racist message sent by player Amy Wilson-Hardy. Elsewhere in women's rugby sevens, reigning champions New Zealand progressed to the last four after running in nine tries during a 57-5 thumping of China. They will take on USA in the last four. Hosts France meanwhile were stunned 19-14 by Canada, who scored a last-minute winning try through Chloe Daniels. The French women had hoped to emulate the men's rugby sevens team, who claimed gold on the opening day of the Games, but a forward pass during the final play of the game left the team devastated.

870,Peaty tests positive for Covid after winning silver,"This video can not be played GB's Adam Peaty narrowly misses out on 100m breaststroke gold Adam Peaty has tested positive for Covid-19 a day after winning silver for Team GB in the 100m breaststroke at the Paris Olympics. Peaty missed out on a third consecutive gold medal by 0.02 seconds on Sunday and afterwards said he had been slightly unwell with “a little bit on my throat”. A Team GB statement said the 29-year-old’s condition worsened overnight and he has now tested positive for coronavirus. Unlike the last Games in Tokyo, there are no strict protocols around the disease in Paris which could prevent him from competing. It is viewed as a general illness by organisers, although Team GB have straightforward protocols including hand hygiene and keeping space from other competitors. Peaty was expected be part of the British relay teams later in the Olympics, with a possible return to action as soon as Friday. Team GB said he is “hopeful to be back in competition”. “As in any case of illness, the situation is being managed appropriately, with all usual precautions being taken to keep the wider delegation healthy,” the statement added. This video can not be played 'In my heart I've already won' - Peaty reacts to silver medal Peaty could compete in either the men's or mixed 4x100m medley relay competitions in Paris, and was part of the squad that won gold in the mixed event in Tokyo. Their title defence begins on Friday morning in the heats with a potential final, should Britain qualify, on Saturday evening. The men's medley relay begins on Saturday morning, with the heats on Sunday night. Following his positive Covid test, Peaty said: ""I’ll now be focusing on a fast, full recovery to give my best in the team relays later in the week. ""I’ve had so many messages and I’ll get back to you all, thank you for your support as it has truly been an unforgettable journey."" The Team GB coaches would pick Peaty for whichever event they viewed as the best chance of a medal, possibly both if he felt fit enough, and he would be crucial to their hopes. There are other breaststrokers in the GB squad who could take his place if required. Peaty was targeting a third consecutive 100m Olympic title on Sunday, which would have meant he joined Michael Phelps as the only man to have won the same Olympic swimming event three times in a row. He was well placed in the final 25m but Italian Nicolo Martinenghi came through to win gold. Peaty gave emotional interviews afterwards when he discussed his difficulties since his last gold in Tokyo, which included problems with alcohol and his mental health.  He almost walked away from the sport before returning last year. The Englishman is not the first aquatics athlete at these Games to test positive for Covid-19.  Five members of Australia's water polo squad, which takes place at a different venue to the swimming, contracted the disease days before the Games.

869,'You can never dream too big' - GB win first Paris gold in team eventing,"This video can not be played Eventing team win GB's first Gold in Paris Games Team GB retained their Olympic team eventing title to win a first gold medal at the Paris 2024 Games, before Laura Collett claimed individual bronze. Tokyo 2020 champions Collett and Tom McEwen, joined by world number one Ros Canter, sealed victory in Monday's final showjumping stage at Chateau de Versailles. Team GB ended the three-day team competition with 91.30 penalties to finish a commanding 12.3 clear of host nation France, while Japan took bronze. Collett returned with a penalty-free performance to clinch her second medal of the day in the jumping final, finishing behind German gold medallist Michael Jung and Australia’s Christopher Burton, as McEwen finished fourth. The team eventing triumph in Tokyo was GB's first for 49 years, as Collett - once again riding London 52 in Paris - and McEwen were joined by Oliver Townend, with Canter a travelling reserve on that occasion. Three years after that success the team successfully retained their Olympic title for the first time since achieving back-to-back golds in 1972. The British celebrations did not end there, as Collett, who nearly died in a fall in 2013, produced a faultless performance to become the first British woman to win an individual eventing medal since Kristina Cook in 2008. “I never thought this day would come,” Collett told BBC Sport. “I owe absolutely everything to that horse. The team have made it possible. I just want to say thank you to every one of them. “It’s so many years of hard work, blood, sweat and tears. Emotional rollercoaster doesn’t do it justice. “Moments like this make it worth it. You can never dream too big.” Collett, McEwan and Canter topped the standings heading into Monday’s jumping finale but had seen their lead drastically reduced in the cross-country discipline, following a record-breaking dressage performance. Canter had already seen her individual medal hopes ended after incurring 15 jumping penalties in Sunday’s cross-country, which caused her to drop from sixth to 24th – eventually placing 21st overall after a clean final jumping round. The controversial ruling against Canter, which British equestrian were confident would be overturned, was upheld after a review - allowing France to cut Great Britain's overnight lead to 4.7 from 7.4. Collett's individual Olympic record display contributed towards a team Olympic record in the dressage on the opening day of competition, but the cross-country result meant GB began the final eventing phase under pressure from the hosts. However, in Monday's medal decider the British team produced a superb finish to celebrate another golden moment, and comfortably in the end. Despite Canter's penalty misfortune, the 38-year-old - who last year became only the fifth rider to win three majors in a single season - kept GB on course for victory, receiving four penalty points in her outing in glorious conditions at a spectacular Olympic venue. Tokyo individual silver medallist McEwen, 33, then executed a superb, clean run to tighten GB's grip on gold, prompting great celebrations from his onlooking team members. And Collett, the final rider of the entire competition, delivered the golden touch - despite 4.8 penalty points - punching the air in delight after completing an outstanding team performance. Collett, 34, spent six days in a coma after sustaining a punctured lung, spine, shoulder and rib fractures, and losing much of her vision in one eye in her fall 11 years ago. She has described London 52 as ""the horse of a lifetime"", and the pairing completed a memorable medal double in Paris - three years after placing ninth together in the individual competition. Collett began the individual final in the bronze medal position, 1.3 penalty points behind Germany's leader Michael Jung and 0.7 off second-placed Australian Christopher Burton. Despite a perfect round, neither Jung or Burton flinched as they held on to their respective gold and silver. That meant McEwen, on JL Dublin, had to settle for fourth, 2.7 penalty points off team-mate Collett in the final podium place. ""I thought Tokyo was special but this is incomparable,"" Collett said. ""It has blown that out the water, going out in front of a crowd like this and feeling like every single person is willing you on. ""This is just a day I will never, ever forget.""

866,Djokovic beats Nadal to keep Olympic dream going,"This video can not be played Djokovic beats Nadal in two sets Novak Djokovic outclassed his long-time rival Rafael Nadal to win their Olympic second-round match and continue his bid to land an elusive gold medal. Serbia's Djokovic, 37, looked on a different level to Nadal for most of a one-sided contest which he won 6-1 6-4 on the Roland Garros clay. Djokovic led 4-0 in the second set to quell the partisan support for the Spaniard, before 38-year-old Nadal fought back to wipe out the double break. But Djokovic, like we have seen him do so many times, stepped on the gas again to break for 5-4 and serve out victory. ""I'm very relieved,"" said Djokovic. ""Everything was going my way, I was 6-1, 4-0 up but I played a sloppy service game and gave him chances."" Nadal, known as the King of Clay, has won 14 French Open titles at the Olympic venue but the aura he carries there was not enough to trouble a man of Djokovic's quality. The pair, who have won 46 Grand Slam singles titles between them, shared an embrace at the net before Djokovic sportingly clapped Nadal off the court. It was the 60th meeting of their enduring rivalry - no two men have ever played each other more. After first meeting in 2006, Djokovic now leads 31-29 in their head to head. ""I never thought back in 2006 that we'd still be playing each other almost 20 years later,"" Djokovic said. Novak Djokovic inflicted just the fifth defeat in 118 singles matches of Rafael Nadal's career at Roland Garros Djokovic has won everything there is to win in men's singles tennis - including 24 Grand Slam titles across the four majors and every ATP Masters event. But the Olympic title is the one which he still has not won - and the one he really craves. The top seed, who had knee surgery eight weeks ago before returning to reach the Wimbledon final, produced arguably his highest level of the season to make the fast start which rocked 2008 gold medallist Nadal. Nadal had a thigh injury heavily strapped again and was a shadow of the player who has won 22 majors. He could not cope with Djokovic's quality until the late resistance. Nadal will return to Roland Garros - where he has a metallic statue paying tribute to his achievements - on Tuesday when he plays for Spain in the men's doubles alongside reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz. What happens after that remains to be seen. Nadal has barely played over the past two seasons because of injuries and hinted last year he could retire at the end of the 2024 season. Although the former world number one has since said he wants to keep playing as long as his body lets him, this could have been the final time he played singles on Court Philippe Chatrier. Whatever happens, there is a strong possibility Djokovic and Nadal will not renew their rivalry ever again on a competitive court. British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski lost in the first round of the men's doubles, going down 4-6 6-3 10-8 to Czech pair Tomas Machac and Adam Pavlasek. Their defeat leaves Andy Murray, who is retiring after the Games, and Dan Evans as the only British representatives in the men's doubles event. Later on Monday Evans, who earned an barely-believable victory alongside Murray on Sunday night, lost 6-1 6-2 to Greek eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round of the singles. ""It wasn't that good from me really, he’s an amazing tennis player and was too good,"" said 34-year-old Evans. ""It was a quick turnaround and it was just too much. But to get a chance to play for Great Britain you shouldn’t be pulling out so that’s why I went out there."" Poland's Iga Swiatek, who is favourite for gold in the women's singles, breezed into the third round with a 6-1 6-1 win over France's Diane Parry. Swiatek, 23, won the French Open title on the Roland Garros clay last month for the third successive year. American second seed Coco Gauff advanced with a 6-1 6-1 win over Argentina's Maria Lourdes Carles, while Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini - who finished runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon recently - won 6-4 6-1 against Poland's Magda Linette. Czech ninth seed Barbora Krejcikova, who beat Paolini to the Wimbledon title, also moved into the last 16, as did Greek seventh seed Maria Sakkari and Germany's Angelique Kerber.

873,Great Britain's Burgess wins canoe slalom silver,"This video can not be played GB's Adam Burgess wins silver in men's canoe slalom Great Britain's Adam Burgess claimed Olympic silver in the men's canoe singles final at the Vaires-Sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. The 32-year-old qualified fourth fastest with a clean semi-final performance and produced another impressive run in the final to win his first Olympic medal. ""This is a moment I’ve dreamed of all my life,"" he told BBC Sport. ""There’s been so many times in races where I’ve not taken my opportunity and where a mistake put me off the podium, or turned into more mistakes. To see me go into first with just a few boats to go was absolutely magic."" Burgess clocked a time of 96.84 seconds, only eclipsed by France’s Nicolas Gestin who crossed the line 5.48 seconds faster to win gold. Slovakia’s Matej Benus clinched bronze, while reigning world champion Benjamin Savsek received a damaging 50-second penalty to finish 11th. Burgess missed out on the podium by an agonising 0.16 seconds at the delayed Tokyo Games and once again fell just short of a global podium when he finished fifth at last year’s World Championships. Since then he has been an advocate of yoga and breathwork as part of his training. He named his build-up to the Games ‘Project Send It’ - determined to finish the final with no regrets following his near miss three years ago. Burgess was visibly stunned after completing his run but knew he was guaranteed a medal when Germany's Sideris Tasiadis failed to better his time. It was GB’s fifth medal of the day and comes after Kimberley Woods won kayak single (K1) bronze on Sunday.

874,Daley wins superb fifth Olympic medal with Williams,"This video can not be played Daley and Williams seal silver Tom Daley won his fifth Olympic medal with a superb silver alongside Noah Williams in the men's synchronised 10m platform in Paris. Daley, 30, effectively retired from the sport after winning gold in the event in Tokyo, but he and Williams, 24, looked calm as he returned to the biggest stage. The pair applied pressure to China's Lian Junjie and Yang Hao - who were ultimately in a class of their own for gold after three world titles in a row - and were comfortable silver medallists after six fine dives. Daley did not compete for two years but was persuaded to come out of retirement when his son Robbie, now aged six, said he wanted to see his 'Papa' dive at an Olympics. Daley's husband Dustin Lance Black, Robbie, their youngest son Phoenix and countless more friends and family were in the Paris Aquatics Centre to give the British pair loud support. ""It's just so special,"" Daley said.  ""Doing it in front of my son who asked me to come back is so special. I now have one of every colour, I've completed the set."" His two sons were wearing t-shirts that read 'That's my Papa' and the first flicker of emotion from Daley came as he blew a kiss to his family from the medal podium. For Williams, whose first experience of diving was watching on TV as a 14-year-old Daley competed at his first Olympics in 2008, this was a first Olympic medal. ""Tom dove amazingly,"" said Williams, who will also compete in the individual competition in the second week of the Games. ""The fact he dove like that, and China were really good as well, helped me to elevate how I normally dive to what I did today."" Team GB now have five medals in Paris - three silvers and two bronzes. Today's Olympics guide Full Paris Olympics schedule BBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule This video can not be played 'Absolute scenes' - Daley and Williams fourth dive In the build-up Daley said he had already achieved his gold medal. Competing again at an Olympics, with his young family able to attend in support - unlike at the coronavirus-impacted Games of 2021 - was enough for him. But still Daley departs, possibly for good this time, with an Olympic silver medal to add to his gold and three bronze medals.  That medal, as with all of the silverware at these Games, includes a piece of the Eiffel Tower in its centre, something Robbie wrote about recently at school. ""He's six years old and I hope he'll remember some of it,"" Daley said. ""He'll be able to touch some of the Eiffel Tower."" Daley and Williams were almost faultless, only beaten by a pair who produced one of best Olympic performances of this Games. After being tied with Canadian pair Rylan Wiens and Nathan Zsombor-Murray after the first two dives, the British duo edged ahead with their third. There were huge roars in the arena after they scored 93.96 with their fourth. Any realistic hopes of gold faded when China responded with 95.88 from their next effort. But that cannot take away the achievement of Daley and Williams, who ended with a huge score of 93.24 to raise the roof when 40 points fewer would have been enough for silver. Daley made his comeback in December last year.  He and Williams have trained together for a total of two months because Daley lives in Los Angeles, with their only practice coming at competitions. Despite the hurdles, they finished the Olympic final with a score of 463.44, with China taking gold with a massive 490.35 and Canada bronze on 422.13. Williams was in tears afterwards as he paid tribute to his former coach, who died after Tokyo.

884,Stephen Nedoroscik is America's pommel horse hero,"The US gymnastics team has a new breakout star - bespectacled, Rubik's Cube- solving 'pommel horse guy' Stephen Nedoroscik.  The 25-year-old gymnast specialises in the pommel horse, which demands strength, rhythm, and precision. When he stepped up to the apparatus on Monday night, for the men's artistic gymnastics team final, he delivered a clutch performance, rousing the crowds watching in the arena and at home. With one 40 second routine, Nedoroscik helped secure the team a bronze medal - its first since 2008 - and became an overnight internet sensation.  Nedoroscik had the final routine in the last rotation of the Olympic final.  His less than one minute on the apparatus was the only thing standing between the US team and a medal.  As he hopped off after scoring 14.866, his fist shot straight into the air and the crowd erupted. He did what he had come to Paris to do.  The internet also took notice of the gymnast from the state of Massachusetts.  Soon, he was being referred to as Mr Pommel Horse. His girlfriend changed her profile on X, formerly Twitter,  to ""Ms Pommel Horse"".  Fans also discovered one of his hobbies: solving Rubik's Cubes. He finished one in less than 10 seconds the day of the competition.  In a interview on Tuesday, Nedoroscik told NBC's The Today Show that solving  the puzzle is ""stress relief"". ""I love to solve it - it's just fun,"" he said. Social media users compared him to Clark Kent, Superman's alter-ego who wears glasses.  Nedoroscik, waiting for his routine, sat on the sidelines in glasses, before taking them off to compete.  ""Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team,"" one user wrote in a viral post.  ""He just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.""  NBC's Olympics X account called him ""the Clark Kent of pommel horse"".  Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, which can cause double vision.  In a 2022 post on TikTok, he showed his followers how his condition allows him to alternate which eye is the dominant eye.  He told The Today Show he thought the memes about him are ""awesome"" and represent ""the people that wear glasses well"".  He was asked how he was able to carry out Monday's routine without his glasses, though he has competed in prescription goggles in the past.  ""It's not necessarily clear,"" he said of his vision. “But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [the glasses] on, they’re going to fly somewhere."".  In the end, he said, it's ""all about feeling the equipment"".  “I don’t even really see when I’m doing my gymnastics. It’s all in the hands. I can feel everything.” Nedoroscik will compete again in the individual event, the men's pommel horse final, on 3 August.

883,Harris hopes to keep Georgia in play with star-studded rally,"Kamala Harris is bringing her newly-minted presidential campaign to Georgia, a state that some Democrats now consider up for grabs in the closely contested election. The vice-president is holding a star-studded campaign rally in Atlanta on Tuesday featuring a performance by pop star Megan Thee Stallion. Democratic Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock will also attend.  The possibility of Democrats winning in the battleground state was a stretch one month ago, but some analysts now believe a new face on top of the ticket and a fresh burst of energy may change everything. Ms Harris replaced Mr Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee after the president announced he was withdrawing from the race.  ""It has been a reset button in so many ways,"" Amy Morton, the CEO of Georgia-based consulting firm Southern Majority, told the BBC. ""It completely changed the landscape of Georgia.""  Swing states like Georgia, which Mr Biden won by the narrowest margin in 2020, are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections. It's a state Republicans are looking to flip back red.  Donald Trump will also be campaigning in Atlanta on Saturday - at the same venue as Ms Harris - to cement his support in the swing state.  Congressman Hank Jackson, a Georgia Democrat, told BBC News an ""explosion of enthusiasm has been unleashed"" since Ms Harris stepped up as the nominee. He pointed to how Ms Harris has been devoted to uplifting different demographics, which resonates specifically among Georgia voters.  ""All demographics are positively activated by her candidacy,"" Mr Jackson said.  Democrats in Georgia depend heavily on strong turnout among black voters, a state with one of the highest African American populations in the country. Polls were suggesting that the state was drifting away from Mr Biden, University of Georgia Professor Charles Bullock told BBC News.  The state is on Ms Harris's ""watch list"", he added, noting she has made more than a dozen visits.  In a campaign strategy memo, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon listed Georgia as one of several Sun Belt states - as well as North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada - where the campaign plans to focus efforts ahead of November.  Before Mr Biden dropped from the race, Ms Morton, a Democratic political consultant in Georgia, said she was concerned about voter turnout, finding many throughout Georgia to be less engaged than when they broke records in 2020.  But now ""that's changed completely"", she says. ""We've gone back into all of our planning to calculate for higher turnout because enthusiasm on the ground is so much more apparent than it was in the beginning of June.""  Ms Morton said she's seen upticks in volunteer signups and social media engagement for down ballot candidates too since Ms Harris entered the race.  Recent polling shows Ms Harris leads Trump by one point - 43% to 42% - among registered voters nationwide, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey.  Ms Morton said she though those margins would only increase, specifically among Georgia voters.  But there is still strong support for Trump in the state. Ms Harris could face attacks over handling the crisis at the southern border as vice-president. Although Georgia is far removed, the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student allegedly killed by a Venezuelan who had entered the US illegally, made the issue of immigration more important to Georgian voters. Mr Bullock said Trump, too, must be careful in his messaging to Georgian voters. His personal attacks on Ms Harris - and not on her policies - could alienate female voters who find him offensive, he said. Trump's allies have attacked Ms Harris’s background, claiming she was a ""DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hire"". Ms Harris could also gain ground in the state by appealing to a significant group of establishment Republican voters who are less sold on Trump. ""There is a share of them - and these would be white college educated voters - who maybe find Trump offensive, they may not have liked the chaos of his administration, they may not like his misogyny,"" Mr Bullock said.",2024-07-30 23:09:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y4zvgv28o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
881,Project 2025 leader quits conservative think tank,"The director of the ultra-conservative Project 2025 has stepped down, saying he will now focus on getting Donald Trump back into the White House. Paul Dans announced he will leave the Heritage Foundation think-tank, which published the document, to ""direct all my efforts to winning, bigly!"" Project 2025 proposes, among other things, hugely expanding the powers of the US president, gutting federal services, restricting access to abortion and large tax cuts. Trump has said he has no connection to the policy document and does not agree with much of its content, which was written by a team including several dozen former members of his administration.  Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage, said that Mr Dans ""built the project from scratch and bravely led this endeavour over the past two years"" but is now ""moving up to the front where the fight remains"".  Mr Roberts said that he would be taking over leadership of the team. A source familiar with the project told the BBC that the project was not shutting down and the change was a reshuffle. Mr Dans said in a statement that he would leave his post as head of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project in August.  ""Electoral season is upon us, and I want to direct all my efforts to winning, bigly!"" he said. ""To everything there is a season."" He said Project 2025's policy platform was always expected to be finalised around the time of the Republican convention earlier this month. ""We completed what we set out to do, which was create a unified conservative vision... united behind the cause of deconstructing the administrative state. ""This tool was built for any administration, dedicated to conservative ideals."" He added that other members of the team would ""continue to put Project 2025 and its recommendations in a place to be of best assistance to the new Conservative Administration, in November"". A Project 2025 advisory board member told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that it would submit work, including a database of potential hires and a list of policy recommendations, to the former president's campaign for review. Mr Dans worked in personnel-related roles in the first Trump administration, including as chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management. At Heritage he organised policy and personnel recommendations and training for appointees in the next presidential administration, according to the think tank's website. Project 2025's defining document - its so-called Mandate for Leadership - has drawn intense media scrutiny and liberal opposition since Trump became the Republican nominee. It is not uncommon for Washington think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting.  However, there is much overlap between Project 2025 and the Republican Party's official platform as well as the rhetoric of some of its most visible figures.  The 922-page document sets out four main policy aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders, and, secure God-given individual rights to live freely. Among its proposals are: In response to Mr Dan's announcement, Trump's campaign reiterated that the former president was ""very clear that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way. ""Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign - it will not end well for you."" Vice-President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic candidate, said that Project 2025 ""isn't going anywhere"". “This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country,"" her campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. “Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real – in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.""",2024-07-30 23:09:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3kx3vgd1o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
875,Biles inspires USA to gymnastics team gold,"This video can not be played 'The best female gymnast that has ever lived!' - Biles stars as USA win gold Simone Biles inspired the United States to victory in the women's team gymnastics event as the first leg of a ""redemption tour"" began with a fifth Olympic gold. For the world's most decorated gymnast it is a first Olympic gold since Rio 2016 after she pulled out of several events in Tokyo three years ago with the 'twisties' - a disorientating mental block. Fellow sporting greats like Serena Williams and Michael Phelps were on their feet in the packed Bercy Arena as Biles' stunning Taylor Swift-inspired floor routine sealed gold for her and team-mates Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera.  Italy took silver and Brazil claimed bronze for their first medal in the event, while Great Britain came an agonising fourth.  Biles, 27, had made a sparkling return to the Olympic stage in Sunday's qualifying event, topping the all-around standings, booking her spot in three apparatus finals and also helping to send the United States into the team final as top qualifiers. And on Tuesday she carried on where she had left off as the Americans reclaimed the title they had lost to the Russian Olympic Committee at Tokyo 2020 in a final from which Biles pulled out after the first rotation to protect her mental and physical health. That led to her withdrawing from several other finals before returning to take bronze on the beam. She then took two years out before returning last year with Paris firmly in her sights and with even more skills in her repertoire. Arriving to a deafening reception from a crowd full of anticipation, Biles played it safe in the first rotation on vault with the 'easier' of her routines, rather than the harder one she did in qualifying. She then delivered excellent bars and beam routines before a crowd-pleasing floor display that sealed gold - and brought the whole arena to their feet as she and her team-mates jumped up and down in celebration. ""They called it their redemption tour, and that's what it is. They wanted the gold they couldn't get in Tokyo,"" coach Cecile Landi said. Biles' left calf was taped up as it was in qualifying but there was no hint of that bothering her as helped her team post a total of 171.296 to complete a convincing victory over Italy on 165.494.  Receiving her medal on top of the podium, eight years after she was last there, Biles smiled and waved to the crowd.   With four more finals still to come, it may not be the last time she does that. Her next opportunity is on Thursday in the all-around final, followed by the vault final on Saturday and the floor and beam finals on Monday. Simone Biles has won her first Olympic gold since Rio 2016 Great Britain were close to finishing on the podium but fell agonisingly short despite a marked improvement on their performance in the qualifying round. They were just 0.234 behind the third-placed Brazilians - which in this sport is not much more than a tiny wobble here and there. When Alice Kinsella nailed her beam routine in the final round, her GB team-mates all celebrated, thinking they had won a medal - before realising it had not been quite enough.  ""I am so proud of this team,"" said Kinsella, who helped GB to a surprise bronze in this event three years ago in Tokyo. ""We gave it our all tonight and we thought we did it - I am super proud of the girls."" There is one more chance of a women's gymnastics medal for Great Britain when Becky Downie competes in Sunday's uneven bars final. She increased her difficulty level in an already stacked routine to score a stunning 14.933 on Tuesday, which should fill her with confidence going into the individual event. Great Britain had been hit by injuries to some of their top gymnasts, including British all-around champion Ondine Achampong and Jessica Gadirova, meaning they picked teenagers Abigail Martin - still awaiting her GCSE results - Ruby Evans. Both youngsters stepped up to the challenge on the biggest stage and delivered performances that suggest a bright future for the team. It was a second fourth-place finish in two days for British gymnasts after the men's team missed out on a medal on Monday.  It might have been a team event but the night belonged in a large part to Biles, whose floor routine starts with pop superstar Swift's '... Ready for it?' And she proved she was. It was at this event three years ago where Biles had competed on the vault before deciding not to continue, sending shockwaves through the Games. She then sat out four individual finals before returning for the beam final, where she clinched bronze on an emotional return. Biles, who had entered Tokyo favourite to win five gold medals, went home having opened up a conversation about mental health - a powerful message from someone at the top of their sport that personal wellbeing and safety come above glory.  It inspired many, but also drew scorn from some who branded her a ""quitter"" at the time. She then took a two-year break before returning last summer. Paris was firmly in her thoughts as she came back performing some of her best gymnastics. And now the promise Biles has shown over the past year and in qualifying here has translated into another medal, a lot of joy and maybe some relief.  ""Simone was glad it was over for today,"" coach Landi said.  ""The whole team hasn't been easy, it's had its ups and downs so to make it happen was just a relief. ""After Tokyo I'm so happy we're here on the other side.""

Olympic organisers had lodged a complaint with police, after a ""banner bearing a political message was displayed"" during a Group D game between Israel and Paraguay on Saturday, a spokesperson said. One fan made ""gestures of an antisemitic nature"", they add. There have been reports of banners and chants during the game that referenced the ongoing war in Gaza. Neither the Paris prosecutor's office or Olympic officials have clarified the specifics behind the case. During the match some supporters could be seen holding a banner reading: ""Genocide Olympics"". French newspaper Le Parisien reported that this same group of fans later ""mimed provocative gestures of an antisemitic nature"", citing a police source. There are also reports that Israel's national anthem was booed by parts of the crowd, with news agency AFP reporting that some Israeli supporters chanted back ""free the hostages"". The match ended in a 4-2 victory for Paraguay. After the game the Olympic organising committee lodged a complaint with police. A Paris 2024 spokesperson said the organisation ""strongly condemns these acts"". ""Paris 2024 is committed to combating all forms of discrimination, which are in every way contrary to the Olympic and Paralympic values. ""We would like to remind everyone that the Games are a time for harmony and tolerance,"" they add. Meanwhile the prosecutors office has said it is also investigating death threats received by three Israeli athletes at the games. The threats were reported by Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, and the investigation will be led by the national anti-online hate body. The war in Gaza started when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October last year - killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. Since then more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's months-long campaign, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-30 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gy51v03mo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
886,Meet the 7ft 2in teenage Olympian set for the NBA,"This video can not be played Paris 2024: Meet Khaman Maluach, the South Sudanese refugee and NBA hopeful When you are 7ft 2in tall it is pretty tough to keep a low profile but for Khaman Maluach it is likely to get even harder over the next 12 months. The 17-year-old basketball phenomenon, who is competing for South Sudan at the Olympics, is expected to be one of the hottest properties in next year's National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft, with a host of teams already said to be clamouring for his signature. Maluach continues to show rapid growth in his game, but there is a lot more to the teenager's remarkable story than his abilities on the court. ""Basketball means a big thing to me. I believe it's a gift God gave me to impact other people's lives and to change my family's life,"" he told BBC Sport Africa. ""The orange ball has taken me so far."" South Sudan basketball win unites 'every single tribe' Basketball at the Paris 2024 Olympics Born in 2006, his family fled to neighbouring Uganda to escape the long-running conflict which eventually led to South Sudan gaining independence from Sudan in 2011. Maluach was raised in Kawempe, a town on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital Kampala which is home to many disadvantaged communities. He spent most of his time with his mother, six siblings and relatives from his mother's side since his father was mainly in South Sudan. He was first encouraged to play basketball after a chance encounter on the side of the road while walking back from school. ""A guy was on a bike and he suddenly stopped in front of me,"" Maluach recalled. ""He told me ‘'You should start playing basketball. I can get you shoes, I can get you the ball' if I started playing right away."" Maluach's closest public basketball court was a one-hour walk from his home, and it was often packed. Yet the distance was not the only thing threatening his daily games. Scarcity of basketballs and a lack of shoes was a big concern - with Maluach already a size 14 by the age of 13. He was forced to play his first game in a pair of Crocs, but made an immediate impression on local coaches Wal Deng and Aketch Garang. ""The first time I saw Khaman, I saw so much potential,"" Deng told BBC Sport Africa. ""I knew he was going to develop and become a better player. He learned so quick. I told Aketch that this kid will be the next big thing."" In 2021, just a year after he started playing basketball, Maluach was invited for a try-out by the NBA Academy Africa. Maluach had taught himself several moves by watching YouTube videos, learning from two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and 2023 MVP Joel Embiid. The fact that these two superstars have their roots in Africa inspired the centre to work even harder. ""Me and my brother would do this thing called a 'night shift',"" Maluach explained. ""When it reaches 12 midnight, they [the telecommunications company], give you a lot of [mobile data] at a cheaper price. The whole time, I would watch those guys. ""I used to see Giannis' jab step, and then with Joel I learned the shimmy. If they can make it there, I can make it there too."" How South Sudan's basketballers are making history in Paris Maluach already has plenty of experience on the big stage for South Sudan, including at last year's Fiba World Cup His hard work paid off, and coach Deng was among those who convinced him to take a scholarship with the NBA Academy Africa in Dakar, Senegal, although the move has meant personal sacrifices. Maluach has not seen his family in Kawempe for the past two years while he concentrates on developing his game and his academic studies. ""The Academy has helped me grow in so many ways,"" Maluach said. ""On the court, competing against the best talent on the continent kept me getting better all the time. ""One of the main reasons I took basketball to the next level is to get education. There was a time I spent two terms without going to school in Uganda."" His brother Majok keeps up the 'night shift' tradition to keep track of his younger sibling. ""I like watching him on YouTube because if I watch him on TV, I get emotional,"" he said. Fast forward three years and Maluach is a projected third pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, becoming eligible after committing to playing college basketball for Duke in the USA. Maluach hopes to share the court with Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo, who both have African heritage Playing in the Basketball Africa League (BAL) has also been critical in the teenager's development. It has given him a chance to play against top talent from across the continent in pressurised situations since making his debut, aged just 15, for South Sudan's Cobra Sport in 2022. The following year he went all the way to the final with AS Douanes of Senegal, while earlier this year he featured for City Oilers of Uganda. Away from the BAL, he won the MVP award at the 2023 Basketball Without Borders Africa event in Johannesburg where he was tutored by Miami Heat All-Star Bam Adebayo. With his own place in the NBA on the horizon, Maluach has lofty goals to match his height. ""I want to be a Hall of Famer,"" he said. ""That’s one of my long-term goals. Playing on the same court with Giannis and Joel Embiid."" Maluach will start playing college basketball in the United States for Duke after the Olympics One man crucial to Maluach's development into an international player has been Luol Deng, the former Chicago Bulls and Great Britain forward who was born in what is now South Sudan and grew up in London. President of South Sudan's basketball federation since 2019, the 39-year-old has been impressed with the professional demeanour and mental determination that Maluach has shown. ""With Khaman, I see a lot of myself in him,"" he told BBC Sport Africa. ""I've been around a lot of players [and] noise will distract them and stop them from their greatness. ""For him, he wants it. He knows what it takes to achieve it, and that's what makes him unique."" Last year Maluach, then aged 16, helped South Sudan qualify for the Olympics for the first time via the Fiba World Cup. He hopes the performances of the Bright Stars at Paris 2024 can inspire others on the African continent to realise their own potential. ""My long-term goal is putting Africa on the map, getting a lot of opportunities for kids because Africa has a lot of undiscovered talent,"" he said. ""All they need is an opportunity and a chance. ""I believe kids in my country are motivated and this Olympic thing is going to bring all of us together.""

Her success came on the day a heatwave hit Paris - and there was also disruption to the triathlon events. With the water quality in the River Seine still deemed too poor to swim in, the men's race has been pushed back to Wednesday and remains in doubt.

The 28-year-old, who set the world record by hitting 49/50 to win his first World Cup title in Linato last year, qualified for the final by recording a score of 123/125 from five rounds to progress joint-first in the 30-man field. Hales made the perfect start in the final, hitting 15 out of 15 shots, and held his lead throughout as the five other competitors were eliminated one by one. He celebrated by pumping his fist, before raising his shotgun in the air with both hands as fans waved British flags in the crowd, pipping China's Qi Yang, who took silver, and Guatemalan bronze medallist Jean Pierre Brol Cardenas. Guy, Dean, Richards and Scott then added Team GB's fourth gold of the Games and their 12th medal overall with success in the pool in the evening. The team held a slender lead going into the final leg before Scott brought the team home to win by a comfortable 1.35 seconds. Victory marked the first time a British relay quartet has retained an Olympic title in swimming or athletics. Elsewhere in the pool, Team Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen set a new Olympic record of 7:38.19 in the men’s 800m freestyle to become Northern Ireland’s first individual gold medallist since Lady Mary Peters in 1972.

Murray, 37 and partner Evans, 34, saved two match points in overcoming Gille and Vliegen to reach the quarter-finals - two days after saving five in their first-round win. After missing two match points of their own in the second-set tie-break, the British pair took their third in a see-saw first-to-10 match tie-break as Evans stuck away a volley. The pair jumped for joy before an elated, elongated embrace as Murray broke down in tears afterwards. They will be joined by Spanish Grand Slam-winning pair Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal in the last eight after they defeated the Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor and Wesley Koolhof, while in the women's doubles Britain's Heather Watson and Katie Boulter won their first-round tie. Team GB's hopes are over in the men's singles, however, after Jack Draper lost 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-2 to American seventh seed Taylor Fritz in the second round. This video can not be played 'Fabulous' Biles floor routine wraps up the gold for Team USA Biles is one of the true global stars at the Paris Olympics with her status underlined by the celebrities who were in attendance to watch her at the packed Bercy Arena, including fellow sporting greats Serena Williams and Michael Phelps. The 27-year-old went into the event as the world's most decorated gymnast, with 37 world and Olympic medals, before adding to her total with a dazzling performance across each rotation. She delivered excellent bars and beam routines before a crowd-pleasing floor display that sealed her fifth Olympic gold and eighth Games medal in total to help the USA finish ahead of Italy in silver and Brazil in bronze. Great Britain came an agonising fourth, just 0.234 of a point behind Brazil. There is reason for optimism for Team GB, however, after they completed their routines free of any major faults in a performance that will give them great confidence going into the individual finals.

But after swimming training for triathletes was cancelled on Sunday and Monday, tests revealed the water quality still did not reach the required standard. Heavy rainfall in Paris on Friday and Saturday has caused the water quality to diminish and the men's race has been put back to Wednesday at 09:45 BST. The women's event is due to start at 07:00 BST, but organisers say both races only have a 60% chance of going ahead. Friday remains a back-up date for both races and, as a last resort, organisers say the event could be contested as a duathlon - just the cycling and running legs. The Olympic surfing is being held in Tahiti, French Polynesia, but that has also been affected by bad weather, with Tuesday's sessions postponed because of adverse conditions. Team GB won medals in five of the six equestrian events at Tokyo 2020 but their preparations for Paris were jolted last week after a video emerged that showed Dujardin ""excessively"" whipping a horse. Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian pulled out of the 2024 Games and was replaced by Moody, who made the most of her opportunity by topping her group with a score of 74.938 to qualify for Sunday's individual final. She is likely to be joined by fellow Briton Carl Hester, who missed out on automatic qualification by coming third in his group with a score of 77.345, but is well placed to make it through as one of six athletes with the next highest overall scores. Charlotte Fry - the world number three - starts her campaign as qualification continues on Wednesday at 10:00 BST. Team GB currently sit second behind Denmark in the team standings and are in strong contention to qualify for Saturday's final.

888,Key moments which led to Venezuela protests,"There have been protests across Venezuela following the announcement on Monday of the disputed result of the presidential election.  The National Electoral Council (CNE) - which is dominated by government allies - declared Nicolás Maduro the winner.  The CNE's announcement has been widely decried as fraudulent both inside and outside Venezuela with the Carter Center demanding the CNE publish the detailed voting tallies. The opposition says the tallies it has had access to - which it has made public - show that its candidate, Edmundo González, is the clear winner. Here we look at some of the key moments which have led to thousands of Venezuelans taking to the streets in protest.  Even before polling stations opened at 06:00 local time on Sunday, long lines formed at many locations with some voters queueing overnight. There were reports of some voters being blocked from accessing their polling stations, while at others there were long delays.  Some of those keen to cast their ballot joined in a chorus of ""We want to vote"".  Many of the 7.8m Venezuelans who have fled their country's economic and political crisis were not able to cast their votes after they encountered problems adding their names to the electoral register.  The hurdles they faced included strict requirements such as having to provide proof of legal residence in the host country and providing a valid identity card as passports were not accepted as a form of identification. As identity cards are not issued by Venezuelan consulates abroad, this meant many Venezuelans whose IDs had expired could not vote.  Many also reported being left off the list of voters altogether or appearing on local registers in Venezuela rather than in their current countries of residence.  Others complained of consulates only opening for voter registration for very limited times. Official figures from the CNE show that fewer than 68,000 people overseas were registered to vote, even though an estimated half of the 7.8m Venezuelans abroad are of voting age.  Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) has five members who are nominated by the legislative body, the National Assembly. While it was created as an independent body to organise and oversee elections, it has long been dominated by allies of the governing PSUV party.  Its president, Elvis Amoroso, is a former lawmaker for President Maduro's socialist PSUV party who went to work as Mr Maduro's legal adviser.  Before being named head of the CNE, he served as comptroller general. In that post, he barred opposition leader María Corina Machado from running for office for 15 years.  As head of the CNE, he revoked the invitation which had been issued to the European Union to send independent electoral observers to monitor the presidential election. In the early hours on Monday, Mr Amoroso announced that with 80% of the votes counted, President Maduro had an ""unassailable lead"" with 51% of the vote. He said that the opposition candidate, Edmundo González, had 44% of the vote. However, the CNE did not provide a detailed breakdown of the results from individual polling stations.  The incumbent celebrated the announcement outside the Miraflores presidential palace. ""I am Nicolás Maduro Moros, the re-elected president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and I will defend our democracy, our laws and our people,"" he shouted.  Before a crowd of loyal supporters, he mocked and mimicked former opposition and current opposition leaders , whom he accused of ""crying fraud"" every time they lost an election. He praised the electoral system and urged ""respect"" for ""Venezuela's sovereignty"". Mr Maduro also alleged that the CNE had been the target of a ""massive hacking attack"" on election night because ""the demons didn't want the total tally to be announced"". ""We already he know who it was,"" he said.  ""We are setting an example for the world,"" he told his cheering supporters.   Shortly after the CNE had declared Mr Maduro's victory, opposition leader María Corina Machado denounced the result as fraudulent.  She said that the opposition had had access to 40% of the voting tallies and they suggested that opposition candidate Edmundo González had won with 70% of the votes. In a news conference some hours later on Monday, Ms Machado said the opposition had been able to review 73.2% of the voting tallies and they confirmed that Mr González was the winner of the election.  She said that those voting tallies showed that Nicolás Maduro had 2.75m votes compared to Mr González's 6.27m votes. She added that even if all the votes in the remaining 26.8% of tallies the opposition had not had access to yet were for Mr Maduro, it would not be enough to beat Mr González. ""We have the records showing our categorical and mathematically irreversible victory,"" Mr González said.  Ms Machado also announced that the opposition had uploaded the voting tallies to a website so that the Venezuelan people and independent observer could scrutinise them.  Despite international and national scepticism and criticism expressed about the result released by the CNE, the electoral authority doubled down on Monday. It announced that all of the votes had been counted and declared Mr Maduro re-elected to a third consecutive term. Elvis Amoroso, who has been a close ally of Mr Maduro for years, handed him the credentials for the presidential term from 2025-2031. Even though it pressed ahead with the formalities, the CNE still failed to provide access to all of the voting tallies, despite pressure by the Carter Center, one of the few international organisations allowed as observers, to do so. The already tense atmosphere was further inflamed by pro-government groups, the so-called colectivos and by clashes between protesters and the security forces. In one incident, members of a colectivo attacked people who were waiting to enter a polling station to witness the vote count.  A non-governmental group said on Tuesday that three people had died and dozens were injured in the protests which have erupted across Venezuela.  Also on Tuesday, Venezuela's attorney-general said 749 had been arrested during anti-government protests.  A Venezuelan opposition party - Voluntad Popular - said its national coordinator, Freddy Superlano, was among those detained.

889,Wondering what's on when? Find out here,"The Paris Olympics are well under way so what better way to plan ahead than with our day-by-day guide - all times BST.  Team GB has named a squad of 327 athletes and UK Sport has set a target of 50 to 70 medals at the Games.  There will be live coverage of Paris 2024 across the BBC on TV, radio and online.  The Games officially opened at a unique and spectacular opening ceremony along the River Seine on Friday, 26 July and will close on Sunday, 11 August. Full Paris 2024 schedule All you need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympics How to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBC Eighteen gold medals: Artistic gymnastics (men's individual all-around), BMX freestyle (men's and women's), canoe slalom (women's C1), diving (women's synchro 10m platform), fencing (men's sabre team), judo (women's-70kg, men's -90kg), rowing (men's quadruple sculls, women's quadruple sculls), shooting (women's trap), swimming (women's 100m free, men's 200m fly, women's 1500m free, men's 200m breast, men's 100m free), triathlon (women's and men's individual). Highlights On Wednesday, the women’s triathlon is due to start at 07:00, before the postponed men's event begins at 09:45. Tests are being carried out daily on the water quality in the River Seine, with a final test due at 02:30 BST on Wednesday. Team GB have a very strong women's team in world champion Beth Potter, Tokyo individual silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown and world top 10-ranked Kate Waugh. France’s Cassandre Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi are also contenders for gold at their home Games. Competitors start from the Pont Alexandre III bridge in view of the Eiffel Tower, swim 1500m in the Seine then run up a set of steps to start the 40km bike course, which includes some cobbled stretches. Lastly, there is a 10km run. In the men's race, GB's Alex Yee will hope to be at the front of the action. Yee won Olympic silver in a pulsating Tokyo contest three years ago. Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, who pulled past Yee to win gold that day, is back but has since moved up to Ironman distance then back down again, and it remains to be seen if he will master that transition. The men's all-around gymnastics final begins at 16:30, an event where athletes compete on all six apparatus to decide the best overall gymnast at the Olympics. Max Whitlock made it on to the Rio podium in this event eight years ago, but defending champion and multiple world title-winner Daiki Hashimoto is the favourite. We reach the freestyle BMX finals from 12:10, where GB's Kieran Reilly is a proven champion on the world stage, though Charlotte Worthington failed to reach the women's final. This is freestyle’s second Olympic appearance. To win gold, perform as many tricks as you can in 60 seconds and make sure they are better than anyone else’s. Wednesday could bring a medal opportunity for GB’s Mallory Franklin in the C1 women’s canoe slalom (final from 16:25). Australia’s Jessica Fox, one of the greatest canoeists of all time and the Tokyo champion, will be one of Franklin’s biggest rivals. Watch out for Elena Lilik, who beat Andrea Herzog – Tokyo’s bronze medallist – to claim Germany’s sole entry in this event. Brit watch Rowing’s quadruple sculls finals begin at 11:26. Britain are the world champions in the women’s event and picked up 2022 world silver in the men’s race. In shooting, Lucy Hall, a European silver medallist in 2022, will hope to feature in the women’s trap final at 14:30. Jemima Yeats-Brown lost her sister and biggest fan, Jenny, to brain cancer just after winning Commonwealth judo bronze in 2022. Yeats-Brown says that has helped inspire a “life’s too short” approach to competing that helped her secure fifth at the World Championships in 2023. She fights in the -70kg category, where medal contests start at 16:18. In hockey, GB’s women play South Africa at 09:30. World watch There is a lot of hype coming into Paris about David Popovici, a superstar of the Romanian team, but he had a tough 2023. The 100m freestyle is a chance for Popovici to make an impact after finishing seventh in Tokyo aged just 16, while Matt Richards swims for GB. Also watch for Anna Hopkin in the women’s 100m freestyle (19:30) and American Katie Ledecky in the women’s 1,500m free (20:04). In men’s basketball the US-South Sudan game (20:00) pits one of the most dominant teams in Olympic history against a first-time entrant. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011 and its basketball federation joined world governing body Fiba in 2013, so getting to the Olympics about a decade later is pretty good going, to put it mildly. At the heart of that story? Luol Deng, who played basketball for GB at London 2012. Deng, who spent a decade playing for the NBA’s Chicago Bulls, holds British and South Sudanese citizenship. For years as a coach, he has been a driving force (and financial force) behind the South Sudan team’s rise to Olympic status. Facing the US in Paris may be the pinnacle of that incredible story arc. Expert knowledge  Lois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix come into Paris 2024 as history-makers before they even start their first dive. The duo won world silver last year, the first time Britain had won any women’s diving medal at that level. If they win another medal here – the women’s 10m synchro diving final starts at 10:00 – watch for some cartwheels on the BBC studio sofa, as Andrea’s dad is Fred Sirieix, star of First Dates turned BBC presenter at Paris 2024. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's individual all-around), athletics (men's and women's 20km race walk), canoe slalom (men K1), fencing (women's foil team), judo (women's -78kg, men's -100kg), rowing (women's double sculls, men's double sculls, women's coxless four, men's coxless four), sailing (men's and women's skiff), shooting (men's 50m rifle 3 positions) and swimming (women's 200m fly, men's 200m back, women's 200m breast, women's 4x200m free relay). Highlights British rowers are used to heaps of gold medals – more than 30 of them in Olympic rowing. GB were the top rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Then came Tokyo and not one gold. They were 14th in the rowing medal table, which was a shock. Thursday might be the day we know if the Brits are turning that ship around. Helen Glover will hope to lead an impressive women’s four in the final at 10:50, while the men’s four won the world title in both 2022 and 2023. Their final is at 11:10. The space of about half an hour could play a huge role in deciding if this Olympic regatta is a GB return to form. The rowers are not the only ones who had a Tokyo to forget. Joe Clarke did not make the team despite being the defending Olympic champion in K1 slalom canoeing. Now, he is back and will hope to be a big factor in the Paris final from 16:30. The women’s all-around gymnastics final at 17:15 could see some remarkable history being made. If they are both healthy and nominated for this event, American duo Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee could make this the first women’s all-around final in which the past two Olympic champions have competed. Biles won in 2016, followed by Lee in 2020. If either of them wins gold, they will be the first woman to win multiple Olympic all-around titles since Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968. Brit watch Golf found its way back on to the Olympic schedule in 2016 after more than a century in the wilderness (or perhaps deep rough). At Paris 2024, the course is L’Albatros at Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2018. The first round of the men’s event starts at 08:00 and features GB’s Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood, Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and a host of the sport’s other big names. Luke Greenbank will hope to better his Tokyo bronze medal in the men’s 200m backstroke (19:37) at the pool. Meanwhile, Team GB have been top-four material of late in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay so could pose a medal threat there too (20:48). Beth Shriever has remained dominant in BMX racing since winning Olympic gold in Tokyo. However, she fractured her collarbone at the sport’s World Championships in May, meaning one of GB’s big medal hopes has faced a race against time. From 19:20 we will see how that comeback has progressed as the early stages of her event take place. In the men’s event, Olympic and world silver medallist Kye Whyte is returning from a back injury of his own. In hockey, GB’s men take on hosts France at 11:45, Ireland’s men play Argentina at 12:15 and GB’s women face the US at 16:00. Showjumping begins with the team qualifier from 10:00. Scott Brash and Ben Maher, who were part of Britain’s gold medal-winning team at London 2012, are joined this time around by Harry Charles. World watch Back at the pool, Katie Ledecky may have a shot at some Olympic history by this point in the Games. If she has won two medals by this point – very possible, given the 200m free and 400m free will have been and gone, and she has won golds in both in the past – then a medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay (20:48) would be her 13th overall, a record for a US female Olympian. (Three American women, all of them swimmers, have previously reached 12: Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin.) The men’s and women’s 20km race walks begin at 06:30 and 08:20 respectively. Chinese veteran Liu Hong, the 2016 women’s champion, is trying to end a run of five years – ages, by her standards – without a major title. Spain’s Maria Perez is the world champion, having been on the brink of quitting the sport in 2022 after back-to-back disqualifications at that year’s European and world championships. Another Spanish athlete, Alvaro Martin, is the men’s world champion. At Roland Garros, we reach the first tennis semi-finals from 11:00. Expert knowledge The first sailing medals of the Games will be awarded in the skiff class. For the men, this means the 49er, and for the women it is the 49er FX (a version designed to work with a lighter two-person crew than the 49er). Saskia Tidey is at her third Olympics and representing her second country in sailing.  Tidey sailed for Ireland in 2016, then switched to GB for Tokyo once it became apparent that she had no suitable Irish partner available in the two-person event. Tidey and GB team-mate Charlotte Dobson finished sixth three years ago, and now Tidey is back with new partner Freya Black. The two were European bronze medallists in May. GB’s James Peters and Fynn Sterritt, in the men’s event, said before the Games they had been trying to put on weight after realising they were one of the lighter boats in the men’s fleet. Britain are the defending champions in this event after Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell won gold three years ago.  Gold medal events: Archery (mixed team), athletics (men's 10,000m), badminton (mixed doubles), BMX racing (men's and women's), diving (men's synchro 3m springboard), equestrian (jumping team), fencing (men's epee team), judo (women's +78kg, men's +100kg), rowing (men's coxless pair, women's coxless pair, men's lightweight double sculls, women's lightweight double sculls), sailing (men's and women's windsurfing), shooting (women's 50m rifle 3 positions), swimming (men's 50m free, women's 200m back, men's 200m individual medley), tennis (mixed doubles), trampoline gymnastics (women's and men's). Highlights Keely Hodgkinson, tipped to be one of Team GB’s biggest stars in Paris, appears for the first time in the 800m heats from 18:45. The 22-year-old is hoping to upgrade Tokyo silver to gold in 2024. Earlier, Dina Asher-Smith will be in the opening stages of the women’s 100m from 10:50. She, like Hodgkinson, won the European title in her event last month. Jack Laugher will dive with his third different partner in as many Olympics when he competes in the men’s 3m synchro diving from 10:00. Anthony Harding is Laugher’s team-mate this time. They have won two world silver medals together, each time behind China. Laugher won this event with Chris Mears at Rio 2016. It is BMX racing finals day. If Beth Shriever and Kye Whyte have recovered from pre-Games injuries and are still in the running, they will have to negotiate the semi-finals before the gold-medal races from 20:35. Both riders are in the world’s top six. France have a trio of highly rated riders on the men’s side, while Australia’s Saya Sakakibara is seeking redemption in the women’s event after a semi-final crash in Tokyo. Bryony Page stunned the field when she took the first Olympic trampoline medal in Britain’s history, silver in 2016. She added bronze in Tokyo and has won two of the past three world titles, setting up one another bid for gold aged 33 before she pursues her dream of joining the acrobats at Cirque du Soleil. Qualifying is at 11:00 before the final at 12:50. Lightweight scullers Emily Craig and Imogen Grant missed a medal in the women’s lightweight double sculls by 0.01 seconds in Tokyo. Since then, they have won back-to-back world titles and are considered one of the British rowing team’s best hopes for gold in Paris. The final takes place at 11:22. In sailing, windsurfing reaches its final day. This year’s windsurfing event involves a new class, iQFoil, which replaces the old RS:X class. The way the IOC explains the difference is that “instead of floating, the board appears to fly” in the iQFoil class because of hydrofoils that lift the board out of the water at certain speeds. Emma Wilson, who won RS:X bronze in Tokyo, has world silver and bronze medals in iQFoil and will hope to be going for a podium place on Friday. Brit watch Swimming on Friday features GB’s Ben Proud versus American Caeleb Dressel in the men’s 50m freestyle (final at 19:30). Dressel is the Tokyo Olympic champion, while Proud has a gold and two bronzes from the past three World Championships. Australia’s Cameron McEvoy will also be hoping for a medal. In shooting, world number one Seonaid McIntosh takes aim in the women’s 50m rifle three positions from 08:30. The “three positions” part means you shoot kneeling, prone (lying down) and standing. Friday’s equestrian highlight is the team jumping final at 13:00, featuring a British team who took world bronze behind Sweden and the Netherlands in 2022. In hockey, Ireland’s men play New Zealand at 16:00, followed by GB against Germany at 19:15. World watch Returning to the pool, the men’s 200m individual medley (19:49) offers an opportunity for French swimming star Leon Marchand to try to surpass Ryan Lochte’s world record time. Lochte’s record is one minute 54.00 seconds, while Marchand got down to 1:54.82 in winning world gold ahead of GB’s Duncan Scott and Tom Dean last year. Tokyo silver medallist Scott and Dean will hope to make the Paris final, while Tokyo champion Wang Shun of China is back. In the men's 50m freestyle, France will be cheering for Florent Manaudou, London 2012 gold medallist in the event and one of the hosts’ two flagbearers at the opening ceremony. Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei has dominated the men’s 10,000m but was beaten by Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega in an extraordinarily humid Tokyo 2020 final. Both are back for 2024 and this is the only title on offer during the opening night of athletics (20:20). Badminton’s mixed doubles final (15:10) is highly likely to have at least one Chinese entry and it would be no surprise if, like Tokyo, the final was between two Chinese teams. Three years ago, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong were defeated by Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping. Gold medallist Wang has since retired, so silver medallists Zheng and Huang Yaqiong may end up facing Huang Dongping and new partner Feng Yanzhe this time around. Archery’s mixed team final takes place from 15:43. In Tokyo, an arrow from South Korea’s An San hit and split an arrow shot by team-mate Kim Je-deok on their way to gold in this event. This is almost impossible to achieve and is known as a “Robin Hood arrow”. According to World Archery, this may have been the first time a Robin Hood arrow was ever filmed in competition. The two arrows are now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Tennis reaches the mixed doubles final and men’s singles semi-finals (11:00-20:00). The men’s football quarter-finals take place in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux with kick-offs between 14:00 and 20:00. In women’s 3x3 basketball, two of the world’s top-ranked nations – France and the US – meet at 12:00. Expert knowledge Teddy Riner will try to equal the Olympic judo record for three individual gold medals in front of his home crowd. The 100+kg event’s medal rounds begin at 16:49. Riner is virtually unbeatable. Between September 2010 and February 2020, he won 154 consecutive contests. At the Tokyo Olympics, he had to settle for bronze after losing to Russia’s Tamerlan Bashaev, his first defeat at the Games since 2008. He has not lost at Grand Slam or World Championship level since Tokyo. Gold medal events: Archery (women's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's floor, women's vault, men's pommel horse finals), athletics (men's shot put, women's triple jump, mixed 4x400m relay, women's 100m, men's decathlon), badminton (women's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix special team), fencing (women's sabre team), judo (mixed team), road cycling (men's road race), rowing (women's single sculls, men's single sculls, women's eight, men's eight), shooting (women's 25m pistol, men's skeet), swimming (men's 100m fly, women's 200m individual medley, women's 800m free, mixed 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (women's singles), tennis (women's singles, men's doubles). Highlights Britain’s fastest female sprinter, Dina Asher-Smith, will hope to line up in the 100m final at 20:20. Asher-Smith has changed coach and moved to train in Texas since a disappointing eighth place in last year’s world final. “I want to win the Olympics and I want to run really fast,” she has said. Big rivals include US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson and Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson. Richardson has the year’s leading mark of 10.71 seconds. At 16:10, the pommel horse final is Max Whitlock’s chance to deliver on his aim of an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus. Ireland’s world champion and pommel horse specialist Rhys McClenaghan will have his sights on gold. The women’s vault final (15:20) may feature Simone Biles, the Rio 2016 champion, returning to an event from which she withdrew in Tokyo. This is the last day of rowing and the very last final on the list is the men’s eight (10:10). Britain won this event in 2016 but New Zealand were the winners in Tokyo. GB have recovered to win the past two world titles. Defending champions Canada, Romania and the US are contenders in the women’s eight (09:50). Dressage’s team event concludes from 09:00. GB have not been off the Olympic podium since a memorable victory at London 2012, but can they get back to the top step? Brit watch It is the penultimate night at the pool. GB smashed the world record to win the mixed 4x100m medley relay (20:33) when it was held for the first time at the Tokyo Games. This is a great relay to watch as there is a heap of strategy involved in looking at your team’s strengths and weaknesses, then deciding who you put on which leg. It is often not clear which team’s plan is paying off until the final moments. Cycling returns with the men’s road race (10:00). GB have qualified a full four-man team that features Tom Pidcock, who only just competed in Olympic mountain-biking last week, never mind half of the Tour de France before dropping out with Covid. The course reaches a climax with three laps of cobbled climb before a downhill stretch and a sprint towards the Trocadero. Kayak cross is new at the Olympics. If you have seen snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics then – yes, that, except in whitewater. Instead of the usual Olympic slalom canoeing against the clock, paddlers race each other to the finish. They have to turn around in whitewater, flip their boats and perform all sorts of other manoeuvres along the way. The opening rounds begin at 14:30 and Team GB have some of the world’s best athletes. Saturday’s hockey includes GB’s women versus Argentina at 09:00. World watch Serena Williams, Monica Puig and Belinda Bencic are your last three women’s singles tennis champions at the Olympics. Who will it be this time? World number one Iga Swiatek has Olympic success in her blood – her dad, Tomasz Swiatek, was a rower for Poland at Seoul 1988. The hosts will pin their hopes on Caroline Garcia making it this far. This is also the day of the men’s doubles final, an event that includes Andy Murray and Dan Evans plus Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski for GB. Elsewhere in the night’s swimming action, Katie Ledecky has a shot at a fourth consecutive gold in the women’s 800m freestyle (20:09). It could be close, though. Last time, in Tokyo, Ariarne Titmus was just a second behind her – the first time anyone had been within four seconds of Ledecky in an Olympic final over this distance. On the track, the men’s 100m first round (from 10:45) allows us a first look at world champion Noah Lyles and Christian Coleman, both representing the US, as well as GB trio Zharnel Hughes, Louie Hinchliffe and Jeremiah Azu. Keep an eye out for “Africa’s fastest man” Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya and Jamaican title challenger Kishane Thompson. The decathlon concludes with the 1500m race at 20:45. France’s Kevin Mayer, a silver medallist in Tokyo and Rio, will be trying to upgrade that on home soil, although team-mate Makenson Gletty comes in with a better world ranking. Canada, boasting Olympic champion Damian Warner and world champion Pierce LePage, will be tough to beat. Badminton’s women’s doubles is a big target for Indonesia. Apriyani Rahayu won Tokyo gold with Greysia Polii and is now paired with Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti after Polii’s retirement. China’s Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan are the favourites. The two teams meet each other in the group stages, which may help set the scene for Saturday’s final (15:10). Women football reaches the quarter-final stage with games kicking off at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 20:00. Expert knowledge  Ledecky is not the only athlete capable of racking up a fourth gold medal in an event on Saturday. Skeet shooter Vincent Hancock won gold in Beijing, London and Tokyo for the US, a remarkable record marred only by finishing 15th in Rio. This time around, Hancock is coming in ranked 17th in the world. As of the start of Saturday, only six people have won the same individual event four times at the Olympics: Denmark’s Paul Elvstrom in sailing, Americans Al Oerter and Carl Lewis in athletics, Japan’s Kaori Icho and Cuba’s Mijain Lopez in wrestling, and Michael Phelps for the US in swimming. Nobody has ever won the same individual event five times at the Olympics (although it could happen in Paris – see Tuesday, 6 August). Ledecky at LA 2028, anyone? Olympic Games fan zones to be set up across the UK Olympics 2024: how extreme weather could impact Paris games Gold medal events: Archery (men's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's rings, women's uneven bars, men's vault), athletics (women's high jump, men's hammer throw, men's 100m), badminton (men's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix freestyle individual), fencing (men's foil team), golf (men's round 4), road cycling (women's road race), shooting (women's skeet), swimming (women's 50m free, men's 1500m free, men's 4x100m medley relay, women's 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (men's singles), tennis (women's doubles and men's singles). Highlights Sunday at 20:55 is go time for the men’s 100m final. Will Zharnel Hughes be on the start line for GB after a world bronze last year? Will Noah Lyles become the first American to win this event since 2004? Can Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo pull off an upgrade on last year’s world silver? Roland Garros hosts the Olympic men’s singles final. Many fans would love a Nadal-Djokovic Olympic final on clay here. They have met once before at the Games, in the Beijing 2008 semi-finals, which Nadal won. Realistically, the Spaniard may have a better chance of a medal in the doubles. Serbia's Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to win the one big title still missing from his collection. The final round of the men’s golf competition begins at 08:00. American Xander Schauffele will be in Paris to defend his title, and he has said an Olympic gold medal is proving increasingly valuable in a sport that, until Rio 2016, was all about its four majors. Spain’s Jon Rahm will be one of the highest-profile LIV Golf players at the Games. Lizzie Deignan is the first female British cyclist to be selected for four Olympic Games. Deignan – the London 2012 silver medallist and 2015 world champion – is joined by national champion Pfeiffer Georgi, Anna Henderson and Anna Morris for Sunday’s women’s road race, which starts at 13:00. A strong Dutch team for this race features Ellen van Dijk, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes and Marianne Vos, who won gold in London 12 years ago. Brit watch With Charlotte Dujardin pulling out on Tuesday, team-mate Lottie Fry - daughter of Laura, who rode at Barcelona 1992 – could be one of the biggest challengers in this event. In gymnastics, Jake Jarman won world vault gold last year and backed it up with a European title in April. The 22-year-old has the chance to turn that form into an Olympic title at 15:25. Becky Downie could be a contender in the uneven bars from 14:40. Amber Rutter welcomed her first child to the world in April. Now she’s shooting for skeet gold at Paris 2024 (qualification from 08:30, final from 14:30). Rutter missed Tokyo 2020 through a positive Covid test just before she travelled, which she says was devastating at the time but ultimately helped reshape her life goals to include both personal priorities and Olympic aims. In track and field action, world silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith is in the opening round of the men’s 400m from 18:05. Men’s hockey reaches the quarter-final stages. World watch The first round of the men’s 110m hurdles begins at 10:50. Grant Holloway was the Tokyo favourite until he “lost composure” in his words and allowed Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment to thunder past. Holloway has since won both available world titles and is on the US team for Paris. In the women’s 400m hurdles first round (11:35) watch for another American, defending champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, testing herself against Dutch world champion Femke Bol. The last night of swimming at Paris 2024 (from 17:30) features four finals: the women’s 50m free, men’s 1,500m free, men’s 4x100m medley and women’s 4x100m medley. Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom is a big contender in the women’s 50m free, while the women’s 4x100m medley could turn into a classic US-Australia battle. GB won men’s medley silver in Tokyo. The table tennis men’s singles final could be an opportunity for China’s Ma Long to extend an extraordinary Olympic streak (13:30). Ma comes into the Games having won all five Olympic titles available to him since 2012 – three team, two individual. Expert knowledge We are well into the quarter-finals and semi-finals of boxing’s various weights. In the women’s middleweight division (75kg), where quarter-finals take place on Sunday, UK-based Cindy Ngamba is fighting for the Olympic Refugee Team. Ngamba is unable to return to Cameroon, where she was born, because of her sexuality – homosexuality in the country is punishable with up to five years in prison. She is the first boxer ever selected for an Olympic refugee team. Fencing at Paris 2024 concludes with men’s team foil (19:30), a perfect finale for the hosts, who are the defending champions. To score a point, you need to strike your opponent on their torso, shoulder or neck with the tip of your weapon. You also need to have “right of way” which, if you’re new to fencing, is a concept best left to the referee, who decides which fencer has attacking priority at any given time. In the team event, everyone cycles through a series of mini head-to-head match-ups until one team scores 45. Alternatively, the highest-scoring team wins if the ninth and final bout ends without either team reaching 45. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (men's parallel bars, women's balance beam, men's horizontal bar, women's floor), athletics (men's pole vault, women's discus throw, women's 5,000m, women's 800m), badminton (women's singles, men's singles), basketball 3x3 (men's and women's), canoe slalom (men's and women's kayak cross), shooting (men's 25m rapid fire pistol, mixed team skeet), track cycling (women's team sprint), triathlon (mixed team relay).  Highlights In a fast and dazzling Tokyo 800m final, Keely Hodgkinson delivered a sensational Olympic silver medal in a time that broke a British record set by Kelly Holmes in 1995. Three years later, can she go one better? Athing Mu, who took gold in Tokyo, will not be in Paris after falling during US Olympic trials, but Kenyan world champion Mary Moraa will. The final starts at 20:45. When mixed team triathlon (starts 07:00) was introduced to the Olympics in Tokyo, the GB team of Jonny Brownlee, Jess Learmonth, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yee won it. This time around, France and Germany are likely to be major medal threats. Action starts at the Velodrome de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, just west of Paris. Track cycling’s opening day includes the women’s team sprint (from 16:00, final 18:58), where GB have qualified a team for the first time since London 2012. Sophie Capewell helped GB to world silver in the event last year. Her dad, Nigel, recorded fourth-place finishes in Paralympic track cycling at Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000. Kayak cross reaches a climax with the women’s final at 15:55 and men’s final at 16:00. GB’s Joe Clarke has back-to-back world titles in this event, which is new to the Olympics and features paddlers racing each other along the rapids. Clarke’s team-mate Kimberley Woods also won world gold last year. France are likely to be a big factor in both events. Could this be the last time you see Simone Biles in action? The beam final (11:36) and women's floor final (13:20) take place on artistic gymnastics’ last day at Paris 2024, which is 27-year-old Biles’ third Olympic Games. The beam final could see the baton passed to the next generation, since Hezly Rivera – at 16, the youngest athlete on the US team – won this event at US Olympic trials. Brit watch The world might be focused on Biles but GB will be keeping an eye on Joe Fraser, who is a past world and European gold medallist on parallel bars. That final begins at 10:45. Sport climbing, which made its debut at the Tokyo Olympics, returns from 09:00 with more medals this time around. What was one combined event in Tokyo is now two competitions in Paris. The first is boulder and lead, where climbers work to solve short but complex climbs in bouldering then go for maximum height in lead climbing, all of which is done in set time windows. The second is speed climbing, which is against the clock. The change in format opens up new avenues for competitors like GB’s 19-year-old Toby Roberts, already multiple times a champion in boulder and lead climbing at World Cup level. Hockey’s women’s quarter-finals run throughout the day. World watch Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis keeps on setting pole vault world records. His latest was 6.24m in April this year, and you can expect him to entertain the Paris crowd while trying to better that in his final from 18:00. France’s Renaud Lavillenie will not be there to rival him – the London 2012 champion has struggled after hamstring surgery and did not hit the qualifying height of 5.82m. Elsewhere on the track, the first round of the men’s 400m hurdles (09:05) is a chance to see Norway’s Karsten Warholm, the Tokyo champion, and biggest rivals Rai Benjamin of the US, who has the better form coming into Paris, and Brazil’s Alison dos Santos. 3x3 basketball reaches a climax with the women’s final at 21:05 and the men’s final at 21:35. The US won the women’s title in Tokyo, while Latvia are the defending men’s champions. Badminton concludes with the women’s singles final at 09:55 and men’s singles final at 14:40. Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen was the only European to win an Olympic badminton title in Tokyo three years ago and could go all the way again in Paris. South Korea’s An Se-young and China’s Chen Yufei are among the favourites for women’s gold. Football’s men’s semi-finals take place at 17:00 and 20:00. Expert knowledge Artistic swimming, formerly known as synchronised swimming, begins at 18:30 with the team technical routine. This is one of the few instances in which a major change to a sport will result in precisely nothing different for anyone watching. A rule change allowed men to take part in the team event for the first time in Olympic history, but – perhaps partly because the change took place only 18 months ago – no men actually qualified, so this will still be an all-female event. “This should have been a landmark moment for the sport,” governing body World Aquatics said, promising to work harder to help male athletes succeed. Forty-five-year-old Bill May was the only male artistic swimmer with a realistic chance of selection, but the US left him out of their team. Before that, May had said no men at the Games would represent “a slap in the face”. US selectors said they had to pick the strongest line-up. Surprising moments in Olympic history World Athletics to become first federation to award prize money at Olympic Games Gold medal events: Athletics (women's hammer throw, men's long jump, men's 1500m, women's 3000m steeplechase, women's 200m), boxing (women's 60kg), diving (women's 10m platform), equestrian (jumping individual), sailing (men's and women's dinghy), skateboard (women's park), track cycling (men's team sprint), wrestling (men's Greco-Roman 60kg, men's Greco-Roman 130kg, women's freestyle 68kg). Highlights The women’s 200m final (20:40) could be stacked with US talent. The three Americans named for this event are the three fastest women in the world over this distance in 2024: Gabby Thomas, McKenzie Long and Brittany Brown. GB’s Dina Asher-Smith was the world champion in 2019 and a world bronze medallist in 2022. Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, the Tokyo champion, has withdrawn from Paris 2024 through injury. The men’s 1500m is likely to star Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who broke the European record earlier this month. His main obstacle? GB’s Josh Kerr. We have not seen Kerr over 1500m this season but he is the world champion and declared himself on Instagram to be “working in the shadows, getting ready for the spotlights”. The final takes place at 19:50. In skateboarding, it is the women’s park final at 16:30. Sky Brown was 13 when she won Olympic bronze for GB in Tokyo and now, aged 16, she is back on the team. Not only that, she enters the Games having won last year’s world title. Ben Maher and Explosion W won a six-way jump-off to take Tokyo individual jumping gold, completing back-to-back GB victories after Nick Skelton won the same event (also in a six-way jump-off) in 2016. This time, Maher is back for GB on Point Break. Watch out for Swedish duo Henrik von Eckermann and Peder Fredricson. Fredricson has had the heartbreak of being second to the Brits in the jump-off in both Rio and Tokyo. The final starts at 09:00. Brit watch Women’s team pursuit qualifying begins in the velodrome at 16:30. Germany set a world record to defeat GB in Tokyo’s final. Since then, GB have gone through a rebuild and made their way back up the world podium to become world champions last year. However, Katie Archibald is out of the Games after breaking her leg in a freak garden accident, so it remains to be seen how her team-mates regroup. Sailing has scrapped its Finn class, which is unfortunate from a British perspective given GB had won it the past six times. That means attention turns to Micky Beckett in the single-handed dinghy (the ILCA 7, which you might also know as the Laser), which has its medal races on Tuesday. Beckett was a world silver medallist last year and has since racked up major wins like the Princess Sofia Regatta. On the women’s side of that class, GB’s Hannah Snellgrove is competing after what she characterises as a 15-year battle for selection, during which she earned money as a local journalist and part of a folk music act to keep her sailing career going. World watch Ireland’s Kellie Harrington will hope to successfully defend her Tokyo 2020 lightweight boxing title (final at 22:06). Harrington went years without defeat before losing at the European Championships in April. Amy Broadhurst, who switched to Britain after missing out on selection for Ireland, narrowly failed to make the GB team. But Harrington may have to contend with France’s Estelle Mossely, who won the Olympic title before her in Rio then turned pro. Mossely, who has won 11 and drawn one of her 12 professional fights, returned to amateur status and made the French team in the lightweight category. China have won every women’s 10m platform diving event at the Olympics since 2008. The past two times, they took the silver medal as well. Gold and silver have gone to China at each of the past four world championships, too. That means GB’s Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix, who took world bronze this year, has a job on to get any further up the podium – but it’s not impossible. The final is from 14:00. Women’s football semi-finals take place at 17:00 and 20:00. In hockey, the men’s semis are at 13:00 and 18:00. Wrestling’s first Paris 2024 medals are awarded, bringing with them a chance to watch some history. In the men’s Greco-Roman 130kg final (19:30), Cuba’s Mijain Lopez – if gets there – could become the first person to win the same individual Olympic event five times in a row, two weeks before his 42nd birthday. Expert knowledge It’s OK to take some time to adjust if you’re a British track cycling fan. Paris 2024 will be the first time since 1996 that the GB line-up for an Olympics has not included one or both of Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Jason Kenny. In that time, GB won the men's team sprint three times in a row from 2008 to 2016, but the Dutch knocked the British off that perch in 2021. Watch the event from 17:59. (What’s that, you really need Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny to be there? Fine – Kenny is now the GB sprint coach, so he will still be in the velodrome, while Hoy is part of the BBC’s coverage team.) Gold medal events: Artistic swimming (team acrobatic routine), athletics (marathon race walk mixed relay, women's pole vault, men's discus throw, men's 400m, men's 3000m steeplechase), boxing (men's 63.5kg, men's 80kg), sailing (mixed dinghy, mixed multihull), skateboard (men's park), sport climbing (women's speed), taekwondo (men's 58kg, women's 49kg), track cycling (men's team pursuit, women's team pursuit), weightlifting (men’s 61kg, women's 49kg), wrestling (men's Greco-Roman 77kg, men's Greco-Roman 97kg, women's freestyle 50kg). Highlights Matthew Hudson-Smith is considered the centre of a British revival over 400m after GB failed to field an athlete in this event three years ago. Hudson-Smith has come through a series of injuries and mental health struggles to be one of the world’s leading male 400m runners this season. Rivals in his final (20:20) could include American Quincy Hall and Grenada’s Kirani James, one of a six-strong Grenada team at Paris 2024 and the only Grenadian ever to win an Olympic medal (three, including gold at London 2012). It is team pursuit night at the velodrome. Britain’s men did not make it to the final in Tokyo, while the women finished with silver. Can Team GB recapture some of their track cycling dominance in one of the Olympics’ most exhilarating split-screen events? Find out from 17:04. John Gimson and Anna Burnet narrowly missed out on a Tokyo Olympic title in sailing’s mixed Nacra 17 class, a racing catamaran. They are the 2020 and 2021 world champions but their nemeses in this class are Italy’s Ruggero Tita and Caterina Banti, who won Tokyo gold and have taken the past three world titles, too. Can Gimson and Burnet find a way past in Paris? The medal race is today. In the 470 mixed dinghy class, also finishing today, GB have 2022 world silver medallists in Chris Grube and Vita Heathcote. Grube, 39, who twice finished fifth at the Olympics in the men’s 470 alongside Luke Patience, was coaxed out of retirement to pair up with 23-year-old Heathcote. Brit watch The first round of the men’s 800m (10:55) features Ben Pattison, who won a surprise world bronze medal last year. Team-mate Max Burgin ran Pattison close at June’s British Championships and has previously posted world leading times, but has struggled with injury in recent years. Jake Wightman, who won a European silver medal in 2022, is also on the start list for GB. In skateboarding, the British are used to the idea that in Sky Brown, the sport has one of Team GB’s youngest stars. But you can be an amazing skateboarder a little later in life, too. Andy Macdonald is on the team at the age of 50 – he will be 51 by the time Wednesday rolls around – making him the oldest athlete in Olympic skateboarding’s short history. He has a child older than team-mates Brown and Lola Tambling. Macdonald, a veteran of eight X Games gold medals in the late 90s and early 2000s, announced in 2022 that he would switch from representing the US to GB in a bid to reach Paris. His park event’s prelims are at 11:30 and the final is at 16:30. World watch Thailand have never won an Olympic medal in a sport other than boxing, taekwondo or weightlifting. Atthaya Thitikul has a chance to change that and has been installed among the bookies’ favourites for gold in Paris women’s golf. Nelly Korda, the defending champion, won six of her first eight tournaments this season but has since missed a series of cuts. The first round starts at 08:00 with GB’s Georgia Hall and Charley Hull in action alongside Ireland’s Leona Maguire and Stephanie Meadow. At the athletics track, the first round of the women’s 100m hurdles (09:15) includes Nigerian world record-holder Tobi Amusan, cleared to compete by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in late June after a row over alleged missed doping tests. Commonwealth bronze medallist Cindy Sember runs for GB. Australia’s Nina Kennedy and America’s Katie Moon shared the women’s pole vault world title last year and still appear almost inseparable heading into the Games. Add to that GB’s Molly Caudery, who was fifth last year at the Worlds but is widely tipped to make the Olympic podium having just set a British record of 4.92m. That is the world’s best mark so far this year and would have been enough to beat Moon and Kennedy in 2023. The final starts at 18:00. The women’s speed climbing title (from 11:28) could be between US duo Emma Hunt and Piper Kelly. Artistic swimming’s team event concludes from 18:30. The absence of Russia blows this contest wide open, since the Russians have won every Olympic team title in this sport from 2000 onwards. China and the US might step in. Hockey’s women’s semi-finals are at 13:00 and 18:00. The first weightlifting medals are awarded. In the men’s 61kg, Indonesia’s Eko Yuli Irawan could become the first weightlifter to earn an Olympic medal in five consecutive Games, although he has never won gold. Expert knowledge The Olympic 50km race walk, a feat of extraordinary endurance for athlete and spectator alike, is a thing of the past. It was the only men’s athletics event on the 2020 programme that did not have a women’s equivalent, while the four hours or so needed to televise it often did not electrify broadcasters. Its replacement? The race walk mixed relay. Each team sends one male and one female athlete, who each do two alternating stages of around 10km. The course is inspired by the Women’s March on Versailles of 1789, a key event in the French Revolution. Expect to see the Grand Palais, Louvre, Palace of Versailles and Eiffel Tower. This video can not be played Paris 2024: Skateboarder Sky Brown faces a UK vs French food test Gold medal events: Athletics (women's long jump, men's javelin throw, men's 200m, women's 400m hurdles, men's 110m hurdles), boxing (women's 54kg, men's 51kg), canoe sprint (men's C2 500m, men's K4 500m, women's K4 500m), diving (men's 3m springboard), hockey (men's), sailing (men's and women's kite medal series), sport climbing (men's speed), swimming (women's 10km marathon), taekwondo (men's 68kg, women's 57kg), track cycling (men's omnium medal, women's keirin), weightlifting (women's 59kg, men's 73kg), wrestling (men's Greco-Roman 67kg, men's Greco-Roman 87kg, women's freestyle 53kg). Highlights Two-time Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones is hunting for a third gold medal from 08:10, with the gold-medal contest at 20:39. Jones won in London and Rio but suffered a shock early exit in Tokyo. Her build-up to Paris has not been perfect, not least a doping case where she avoided a ban over a refused test because of “very exceptional circumstances”. Up to now, no taekwondo athlete has won three Olympic golds. Meanwhile, watch out for world champion Bradly Sinden looking to upgrade his Tokyo silver in the men’s taekwondo’s -68kg category. Sinden had to settle for second after a dramatic reversal in the dying moments of his final three years ago. He says that disappointment “will always be there"" unless he wins in Paris. Noah Lyles is one of the headline names at the track on Thursday. Lyles is one of the most dominant male sprinters since Usain Bolt, barely losing a race over 200m for most of the past decade. One of the ones he did lose? The last Olympic final, where Lyles finished third. Watch for GB’s Zharnel Hughes. The final is at 19:30. Jack Laugher is back in the men’s diving 3m springboard. The final starts at 14:00. Laugher has silver and bronze in this event from the past two Olympics. Can he close the gap on China’s relentless winners in this event, or will it be a scrap to reach the podium? In the velodrome, GB’s Ollie Wood and Ethan Hayter both have the experience needed to contend for a medal in the men’s omnium, with Hayter winning the world title in 2021 and 2022. France’s Benjamin Thomas also has multiple world titles to his name and will be targeting this event, which runs over four events starting at 16:00. The women’s keirin, where cyclists follow an electric bike in the opening laps before a sprint finish, could feature double European silver medallist Emma Finucane for GB (from 16:18). The men’s hockey final takes place at 18:00 at Yves-du-Manoir Stadium in Colombes, on the northern outskirts of Paris. This stadium is more than a century old, having been used as the main stadium at the last Paris Olympics in 1924. Brit watch The heptathlon rolls into action from 09:05 with the 100m hurdles, the first of seven events that decides the overall champion. GB’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson became world champion again in 2023 after years of injuries and disappointment, and will be joined by team-mate Jade O'Dowda. In Marseille, kiteboarding’s Olympic debut reaches a climax. As it sounds, kiteboarding involves athletes using a giant kite to ride their board across the ocean. European champion Ellie Aldridge and Connor Bainbridge are the GB female and male entrants respectively. Athletes can hit speeds of up to 50mph. World watch Last time, Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment beat him to gold. Can anyone stand in the way of a men’s 110m hurdles title for Grant Holloway this time? The American looks in dominant form. The final is at 20:45. The men’s speed climbing final (11:55) could feature Italy’s Matteo Zurloni, who burst to the peak of his sport with a world title last year. Having said that, a big factor in Zurloni’s win was a false start for China’s Long Jinbao in the final. If Long avoids the same mistake this time, it is likely to be an incredibly close event with a host of other names in the frame. The first day of canoe sprint finals features the men’s K4 500m (12:50). Four people in a boat, half a kilometre of flatwater paddling as fast as you can, go. A vastly experienced German crew won this event three years ago and remains largely intact this time around, swapping in relative youngster Jacob Schopf, 25. The other three, between them, have six Olympic and 17 world titles. Weightlifting’s men’s 73kg category could see a close battle between China’s Shi Zhiyong and Indonesia’s Rizki Juniansyah, who produced a stunning upset in April to beat team-mate Rahmat Erwin at a World Cup in Thailand and thereby take his place in the Indonesian team. Erwin is a two-time world champion who was expected to be one of the favourites in Paris. The event starts at 18:30. Expert knowledge  The women’s 10km open-water swim begins bright and early at 06:30. The venue? The River Seine. This has been a big talking point in the build-up to the Games, because the Seine’s water quality is a major concern – so much so that last year’s test event was cancelled as the water was too dirty. The French sports minister, Amelie Oudea-Castera, even had to take a symbolic dip in the Seine herself just days before the Games started in a bid to reassure people that the water will be safe. There is, however, reportedly a back-up plan. According to Reuters, officials have said the event could be moved to Paris 2024’s rowing and sprint canoeing venue “if all other contingency plans were exhausted"". Gold medal events: Athletics (women's 4x100m relay, women's shot put, men's 4x100m relay, women's 400m, men's triple jump, women's heptathlon, women's 10,000m, men's 400m hurdles), beach volleyball (women's), boxing (women's 50kg, women's 66kg, men's 71kg, men's 92kg), breaking (women's individual), canoe sprint (men's K2 500m, women's C1 200m, women's C2 500m, women's K2 500m), diving (women's 3m springboard), football (men's), hockey (women's), rhythmic gymnastics (individual all-around), sport climbing (men's boulder/lead), swimming (men's 10km marathon), table tennis (men's), taekwondo (men's 80kg, women's 67kg), track cycling (men's sprint medal, women's Madison), weightlifting (men's 89kg, women's 71kg), wrestling (men's freestyle 57kg, men's freestyle 86kg, women's freestyle 57kg). Highlights “You’ll never run alone,” a mural proclaims in Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s home city, Liverpool. Come the end of the heptathlon’s 800m (19:15), she will hope to be running alone for just a few seconds, at the front of the Olympic pack. Johnson-Thompson came sixth in Rio as she emerged from the shadow of London champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, then injury forced her out of Tokyo mid-event. She heads to Paris as the world champion, where she is up against Belgium’s Nafi Thiam, herself searching for a remarkable third consecutive heptathlon Olympic title. The men’s 4x100m relay final (18:45) is almost always the scene of triumph and disaster on a grand scale. In Tokyo, disaster for Britain arrived half a year after the event: the team, who won silver, were disqualified as a result of CJ Ujah testing positive for two banned substances. GB were fourth in last year’s world final, which was won by the US. Dina Asher-Smith is expected to lead the GB women’s sprint relay team if they reach their final at 18:30. Track cycling on Friday includes the women’s madison (final at 17:09), won by GB’s Katie Archibald and Laura Kenny on its introduction to the Games in Tokyo. Neither Archibald nor Kenny will be in Paris, but British duo Neah Evans and Elinor Barker are more than capable successors who won world gold last year. The men’s sprint (from 13:41) offers one of the most captivating tactical events in cycling, where contenders can almost end up at a standstill in a bid to catch the other off-guard before racing to the line. GB’s Jack Carlin has Olympic and world bronze in the event. The women’s hockey final is at 19:00. The Netherlands have only lost two of 35 outdoor internationals since the start of 2023 and are top of the world rankings by a mile. But as Belgium showed with a shock 2-1 win over the Dutch in June, that kind of form does not guarantee anything. GB, who beat the Netherlands for gold at Rio 2016 and finished third in Tokyo, come into this event ranked sixth in the world. Beach volleyball’s women’s tournament concludes next to the Eiffel Tower (21:30). Recently, this event has been the domain of the US and the duo of Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes will expect to keep it that way. Brazil’s Ana Patricia Ramos and Duda Santos Lisboa were on separate teams in Tokyo, where Brazil suffered the disappointment of neither team making it past the quarter-finals. They have won world gold and silver together since. Brit watch There are four boxing finals on Friday’s card from 20:30: men’s light middleweight and heavyweight alongside women’s light flyweight and welterweight. While GB have no nailed-on favourites heading into the Olympic boxing tournament, there is a lot of potential. Depending on previous days’ results, this might be a chance to see the likes of Rosie Eccles, Patrick Brown or Lewis Richardson in action. Ireland’s Aidan Walsh, a Tokyo bronze medallist, will hope to feature in the men’s light middleweight. Climbing’s men’s boulder and lead event has two finals from 09:15 to determine a winner. British teenager Toby Roberts goes up against the likes of Austria’s Jakob Schubert, a bronze medallist in a slightly different format three years ago and a formidable force in the more specialist world of lead climbing. Mejdi Schalck had been expected to be the hosts’ big hope, but he was defeated in qualifying, so France will be represented by Sam Avezou and Paul Jenft. While we saw Tom Daley in synchro diving action earlier, this time it is the turn of two other Britons in the individual 10m platform contest (prelims from 09:00). Noah Williams, a European silver medallist in 2022, is joined by Kyle Kothari. Meanwhile, Grace Reid and Yasmin Harper are GB’s representatives in the women’s 3m springboard (final from 14:00). The men’s marathon swim starts at 06:30. GB’s Hector Pardoe was a world bronze medallist earlier this year. World watch Brazil have been on every men’s football Olympic podium since 2008, winning the past two gold medals. Not this time. Brazil failed to even qualify for the Games, with the South American places going to Paraguay and Argentina. Will Spain add an Olympic title to their Euro 2024 glory? Or is this an opportunity for the hosts to win gold on home turf? The final is at 17:00. Who will be the Paris men's 400m hurdles champion? Norway’s Karsten Warholm is defending his Tokyo title and right up there with him are American Rai Benjamin and Brazil’s Alison dos Santos. Together, they are the fastest men in history in this event but it is rare to get all three racing each other at once. Will we see that tonight? The final is from 20:45. Rhythmic gymnastics’ individual all-around final takes place at 13:30. This is a sport where the near-total absence of Russian athletes at Paris 2024 will have a significant impact. Germany’s Darja Varfolomeev, who moved to the country from Russia in 2019, is the world champion. Expert knowledge  Breaking – also known as breakdancing, b-boying or b-girling – makes its Olympic debut on Friday. It has been a competitive sport since the 1990s. Here are some expressions to know. Top rock is everything you do standing up, down rock is everything you do on the floor and some of the most acrobatic elements are called power moves, which include things like whole-body spins. Each one-on-one competition is called a battle. Competitors take it in turns to perform for judges who are scoring for creativity, personality, technique, variety, performativity and musicality. The individual women’s final, or b-girls gold-medal battle, is at 20:23. Dutch teenager India Sardjoe is one to watch, as is Lithuania’s world and European champion Dominika Banevic, 17. Gold medal events: Artistic swimming (duet free routine), athletics (men's marathon, men's high jump, men's 800m, women's javelin throw, women's100m hurdles, men's 5000m, women's 1500m, men's 4x400m relay, women's 4x400m relay), basketball (men's), beach volleyball (men's), boxing (women's 57kg, women's 75kg, men's 57kg, men's +92kg), breaking (men's individual), canoe sprint (men's C1 1000m, men's K1 1000m, women's K1 500m), diving (10m platform), football (women's), golf (women's), handball (women's), modern pentathlon (men's), rhythmic gymnastics (group all-around), sport climbing (women's boulder/lead), table tennis (women's), taekwondo (men's +80kg, women's +67kg repechage), track cycling (men's Madison), volleyball (men's), water polo (women's), weightlifting (men's 102kg, women's 81kg, men's +102kg), wrestling (men's freestyle 74kg, men's freestyle 125kg, women's freestyle 62kg). Highlights Yes, you read that right, there are nearly 40 different gold medals being won on Saturday – the busiest day of Olympics action, by gold medals available, since September 30, 2000. All this action means the highlight is the entire day. Order in plenty of snacks and let’s give you a taste of what to look forward to. The women’s football final is at 16:00. There’s no Team GB, while Sweden, third-place finishers at last year’s World Cup, did not qualify either. The US, Canada, Spain, Germany and hosts France will all fancy their chances of being in this game. Laura Muir ran a British record in Tokyo to finish a second behind Olympic 1500m champion Faith Kipyegon of Kenya. Kipyegon should start the Paris final (19:25) as the favourite as she tries to win a third Olympic title in a row. Ethiopia’s Diribe Welteji and Birke Haylom could also be big factors, but Kipyegon has already broken her own world record once in Paris this summer – at the Diamond League in July. The final round of women’s golf begins at 08:00. The US should have a strong shot at this gold medal through either defending champion Nelly Korda or world number two Lilia Vu. South Korean duo Amy Yang and Ko Jin-young are also among the pre-tournament favourites. GB’s Georgia Hall and Charley Hull have both struggled with injury in the build-up to Paris. Ireland’s Michaela Walsh made history with brother Aidan when they became the first brother and sister to box at the same Olympics in Tokyo. Three years later, Michaela will be hoping she features in the women’s featherweight final at 20:30 after the disappointment of losing in the round of 16 last time. Team-mate and Commonwealth champion Jude Gallagher is an entrant in the men’s featherweight (final at 20:47). GB’s Delicious Orie, described by some as the next Anthony Joshua, is also a Commonwealth champion coming into the Paris super heavyweight category (final 21:51). Team GB won both modern pentathlon gold medals at Tokyo 2020. Joe Choong’s win was the first time a British man has won Olympic gold in a sport that combines fencing, swimming, showjumping, running and shooting. Choong has since won two world titles. The showjumping is at 16:30, followed in quick succession by fencing, swimming and the “laser run” biathlon-style finale. Brit watch After a fierce selection contest, Rebecca McGowan got the nod over three-time world champion Bianca Cook (nee Walkden) to represent GB in taekwondo’s +67kg category. European champion McGowan has come through ankle surgery and an ACL tear to be at the Olympics. “If I can get through that then I can get through four fights in Paris,” she said earlier this summer. (Round of 16 from 08:10, final at 20:39.) Track cycling’s men’s madison (16:59) is a tag-team points race: you and a partner do laps of the velodrome alongside a whole host of other teams. If you can gain a lap on everyone else, you get 20 points (a big deal). Every now and then, there is a sprint that will earn you bonus points. Most points wins. GB won silver on this event’s reintroduction to the Olympics three years ago, and the event is guaranteed televised chaos. In the men’s 800m at the athletics track, defending champion Emmanuel Korir is out, meaning there’s a chance Kenya may not win this event for the first time since 2004. Only a chance, mind you. Korir’s replacement, Emmanuel Wanyonyi, was a world silver medallist last year ahead of GB’s Ben Pattison, who will hope to make the start line for the Paris final (18:25) alongside team-mate Max Burgin. Sudan-born Marco Arop won that year’s world gold medal for Canada, while Algeria’s Djamel Sedjati has looked good this season. The men’s 10m platform diving final (14:00) is a chance for GB's Noah Williams or Kyle Kothari to pick up a first individual Olympic medal. It is almost impossible to keep China off the top of the podium in this event but it can happen – Australia’s Cassiel Rousseau, a circus performer when he was younger, took the world title in 2023. Molly Thompson-Smith was commentating on sport climbing during Tokyo 2020. Now she is on the GB team and hoping to feature in the women’s boulder and lead final from 09:15. Slovenia’s Janja Garnbret, who won the lone Olympic climbing title on offer to women three years ago, is again the one to beat. France will look to 19-year-old world silver medallist Oriane Bertone. World watch The men’s basketball final (20:30) is almost certain to feature the US. If it does not, that is one of the major shocks of the Games. Going back to 1936, there have been only three finals that did not feature the US – and one of those was a Games they boycotted. Why are they so dominant? Take a look at this year’s roster: LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are just three of the all-star names. The US have not missed out on this gold medal since 2004. Handball is a different story. The US have not qualified in men’s or women’s handball, other than as the host nation, since Barcelona 1992. The major powers here are nations like Spain and Denmark on the men’s side or Denmark and Norway on the women’s. More than anyone, though, France will be relishing the handball tournament in Paris: the hosts have the reigning Olympic women’s and men’s champions. With no Russian involvement this time, that might make more French medals even more likely. The women’s final starts at 14:00. In athletics, the 4x400m relays (from 20:12) extend the relay drama into four nail-biting laps of the Olympic track. The US look like hot favourites in the men’s event. The women’s event might be complicated by the relay first round taking place on Friday morning with the individual women’s 400m final that night. If that leads some nations to change their line-ups for the early relay session – to preserve a chance of winning an individual medal later that day – then we could see surprise qualifiers for the women’s relay final. Jamaica are always big relay contenders and GB won two world bronze medals last year. The men’s marathon starts at 07:00 as the Olympics uses one of its few remaining opportunities to milk every last drop of Paris scenery. Kenya’s two-time champion Eliud Kipchoge is one of the favourites in an event where many people will take time to remember the late Kelvin Kiptum, a compatriot of Kipchoge who broke the world record shortly before being killed in February when his car reportedly veered off the road and hit a tree. Men’s breaking gets its chance to shine (gold medal at 20:23). American Victor Montalvo, or b-boy Victor, was the 2023 world champion. Expert knowledge  Water polo reaches its women’s final at 14:35. If the US women make it this far, victory would make them the first team in water polo to win gold at four consecutive Olympics.

890,What's the problem with swimming in the Seine?,"It should be a stunning set piece of Paris 2024 - triathletes competing in the River Seine, bringing swimming back to the centre of this city. But concerns about water quality mean the first event has had to be postponed for a day.  Standing on the Pont des Invalides, slightly downstream of the planned starting line, locals and tourists spoke to me about whether they would be tempted to take a dip themselves. “It's a beautiful river,” said Reda, a Parisian, as he surveyed the Seine glimmering below on a hot July day.  “But I will never dive in, even if they clean it for years."" The Seine has already played a starring role in the Games, having hosted thousands of athletes who took part in a boat parade in Friday night’s rain-soaked opening ceremony. City swimming - which has been banned in the city for a century because of the water quality - is meant to be one of the major legacies of the Games, thanks to a major regeneration project. As recently as Monday, organisers were saying they were confident the triathlon events would go ahead as planned.  But the weekend's heavy rain has put paid to that.  Paris's ""single system"" drainage has become saturated, with excess water - from kitchens and toilets, as well as run-off from rain on the street - draining into the river.  Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo recently took a swim in the Seine to highlight the efforts made to clean it up.  Previous tests had showed persistent levels of E.coli that broke the limits imposed of sports federations. This type of bacteria can cause illnesses including vomiting and diarrhoea.  The BBC’s Hugh Schofield was among those who joined Ms Hidalgo. He accidentally swallowed a mouthful of water in the process - but remarked that it tasted fine. Many of the tourists I spoke to on the Invalides bridge spoke of the relative ease of open-water swimming at home. Visitors from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic all said they had dived into their respective countries’ rivers, lakes and canals – and that they would do the same in the Seine if the evidence suggested it was safe. “I would go for it,” said Dutchwoman Esmee. “It doesn’t look that bad from here.” France lags behind the European Union’s average score for top-quality bathing water conditions. About 75% of French bathing waters were rated “excellent” in 2023 compared with 85% across the bloc as a whole, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA). Although it was safe to bathe in most of the EU’s bathing waters, coastal waters were generally better than rivers and lakes, the agency noted in its report published in May. Cyprus topped the full table with 97.6% of its bathing waters being of excellent quality, followed by Austria at 96.9% and Croatia on 96.7%.   As the data just looks at the EU, the UK is not included. And whereas swimming is coming back to the Seine, currently only one stretch of the Thames - near Wallingford, Oxfordshire - is designated for bathing. The EEA made specific reference to Paris’s €1.4bn (£1.1bn; $1.5bn) clean-up operation, which began 10 years ago.  As part of this, a vast rainwater storage basin has been created. This is capable of storing the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water - all part of a mechanism to stop sewage flowing into the Seine during heavy rainfall. Not every visitor to the bridge on the eve of the men’s triathlon was fussed by the cleanliness issue, with some saying they would consider jumping into the river come what may – provided the weather was warm enough. One man from Brazil said that was simply what he and his compatriots did.  “In my city, São Paulo, it's not clean either,” he admitted. But a number of Parisians agreed that a clean and swimmable river would be an exciting part of the Olympic legacy. Danielle, a university professor, said she would “absolutely” swim in the Seine. “I have wanted to do it for a long time,” she said with a grin. For one man named Damien, maintaining the cleanliness was “a big project”, but one worth pursuing.  “It's a good opportunity for all Parisians,” he said. Testing of the water continues to be carried out daily.  Lambis Konstantinidis, operations director for Paris 2024, said there were several back-up plans in place, including the use of contingency days.  Downgrading the triathlons into duathlons - and scrapping the swimming entirely - would only be considered in a “really, really extreme case”, he told the BBC on Monday.

891,Is this the photo of the Paris 2024 Olympics?,"Gabriel Medina scored a 9.9 in Tahiti  French photographer Jerome Brouillet knew he had the chance of capturing something special when Brazilian surfer Gabriel Medina caught one of the day's biggest waves.  ""The conditions were perfect, the waves were taller than we expected,"" said Brouillet.  But what Brouillet found when he checked his camera was beyond his wildest dreams.  Waiting on a boat by the side of the wave in Tahiti, Brouillet was primed for the moment Medina 'kicked out' - when a surfer exits the wave at the end of their run. Medina emerged from the wave, pointing a finger in the air to celebrate his 9.9 score. At the perfect moment, Brouillet captured the Brazilian suspended in mid-air, as if stood on solid ground, as his board mimicked his stance.  ""He is at the back of the wave and I can't see him and then he pops up and I took four pictures and one of them was this one,"" said Brouillet. ""It was not hard to take the picture. It was more about anticipating the moment and where Gabriel will kick off the wave. ""I think that when he was in the tube he knew that he was in one of the biggest waves of the day. He is jumping out of the water like 'man, I think this is a 10'."" This video can not be played Surfer catches 'incredible' wave to set up viral photograph The picture, which immediately went through to Brouillet's editors, quickly resonated with people online. Brouillet, though, was unaware of just how popular the photo was proving to be until he checked his social media accounts.  ""I was just checking my phone on the six-minute break after the shoot and I had lots of notifications on social media and I thought something is happening with this shot,"" he said.  ""It's very cool, it's a nice shot and lots of people love it. It's not really a surf photograph so it captures the attention of more people."" Medina posted the image on his own Instagram account and the photo has already attracted more than 3.8m likes.

903,Bella Hadid shocked and upset over Adidas campaign,"US model Bella Hadid has spoken out after starring in an Adidas campaign which was criticised for what the brand called ""unintentional"" connections to the 1972 Munich Olympics. Hadid, who is half Palestinian, said:  ""I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign."" The advertising campaign for the retro trainers - the SL72s - referenced the 1972 Munich Olympics, which saw 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer killed in the attack by a Palestinian group called Black September. Adidas subsequently apologised and said it would ""revise"" its campaign, confirming to AFP that Hadid had been removed from it. Hadid, 27, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinians and earlier this year donated money to support relief efforts for the war in Gaza. ""I would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind,"" Hadid said in a statement shared on an Instagram story on Monday evening. ""In advance of the campaign release, I had no knowledge of the historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972.""  She continued: ""I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign. Had I been made aware, from the bottom of my heart, I would never have participated. ""My team should have known, Adidas should have known and I should have done more research so that I too would have known and understood, and spoken up."" The campaign released earlier this month saw Hadid holding a floral bouquet for the relaunch of the trainer which originally debuted in 1972,  the same year as the Munich Olympics. Hadid continued: ""While everyone's intentions were to make something positive, and bring people together through art, the collective lack of understanding from all parties undermined the process. ""I do not believe in hate in any form, including antisemitism. That will never waver, and I stand by that statement to the fullest extent. ""Connecting the liberation of the Palestinian people to an attack so tragic, is something that hurts my heart. ""Palestine is not synonymous with terrorism and this campaign unintentionally highlighted an event that does not represent who we are."" Hadid described herself as a ""proud Palestinian woman"". ""I will forever stand by my people of Palestine while continuing to advocate for a world free of antisemitism,"" she continued. ""Antisemitism has no place in the liberation of the Palestinian people. ""I will always stand for peace over violence, any day. Hate has no place here, and I will forever advocate for not only my people, but every person worldwide."" A previous statement from Adidas Originals shared on Instagram said connections to the 1972 attack were ""not meant"". The German company apologised ""for any upset or distress caused to communities around the world"". ""We made an unintentional mistake,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""revising the campaign"". When the ad was launched, it attracted criticism towards Hadid from some quarters, including on social media. But other users defended the model and called for a boycott of Adidas following the move to pull the campaign. The conflict in Gaza began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that more than 39,000 people have been killed in almost 10 months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants.",2024-07-30 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c035r104dg7o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
901,'He likes family': Trump defends running mate's cat lady slur,"Donald Trump on Monday defended his running mate's claims that ""childless cat ladies"" had destroyed American values, but also said he believed adults without children were just as good as parents.  JD Vance's 2021 comment that Vice-President Kamala Harris and other Democrats were ""a bunch of childless cat ladies miserable at their own lives"" resurfaced after Trump selected the Ohio senator as the Republican vice-presidential candidate. Trump said on Fox News on Monday that Mr Vance ""likes families"", but that he also said he did not place a higher value on parenting. ""You know, you don't meet the right person, or you don't meet any person. But you're just as good, in many cases, a lot better than a person that's in a family situation,"" he said.  Ms Harris, the presumptive Democrat candidate, has two stepchildren with her husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff.  Mr Emhoff's ex-wife has called such attacks ""baseless"" and described Harris as a ""loving, nurturing, fiercely protective"" co-parent. Trump said Mr Vance was simply trying to show how much he values family life. ""He grew up in a very interesting family situation, and he feels family is good. And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that,"" Trump said. ""All he said is he does... like I mean, for him, he likes family."" Asked by Fox News television host Laura Ingraham on Monday whether he could vouch for Mr Vance as an ""excellent pick"" for the November election, Trump said: ""He's got has tremendous support, and he really does among a certain group of people - people who like families."" ""That does not mean that people who aren't members of a big family... he's not against anything. He loves family, it's very important to him."" Trump's comments came as a 2021 interview of Mr Vance re-emerged, where he said that childless adults were ""more sociopathic"" than those with children. ""Having kids makes you a better person - I believe this deeply,"" he said on The Chris Buskirk Show.  ""The fact that so many people - especially in America's leadership class - just don't have that in their lives, you know I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less mentally stable.""  He later added that the ""most deranged"" and the ""most psychotic"" Twitter users were ""people who don't have kids"". A spokesman for Mr Vance said on Tuesday that he was ""was talking about politicians on the left who support policies that are explicitly anti-child and anti-family"". Mr Vance has also defended his original ""cat ladies"" remark, saying on Friday that it was ""obviously... a sarcastic comment"".  ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said,"" Mr Vance said on The Megyn Kelly Show. ""The substance of what I said, Megyn - I'm sorry, it's true,"" he added. Mr Vance, who has three children, said he was not criticising people who do not have children. ""This is about criticising the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-children,"" he told . ""I wish her step-children and Kamala Harris and her whole family the very best. The point is not that she’s lesser. The point is that her party has pursued a set of policies that are profoundly anti-child."" In the original interview with Tucker Carlson, Mr Vance questioned why some leading politicians did not have children. He named Ms Harris as an example. ""The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,"" he said at the time. ""How does it make any sense we've turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?"" He said the country was being run ""by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too"". Speaking to Fox News, Trump co-campaign chairman Chris LaCivita rejected any suggestion that Trump might regret his choice of running mate. ""JD was the best pick,"" Mr LaCivita said. ""The president loves him. We love him.""",2024-07-30 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg50ven1qeo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
899,DJ files complaint over opening ceremony abuse,"A French DJ who performed during the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony has filed a legal complaint after receiving abuse online.  Barbara Butch took part in a drag queen sequence during the event which sparked controversy as viewers interpreted it as a reference to The Last Supper The ceremony's artistic director, Thomas Jolly, denied this and some art experts said the scene shared more similarities with a painting of Greek gods.  A lawyer for Barbara Butch said the DJ ""has been threatened with death, torture and rape, and has also been the target of numerous antisemitic, homophobic, sexist and grossophobic insults"". Butch said she had been the target of ""cyber-harrassment"", adding that the messages she was receiving were ""increasingly extreme"". French authorities normally examine complaints before deciding whether to launch a formal police investigation.  Jolly has said that he was not inspired by The Last Supper, the famous Leonardo da Vinci painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles. Instead, he said the sequence, titled Festivity, was inspired by Greek mythology and intended to be a celebration of diversity, adding his intention was not to ""be subversive, nor to mock or to shock"".   Jolly added it was obvious that the tableau was not inspired by The Last Supper given the presence of a figure representing the Greek god Dionysus. But some viewers who interpreted it as a reference to the painting said they were offended by the similarities. French Catholic bishops said Christians had been hurt and offended by the show.  Butch wore a silver headdress which looked like a halo during her set, while surrounded by drag artists and dancers.  Organisers of the Paris Olympics have said there was ""never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group"" and that the intent was to ""celebrate community tolerance.""  In a statement, Butch's lawyer Audrey Msellati said she was filing several complaints.  ""Since the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games artist, DJ, and activist Barbara Butch has been the target of an in an extremely violent campaign of cyber-harassment and defamation,” Msellati said. “Barbara Butch condemns this vile hatred directed at her, what she represents and what she stands for."" Msellati continued: “She is today filing several complaints against these acts, whether committed by French nationals, or foreigners, and intends to prosecute anyone who tries to intimidate her in the future.” Butch also posted a statement of her own in Instagram stories, writing: ""Whatever some may say, I exist.  ""I’ve never been ashamed of who I am, and I take responsibility for everything – including my artistic choices. All my life, I’ve refused to be a victim: I won’t shut up."" She said that she “was extremely honoured” to perform in Friday’s ceremony and added: “My heart is still full of joy.” The scene also featured French drag queen Nicky Doll and former contestants from Drag Race France.",2024-07-30 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0xj358y7n5o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
909,Key questions answered after triathlon postponement,"Swimming has been banned in the River Seine since 1923 The Olympic men's individual triathlon at Paris 2024 was postponed on Tuesday after tests showed that water quality in the River Seine did not meet the acceptable standard.  With organisers now saying there is only a 60% chance that both the rescheduled men's event and women's race could take place on Wednesday, it only adds to the uncertainty around the event. BBC Sport looks at all the key questions around the triathlon and possible contingency plans. On Tuesday, organisers said E coli bacteria found on four points on the 1,500m course just under 24 hours before the postponement was the main area of concern. According to European standards, the safe limit for E coli is 900 colony-forming units (cfu) per 100ml. The four readings taken ranged from 980-1,553 cfu per 100ml. Between 17-23 July, data showed the river that bisects the French capital was suitable for swimming on six days out of seven. Unexpected adverse weather has proved problematic for organisers since, with heavy rainfall on the day of the opening ceremony raising pollution levels.  UK Government guidelines, external say that because of micro-organisms like E coli, open-water swimming can increase the risk of stomach bugs as well external infections, and could cause severe illness. '60% chance' triathlons take place on Wednesday What's happening and when at the Paris Olympics? Paris 2024 medal table Great Britain's Alex Yee is one of the favourites for gold in the men's race, while team-mate Beth Potter is the reigning women's world champion. On Tuesday, the postponement of the men's race was announced at 03:00 BST, four hours before the race was due to begin. Final tests of the water will be taken at 02:30 BST on Wednesday, before a decision is made on whether it is safe for swimming. The women's race is set to start at 07:00 BST (08:00 local time) on Wednesday, with the rearranged men's competition scheduled to begin at 09:45 (10:45 local time). To complicate matters further, Meteo-France - the French national weather and climate service - has forecast storms for Tuesday evening, light rain on Wednesday afternoon and more storms on Thursday. Organisers have said heavy rain previously caused levels of E coli and other bacteria in the Seine to rise. While there is hope that hot weather will help lower the bacteria count sufficiently for the competition to proceed, that may present another issue as the men's race is scheduled to head towards its conclusion during the hottest part of the day, when the temperature is forecast to reach 32C. If the triathlons do not go ahead on Wednesday, Friday remains a back-up date for both events. If the water quality is still not good enough by Friday, organisers have said the event could be contested as a duathlon - just the cycling and running legs - as a last resort. The triathlon made its Olympic debut in Sydney in 2000. The event features 1500m of swimming, a 40km bike ride and a 10km run to finish. While a mixed relay was added in Tokyo three years ago, there has never been a duathlon in the Olympics. Ordinarily that would consist of a 40km cycle and a 10km run. However, at the Paris Test Event in 2023, a duathlon format was trialled, with the swim replaced by an additional 5km run. While Olympic coaches and athletes are usually prepared for most eventualities, it is unlikely many training plans will have been tailored specifically for a duathlon. Commenting on World Triathlon's Instagram post, external announcing the postponement on Tuesday, Belgian triathlete Marten van Riel expressed his dissatisfaction with the situation. He wrote: ""If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago.  ""We are just puppets in a puppet show. Duathlon is no triathlon and changing the day like that in the middle of the night is disrespectful to the years of preparation of the athletes and to all (y)our fans that were going to watch live or on TV. What an appearance for triathlon on the biggest scene."" American competitor Seth Rider has been preparing for exposure to bacteria. ""We know that there's going to be some E coli exposure, so I just try to increase my E coli threshold by exposing myself to a bit of E coli in your day-to-day life,"" he said on Saturday. ""Just little things throughout your day, like not washing your hands after you go to the bathroom and stuff like this."" Locating the start of the triathlon at the Seine was considered a historic, albeit remarkable, decision. Critics may argue it was more about aesthetics, given swimming in the river has been prohibited for over 100 years because of its high levels of pollution and the risk of disease. However, French authorities have invested 1.4bn euros (£1.2bn) to make the Seine swimmable as a key legacy of the Games. That work includes the construction of a giant underground basin the size of a dozen Olympic swimming pools to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants. Despite that, levels of E coli were 10 times more than the acceptable level imposed by sports federations as recently as June. France currently lags behind the European Union’s average score, external for top-quality bathing water conditions.  British triathlete Vicky Holland, who took bronze at the Rio Games in 2016, told BBC Sport: ""This is something that is a huge deal, not just in our sport, but for the wider world as well.  ""There are less and less bodies of water in the world that are safe to swimmers and that's a real shame. It really highlights that we really need to try and clean up these bodies of water. I know that here with Paris, that is something they tried to do.  ""They spent a huge amount of money trying to clear up the Seine and they have done a really good job of it, it just quite hasn't meant the standard yet.""

910,GB retain relay title to win first swimming gold,"This video can not be played 'Absolutely brilliant!' - Team GB retain men's 4x200m freestyle relay gold medal Great Britain retained their Olympic 4x200m freestyle relay title in commanding fashion to secure the team's first swimming gold in Paris. After Adam Peaty and Matt Richards came agonisingly close with silvers, the same quartet that won in Tokyo - Richards, James Guy, Tom Dean and Duncan Scott - reunited to win in the cauldron of La Defense Arena. They had a slender lead going into the final leg but Scott, who was a cruel fourth in the individual event 24 hours earlier, brought the team home to win by a relatively comfortable 1.35 seconds. As the 27-year-old came down the final length, his fellow Scot Andy Murray prolonged his tennis career with another remarkable doubles victory in a special few moments for Team GB in Paris. After the medal ceremony, the Britons celebrated with their families in the stands - something they were unable to do during the Covid-19-impacted Games in 2021. ""It feels different for so many reasons but mostly because my family and friends are in the crowd,"" said Dean. ""That is the most special thing. ""It is all I have been thinking about since we won it in Tokyo, to do it again."" Victory made this the first time a British relay quartet have retained an Olympic title in swimming or athletics. It brought Team GB a fourth gold of the Games, taking their medal total to 12. Kieran Bird, who like Richards was born in England and swims for Wales, and Jack McMillan from Northern Ireland will also receive medals having filled in for Richards and Scott in the morning heats. Today's Olympics guide Full Paris Olympics schedule BBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule Men's freestyle is Britain's great strength in swimming. The winning quartet have all won world or Olympic gold in the individual 200m freestyle.  They are huge rivals for those solo places but also great friends and will all be present when Richards marries fellow GB swimmer Emily Large next month. With Richards - who earlier missed out on reaching the 100m freestyle final 90 minutes before the final - and Scott having gruelling schedules, they were rested for the heats but came in for the final two legs. Guy gave the team a flying start. He is supposedly the weakest freestyler but built a lead over American Luke Hobson, who won bronze in the individual event on Monday. With USA and France in the race, the noise levels were high. Dean - the 200m individual champion from 2021, who did not qualify here because of Richards and Scott - lost the lead momentarily but came strong in his final length. Richards stretched the lead again to hand Scott the advantage, and he was never going to be caught. ""There are so many great individuals in that team but when we come together it is so special,"" Scott said of the quartet, who also won World Championship gold in 2023. ""It fills you with confidence going up in the block with those guys. ""I am standing behind an Olympic champion, a world champion and a world champion. I'm thinking, 'I am in a pretty good place'."" Scott now has seven Olympic medals including two golds, with only former cyclists Sir Jason Kenny and Sir Bradley Wiggins ahead of him in terms of total medals on the British list. Dean now has three Olympic golds, and his fellow Englishman Guy - GB's ever-reliable relay specialist - has three golds and three silvers, all of them part of a quartet.

Home favourite Leon Marchand qualified for both the 200m breaststroke and 200m butterfly finals as he looks to add to his 400m medley gold. Both finals take place on Wednesday evening in what could be an epic session of swimming. Australia's Kaylee McKeown retained her 100m backstroke title, edging out American Regan Smith in one of the races billed as the best of this meet.

The 28-year-old hit 48 shots out of 50 to break the previous record of 43 and secure GB's first men's trap gold since 1968. ""I cannot quite believe it!"" Hales told BBC Sport. ""It is a dream come true and something I set out 10 years ago to achieve."" Hales' gold is Britain's third of the Paris Games and their 11th medal overall. China's Qi Ying claimed silver with 44 out of 50 while Guatemala's Jean Pierre Brol Cardenas clinched bronze. In qualifying, Olympic debutant Hales recorded a score of 123 out of 125 from five rounds to progress joint-first in the 30-man field. He now holds the world and Olympic records, having hit 49 out of 50 at last season's World Cup in Italy.

908,"GB's Reilly into BMX freestyle final, Worthington out","This video can not be played GB's Reilly qualifies in top spot for men's BMX freestyle final Great Britain's Kieran Reilly qualified in top spot for the men's BMX freestyle final but Charlotte Worthington missed out on the chance to defend her women's title after failing to progress in Paris. World champion Reilly scored 91.68 on his opening run then 90.75 on his second to give an average of 91.21 and qualify in top spot. Competing at his maiden Olympics, the 23-year-old laid down a marker on a scorching day in the French capital. Qualifying top of the standings means he will go last in the final and, as is often the case in BMX freestyle, there is a sense he is holding back something spectacular. Riders needed to finish in the top nine of 12 to qualify for Wednesday's showpiece at Place de la Concorde. Worthington did not make the cut after scoring 79.20 then 78.82 in her two runs for an average of 79.01 to finish 11th. ""It was super tough,"" she told BBC Sport. ""I was trying to ride it with the strengths that I have right now and that was a little bit out of my reach.""

Worthington has since opened up about her mental health issues and admitted she ""lost sight"" of what she loved about BMX in the years following her victory. Back on the stage where she made history, Worthington produced two smooth runs in front of a packed crowd but failed to wow the judges in the way she did in Japan.

919,Katie Ledecky makes history on epic night in the pool,"This video can not be played 'Absolute sensation!' - Marchand makes history with two gold medals in one night France's Leon Marchand created history in front of a wild home crowd with a golden double, while American Katie Ledecky won a record-equalling eighth Olympic gold medal on an epic night of swimming in Paris. In an remarkable, ear-splitting atmosphere, Marchand achieved the rare feat of winning two golds in the same swimming session. The 22-year-old first reeled in reigning champion and world record holder Kristof Milak of Hungary to win the 200m butterfly title and, less than two hours later, returned to the pool to cruise to victory in the 200m breaststroke and secure his third gold of the Games. No-one had previously completed the men's 200m butterfly-breaststroke double and Marchand won both in Olympic-record times. In becoming the first swimmer to win two individual golds in one night at the Olympics since 1976, the poster boy of these Games cemented himself as a global superstar of the sport. ""When you talk of Michael Phelps, when you talk of Ian Thorpe, you are now going to have to talk about Leon Marchand because that is one of the best things I think we have ever seen,"" British Olympic champion Adrian Moorhouse said on BBC TV. Earlier, 27-year-old Ledecky, who achieved such iconic status long ago, dominated her rivals to retain her 1500m freestyle title in an Olympic record time - and equal compatriot Jenny Thompson as the most successful female swimmer in Games history. It was Ledecky's 12th medal overall, which gave her an identical record to Thompson, whose haul of eight golds, three silvers and one bronze came between 1992 and 2004. And, to cap off a stunning session of swimming, Pan Zhanle of China won the 100m freestyle in a world record time of 46.40 seconds, refusing to be forgotten in what is usually the sport's blue-riband event. Today's Olympics guide Full Paris Olympics schedule BBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule This video can not be played French commentators react to Leon Marchand's 200m butterfly victory The 15,000-capacity indoor arena has already been dubbed the loudest and best swimming venue in recent memory. Tickets to see Marchand, from Toulouse, have been the hottest property in town. This, though, was something else -  each of Marchand's strokes in the breaststroke leg met with huge roars of ""Allez"" by a crowd who had turned up with flags, horns and masks of their hero. His first victory, in a time of one minute 51.71 seconds, was gripping. He trailed by almost a body length at the final turn but overhauled Milak, regarded as the greatest butterfly racer in history, in the final strokes with the crowd on its feet. Marchand had his first medal ceremony before his next final but, rather than joining Milak and bronze medallist Ilya Kharun of Canada on a lap of honour, he disappeared quickly to recover. He then completed a pure procession, winning in 2:05.85 to beat Australia's defending champion Zac Stubblety-Cook by almost a second, and the praise soon poured in on social media.  French president Emmanuel Macron labelled him the ""merchant of dreams"" and a ""legend"", while World Cup-winning footballer Antoine Griezmann called Marchand the ""Little Prince of the Pool"". Marchand has been the rising star of swimming since sending US great Phelps' former coach Bob Bowman a letter, asking to be taken under his wing – a request duly accepted by the much-revered American. Last year Marchand, known in Japan as 'the new monster', broke Phelps' last remaining world record in the 400m medley which confirmed his status as an elite all-rounder. He won the 400m medley title here on Sunday too, but in these wins on Wednesday, for which the schedule was altered to allow him the chance of further glory, he beat specialists of their stroke. ""A double Olympic champion in one session - not even Michael Phelps tried that,"" said BBC commentator and former Olympic swimmer Andy Jameson. ""The audacity. I cannot believe he even tried it, never mind won them both."" The night ended with a final rendition of the French national anthem but it felt like the party would go on long into the night. Marchand will have a day off on Thursday before returning for his fourth event on Friday - the 200m medley, where he will compete against Britain's Tom Dean and Duncan Scott. Ledecky, who has revolutionised distance swimming, was seven seconds quicker than Tokyo, leading to belief the American is, somehow, getting even better. When she won in Paris with a time of 15 minutes 30.02 seconds there was not another swimmer in sight on the TV pictures. Ledecky won her first gold at London 2012 as a 15-year-old and followed with four more in Rio de Janeiro, before another two in Tokyo. Only Phelps has won more swimming golds than her. The 27-year-old will also compete in the 800m freestyle on Friday, an event in which she is the three-time Olympic champion and world record holder. Another victory would mean Ledecky equals the record of gymnast Larisa Latynina – the most successful female Olympian in any sport. She won nine golds for the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s.",2024-07-31 23:09:57,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cw0yvx14nl4o,Matthew Henry,2024-07-31 23:09:57,,True
935,Five top contenders emerge in Harris VP hunt,"Kamala Harris will begin a US tour with her new running mate next week, indicating that she may unveil her choice by Monday. The pool of candidates for Democratic vice-president has been narrowed to a group of five, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner. A decision is required before the Democratic National Convention, which starts on 19 August in Chicago. The presidential election is in November.   Once Ms Harris's running mate is announced, the two are expected to tour the battleground states.   Here is a look at the five finalists, according to CBS.  This charismatic and popular governor could help Ms Harris capture Pennsylvania - a must-win for Democrats. Mr Shapiro, 51, has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 and has made inroads for Democrats in a swing state that went to Trump in the 2016 election.  He captured national headlines after quickly working to rebuild a collapsed bridge on a pivotal Philadelphia highway last year. The speedy repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate. He would be the first Jewish vice-president if chosen by Ms Harris and the Democratic ticket proves victorious.  Mr Shapiro voiced strong support for Israel in the war in Gaza and his criticism of student protests on school campuses in his state could be divisive in the Democratic party and the race for office. Vulnerabilities: Public education advocates have pointed to Mr Shapiro's support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as a potential weakness of Mr Shapiro's.  In mid-July, a group of over two dozen pro-public school groups sent a letter to Ms Harris in which they urged her to pick another candidate who is ""wholly committed to our nation's public education system"".  The swing-state senator has an impressive resume that could appeal to voters on both sides of the aisle.  The former Navy combat pilot and Nasa astronaut has spent more than 50 days in space on multiple missions.  But Mr Kelly, 60, is newer to serving in Washington. He was sworn into office in December 2020.  His wife is Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head 2011 in Arizona while serving in the House of Representatives.   Ms Giffords has since become one of the leading voices on gun safety laws, and the couple's personal story could resonate with voters. Mr Kelly's strong border stance and occasional criticisms of the Biden administration could help appeal to independent and conservative voters.   If chosen, the party would need to fill his Senate vacancy in a key state.  Vulnerabilities: Mr Kelly has already come under some criticism for his role founding World View, a company specialised in high-altitude stratospheric balloons.  The firm received early venture capital funding from Chinese tech giant Tencent, although the company says it has ""zero access, zero input and zero control"" over it. Mr Kelly stepped away from the company in 2019, although he still has a financial stake in it through a blind trust.  The Democratic governor has been close to Ms Harris for a long time.  Mr Beshear, 46, has been able to carve out a successful career as a Democrat in a state that Donald Trump carried by 20 points in the last election. It is an appealing characteristic that could sweeten the Democratic ticket.  He has given a number of viral interviews criticising Donald Trump's vice-presidential choice, JD Vance, and his opinions on the Appalachia region.  ""He ain't from here,"" Mr Beshear has said of the freshman Ohio senator in interviews on CNN and MSNBC. He has called Mr Vance a ""phony"" and ""fake"" for his descriptions of the region and its residents in his book, Hillbilly Elegy.  ""This is a guy that used to come a couple weeks a summer, at best, to Kentucky and then wrote a book claiming to know us, claiming to understand our culture,"" Mr Beshear told the Des Moines Register.  ""He called my people lazy, and these are the coal miners that built this country.” Mr Beshear often professes his Christian faith and its impact on his personality and work. Supporting public education and protecting abortion access are also key issues for him. Vulnerabilities: In 2023, Mr Beshear drew the ire of some Kentucky Republicans for his veto of a law that banned transgender surgery or drugs involving children. The state's general assembly ultimately overrode his veto and enacted the law.  Mr Walz is a battle-tested leader who served 12 years in Congress before becoming governor in 2018.  He has gained national attention for his strategy calling Donald Trump and JD Vance ""weird"". The phrase caught on with a number of Democrats - including Ms Harris. ""He's just a strange, weird dude,"" Mr Walz said of Trump during a fundraising event on Monday.  His plainspoken and small-town Midwestern persona could appeal to independent and conservative voters.  The 60-year-old led Minnesota through the 2020 protests over George Floyd's death in Minneapolis He deployed the National Guard to help quell riots that broke out during the demonstrations.  Mr Walz served 20 years in the National Guard, taught high school and also worked as an assistant football coach. Minnesota is arguably less of a swing state, but would be a valuable asset for Ms Harris.  Vulnerabilities: Mr Walz's political foes have criticised his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 protests, with Minnesota GOP chairman David Hann recently telling Fox that he believes Mr Walz ""was fearful of alienating his progressive base"" with a more forceful response.  Campaigning for the White House would not be new for Mr Buttigieg.  As mayor of South Bend, Indiana, he was a surprise favourite of liberal voters in his failed 2020 Democratic primary campaign.  Since then, he has served as federal Transportation Secretary and has become arguably one of the White House's best communicators.  His skill in interviews and before crowds has been on full display in recent weeks as Ms Harris closes in on a running mate.  On the television show Real Time with Bill Maher, he took multiple shots at Mr Vance. Mr Buttigieg said he ""knows"" a lot of people like Mr Vance, who ""would say whatever they needed to"" in order to get ahead.  Mr Buttigieg, 42, pointed out Mr Vance's history of fiercely criticising Trump and how he's now changed his tune to ""get power"".  He also managed a number of public crises in his role as secretary, helping to oversee the response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022. Vulnerabilities:  Some Republicans have criticised Mr Buttigieg for his handling of his role as transportation secretary, saying he took too long to go to East Palestine and has been ineffective when addressing problems facing the US aviation sector.  Conservatives also assailed Mr Buttigieg in 2021 for taking two months' parental leave during a supply-chain crisis.",2024-07-31 23:09:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce4q832w7dgo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
937,Kari Lake wins Republican Senate primary in Arizona,"Former Arizona candidate for governor, Kari Lake, has won the state's Republican Senate nomination, setting the vocal Trump ally up for a potentially tight race against Democrat Ruben Gallego.  Ms Lake, 54, faced unexpectedly stiff competition from Republican sheriff Mark Lamb, with some analysts suggesting that she faces an uphill battle with moderate voters.  Mr Gallego, a US representative and former Marine, ran unopposed in the Democratic party's primary.  The winner of November's race will replace independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who announced in March she would not seek re-election.  Final results from Tuesday's primary election are still being calculated and could take a few days.  In an acceptance speech on Tuesday night, Ms Lake referred to Trump as a ""hero"", who needs help in Washington DC.  ""He can't do this alone,"" the former TV anchor said. ""I'm going to be his back-up.""  Ms Lake's primary opponent, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, had sought to position himself as the best candidate to secure Arizona's border with Mexico and win in a general election.  While Ms Lake raised substantially more money in her campaign - $10.3m (£8m) compared to Mr Lamb's $2m - the sheriff secured about 40% of the vote.  Some analysts have pointed to the unexpectedly close race as a sign that Ms Lake may have alienated Republican voters with her unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud tipping the 2020 election.  ""Lake's underwhelming numbers are a bad sign for her general election,"" Republican consultant Tyler Montague was quoted as saying in the Arizona Republic newspaper.  In her victory speech, Ms Lake called on Republicans from ""all walks of life"" to unite behind her in November's election, which she referred to as a ""battle between good and evil"" against ""people who want to destroy this country"". Once Ms Lake's victory became clear, Arizona's Democratic Senatorial Campaign launched an ad in which they referred to her as a ""power-hungry liar"". The ad includes clips of Ms Lake saying that abortion pills should not be legal.  “It’s official – my opponent is Kari Lake,"" Mr Gallego tweeted. ""Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.” The race for Arizona's Senate seat will be closely watched nationally, with Democrats needing to keep control of it in order to maintain a narrow 51 to 49 majority in the 100-member chamber.

946,History maker Fox seals 'magical' golden double in Paris,"This video can not be played Fox wins C-1 slalom canoeing gold At one point, Jessica Fox could have been forgiven for thinking she would never win Olympic gold. But the Australian canoeist has now won her past three Olympic finals, rewritten Games history and will bid for an unprecedented treble at Paris 2024 later this week. Fox, 30, was born in France and has lit up the canoe slalom on her return, proving a class above her rivals at the spectacular Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. On Wednesday she retained her canoe single (C1) title in style, storming down the course to claim victory by 2.48 seconds ahead of Germany's faultless Elena Lilik -  despite incurring two penalty seconds for making contact with a gate. That came just three days after her kayak single (K1) triumph, which ended a long, agonising wait for gold in that event. In her first three Olympic finals, Fox missed out on gold by a combined six seconds in an unforgiving sport determined by the finest margins. But in Paris, she has made history as the first athlete to win two canoe slalom gold medals at the same Games. Her sixth Olympic podium is unmatched in the sport. Fox has also become the most successful athlete in Australian Olympic history with her sixth individual medal, surpassing swimmers Ian Thorpe and Leisel Jones, cyclist Anna Meares and runner Shirley Strickland on an esteemed list. ""This has been a dream Games,"" Fox said. ""As an athlete, you put in the blood, sweat and tears, and the team invests in you. For it to come down to one day every four years, then to actually pull it off, is the best feeling in the world.  ""It does not always go your way and I have experienced that as well. For it to turn out this way, it has been the perfect Games and so magical to be here in Paris."" Fox's father Richard competed for Great Britain, winning five K1 world titles, while her mother Myriam won Olympic and world K1 medals for France. Her own Olympic journey began when she demonstrated her talent by winning K1 silver as an 18-year-old at London 2012, but she had to settle for successive bronze medals in that event in 2016 and 2020. Picking herself up after that painful third successive near-miss in Tokyo was, according to Fox, ""the hardest thing I've probably ever done"". But it has proven pivotal in her story. Just two days later, the eight-time individual world champion returned to win the inaugural women's C1 Olympic title - a glorious breakthrough moment which has only paved the way for more. With history made, and her legacy firmly established, Fox will now prepare for the chaotic and unpredictable kayak cross event, which begins with a time trial round on Friday, 2 August. Chasing a remarkable treble, Fox admits in that event - making its Olympic debut in Paris - ""you just never know"" what will happen. As for beyond that race and into the future, Fox - at the peak of her powers - does not sound like she is done yet, either. ""I still have another race so it's not over yet,"" she said, when asked about her thoughts on a post-Games retirement. ""I still feel good, I still love the sport and I'm still enjoying it. ""And we have the World Championships at home in 2025.""

The Bright Stars, 33rd in the world rankings, were no match for the 16-time champions and were defeated 103-86 at the Pierre Mauroy Stadium. USA led from the first quarter and never looked back, with Miami Heat's Bam Adebayo registering a team-high 18 points and seven rebounds. For South Sudan, Nuni Omot led the way with a game-high 24 points. But although entertaining, this match was by no means as dramatic as when the two nations met earlier this month for an Olympic warm-up game. The United States had to come from 16 points down that night to avoid one of the biggest shocks in basketball history as they edged a 101-100 victory in London.  The USA are top of Group C with four points This win never really looked in doubt. Team USA features 12 NBA All-Stars, four NBA MVPs and six NBA champions, who combined have 11 Olympic appearances and own 10 gold medals. They will round-up their Group C qualifiers by playing Puerto Rico on Saturday, while South Sudan will have to get a result against Serbia in order to progress.

943,GB win rowing gold in astonishing photo finish,"This video can not be played Team GB come back to win gold in the women's quad sculls Great Britain's rowers won a dramatic Olympic gold in the women's quadruple sculls after a photo finish with the Netherlands.  The Dutch led from the front and were half a boat length clear with 200m to go before an astonishing push from GB pipped them at the line.  England's Lauren Henry, Lola Anderson and Georgina Brayshaw and Northern Ireland's Hannah Scott won in six minutes 16.31 seconds, with the Netherlands 0.15 seconds behind them. After an anxious wait for the winner to be announced, the four collapsed into each other's arms in scenes of jubilation and pure exhaustion as they added Olympic gold to their 2023 world title success. ""I still can't quite believe it,"" Scott told BBC One. ""We kept it so cool to the end. We had the confidence, we know we've done so many hard miles in training. The immensity of it hasn't caught up with me yet."" Henry, at 22 the youngest member of the crew, had urged her team-mates to mount one last big effort, telling them: ""We are going now, we need to go now."" ""I'd felt we'd won it because I sensed I was ahead of the Dutch bow girl,"" she said. ""But it wasn't until I looked at the big screen and saw 'GBR 1' that I believed it. That moment was just ecstatic."" After a disappointing campaign in Tokyo without any golds, the triumph signifies what Team GB's rowers hope will be the start of a return to form. GB's men finished fourth in the same event with the Netherlands successfully defending their title from Tokyo.  Tom Barras was the only remaining rower from the GB team that won silver in 2021, with Callum Dixon, Matthew Haywood and Graeme Thomas completing the quartet that finished almost two seconds behind Poland in third, with Italy claiming silver.  This video can not be played Emotional Anderson and Scott interview after winning gold It is the first time Team GB have won the quadruple sculls in the Olympics and is the latest emotional instalment in the lives of some of the quartet.  After Helen Glover and Heather Stanning claimed gold in the women's pair at London 2012, a young Anderson wrote on a piece of paper: ""My name is Lola Anderson and I think it would be my biggest dream in life to go to the Olympics in rowing and if possible win a gold for GB.""  She then threw it away, but without her knowledge her father Don - a former rower - retrieved it. He kept it for seven years and, when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, wanted to remind her of her dreams. ""I know that he would be so proud of me,"" a tearful Anderson said after receiving her medal. ""I am thinking about him a lot right now. ""It's quite overwhelming to be experiencing this but I am so grateful. ""I threw it away because I didn't believe. I was 13 at the time, so why would you believe that?"" Anderson, 26, added the diary entry was as valuable to her as an Olympic gold medal. ""I always get a bit nervous taking it anywhere with me,"" she said. ""What happens if a suitcase gets lost, or something like that? ""It's a piece of paper but it's the most valuable thing I have, maybe joint with this [gold medal] now. It's safe in a tin with all my dad's old medals."" Scott, from Coleraine, was also inspired by London 2012 success while Brayshaw overcame the odds of a traumatic horse-riding accident when she was 15 to reach the pinnacle of her sport.  She was told her injuries would be ""life-changing"" by doctors, only to recover through extensive rehabilitation and physiotherapy. ""I believed in all of the girls. I still can't believe it. We've worked on this for three years. It has left me quite speechless,"" Brayshaw told BBC One.  Scott added: ""We've all had personal journeys to how we've got here. It's not been easy and there's been a lot of setbacks in each individual's story. ""It just shows that you've got to persevere, learn from those experiences and use them as positives."" Germany claimed bronze while defending champions China finished sixth. Meanwhile, gold-medal favourites Emily Craig and Imogen Grant progressed to  Friday's final of the lightweight women's double sculls. Ollie Wynne-Griffith and Tom George claimed second place in their pairs semi-final to reach the final on Friday, while Ireland's Ross Corrigan and Nathan Timoney also made it through with a third-place finish.

Marta, who will retire from international football this year, was sent off for narrowly missing Olga Carmona's head with a dangerous high-footed tackle during the Group C match in Bordeaux.  Her hopes of appearing again in the tournament now rest on whether Brazil make it through their quarter-final tie against hosts France, after the Selecao advanced as one of the best third-placed sides. Brazil were level when Marta was sent off just before half-time, with Spain, scoring in the 68th minute and then the 17th minute of second-half injury time - an extension prompted by multiple injury delays - to maintain their 100% record. Marta, 38, won Olympic silver at Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008, losing to the United States on both occasions.

953,Biles at brilliant best as curtain comes down on Murray's career,"Simone Biles has now won six Olympic gold medals Simone Biles was at her brilliant best to recapture her all-around gymnastics crown as Andy Murray’s glittering tennis career came to an end on day six of the Paris Olympics. American Biles, 27, became the oldest winner of her sport's blue-riband event for 72 years and just the third woman to win two all-around Olympic titles after Vera Caslavska and Larisa Latynina. Murray, 37, one of Britain's sporting greats, was unable to deliver a medal-winning swansong as he and Dan Evans lost 6-2 6-4 to US pair Tommy Paul and Taylor Fritz in the men's doubles quarter-finals. Earlier on Thursday, Team GB missed out on the rowing gold they craved but added three more medals at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. It keeps GB on track to better the haul of Tokyo three years ago, where they had 18 by the same stage on day six. Helen Glover, Esme Booth, Sam Redgrave and Rebecca Shorten took silver in a thrilling women's four race after being edged out by just 0.18 seconds by the Netherlands. Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne and Becky Wilde earlier clinched bronze in the women's doubles sculls, while Oli Wilkes, David Ambler, Matt Aldridge and Freddie Davidson also claimed bronze in the men's four. But there was disappointment for British 800m medal hope Jake Wightman, who has withdrawn from the Games because of a hamstring injury. Widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time, Biles made history as the first women to reclaim the Olympic all-around title, having first won it in 2016 at the Rio Games. Despite pulling out of most of her events at Tokyo 2020 after experiencing the 'twisties' - a disorientating mental block - she was already the most decorated gymnast coming into the Paris Games. And she underlined her enduring excellence in a gruelling sport that has traditionally been dominated by teenagers. An electrifying display got under way with a sensational vault that scored 15.766 and while there was a rare mistake on the uneven bars, she did not put a foot wrong thereafter.  She concluded with a peerless floor routine to take gold well ahead of Brazil's silver medallist Rebeca Andrade and defending champion Sunisa Lee, who took bronze. Biles now has as many Olympic medals as the great Nadia Comaneci and her tally of 39 at world and Olympics level is unparalleled in the sport.  And with floor, beam and vault finals in the coming days she could yet add to her collection.

How to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBC Paris 2024: What you can expect to watch on Thursday Having staved off retirement with the help of Evans in the first two rounds against Japan's Taro Daniel and Kei Nishikori and Belgium's Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen, there was to be no fairytale ending to Murray's 19-year professional career at Roland Garros. Fritz and Paul's non-existent celebrations, rapturous applause and well wishes only emphasised the respect and admiration that Murray has earned as a giant of the modern game. While Murray has been ravaged by injuries in recent years, he famously ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion at Wimbledon when he defeated Novak Djokovic in 2013. He added a second title in 2016, taking his career majors total to three after breaking his duck at the 2012 US Open. Murray also won gold at the 2012 Olympics on an emotional day at the All England Club when he defeated Roger Federer just weeks after he had lost the Wimbledon final to the Swiss on the same Centre Court. And four years on, he beat Juan Martin del Potro to become the first player, male or female, to win two Olympic singles golds. Murray, who won 46 titles in all, also led Britain to the Davis Cup title in 2015, the country's first in 79 years. This video can not be played 'Icon' Andy Murray's tennis career over after doubles defeat This video can not be played Glover and women's four pipped to Olympic gold Glover's bid to become the first woman to win three Olympic rowing gold medals for GB came up agonisingly short as the women's four were pipped to the title by the Netherlands. At 38, and having twice previously retired from the sport, mother-of-three Glover’s legacy as a GB Olympic great was already cemented following gold-medal success at London 2012 and in Rio four years later. But there was a sense that the quartet of Glover, Booth, Redgrave and Shorten were the favourites for this event in Paris. Instead, it proved almost a reverse of Wednesday’s dramatic finish in the water, when GB women’s quadruple scullers edged the Dutch to gold right at the finish. ""We put it all out there,"" said Glover. ""We raced the plan we wanted to race, we raced together.  ""We raced with so much heart and I think there can't be regret at looking back and not thinking you did all you can."" This video can not be played Hodgkins-Byrne and Wilde win double sculls bronze Glover was the first mother to row for Team GB at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. She has paved the way for others, including Hodgkins-Byrne, who produced a stirring performance alongside Wilde to take bronze in the women's doubles sculls. Hodgkins-Byrne took time away after Tokyo 2020 to give birth to son Freddie, while Wilde has an inspiring story of her own having started out as a swimmer who only switched sports in 2017. The Olympics is just her third international event after needing surgery on her forearms last September, but just 10 months on, and having only recently teamed up with Hodgkins-Byrne, the pair earned a surprise spot on the podium behind champions New Zealand and silver medallists Romania. The men's four of Wilkes, Ambler, Aldridge and Davidson followed up with another bronze to bring GB's total to four rowing medals in Paris, already one more than they managed at Tokyo 2020.

The 25-year-old - who received a bye in the first round - is one of two athletes who have been cleared to compete in the women's boxing in Paris, having been disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said welterweight Khelif was disqualified in India because of elevated levels of testosterone. It added that all boxers in Paris ""comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations"". ""It could have been the match of a lifetime, but I had to preserve my life as well in that moment,"" said Carini, who was in tears as she faced the media after the bout. Khelif, who has lost nine times during her 50-fight career, told BBC Sport: ""I'm here for the gold - I fight everybody.""

Japan's Hideki Matsuyama is the clubhouse leader at eight under. Given the tragic events in his hometown of Southport, where three young girls died after a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed event on Monday, Fleetwood's thoughts this week have been with the families and those affected. ""When one of you gets hurt, you feel like all of you do. That's just what home is,"" said the 33-year-old. ""Everybody is feeling it, for sure, but nobody as much as the families that are involved and that's what comes first. ""We all follow our dreams, whatever it is, and that's obviously a huge part of life but for those kids that won't have the chance and those families that have got to deal with it, it massively puts things into perspective.""

950,Biden burnishes his legacy with historic  prisoner swap,"Last month, President Joe Biden said that he had “no higher priority” than gaining the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. On Thursday, after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, arm-twisting and manoeuvring, he accomplished that task. The multilateral exchange of 24 prisoners with Russia – the largest such swap since the Cold War – represents a significant feather in the cap of a man who abandoned his re-election bid less than two weeks ago. Like many in the waning days of their White House tenures, Mr Biden has found that foreign policy is one area where a president, even when sidelined from electoral politics, can make a splash. Typically, this focus abroad occurs at the end of a second term, when the incumbent is unburdened by a re-election campaign and domestic attention is on the party's new nominee. Mr Biden's circumstances are unusual. The nearest historical parallel in the modern era is when President Lyndon Baines Johnson stood down his re-election bid because of growing discontent with his handling of the Vietnam War. That war dominated Mr Johnson's final months in office – and represented his political undoing.  Mr Biden, on the other hand, has been able to take a victory lap with this prisoner swap, basking in the joy of families of the released Americans at the White House on Thursday, after more than a month of personal and political turmoil. Mr Biden's month of turmoil, which began with a catastrophic debate performance in late June, culminated in last week's Oval Office address to the nation, where he discussed his decision to drop his re-election campaign. While he conceded that it was time to ""pass the torch"", his speech included a reminder that his presidential term wasn’t over and that his work wasn't done. It came with a heavy serving of foreign policy promises. He said he would bring home detained Americans - which Thursday’s news significantly advanced. He also pledged to continue to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders - which recent congressional funding has guaranteed well into next year. And he said he would work to end the war in Gaza ""and bring peace and security to the Middle East"". On that last item, the news has been trending from bad to worse in recent days. Tensions in the Middle East have been escalating dramatically. Israel was allegedly behind the assassination of a prominent Hamas political leader in Iran on Wednesday.  The chances of a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah have grown, as the two sides exchanged attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border. An Israeli strike on Tuesday killed a senior Hezbollah leader, as well as an Iranian military advisor. The US State Department has warned American citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon – reflecting the growing concern of a widening regional conflict. Mr Biden, who once chaired the Senate Foreign Relations committee and oversaw an international portfolio as Barack Obama's vice-president, touted his foreign policy chops as he campaigned for president in 2020. But the Middle East has proven to be a diplomatic graveyard for even the most capable US foreign policy hands. While achieving the kind of lasting ""peace and security"" Mr Biden envisions would become a remarkable accomplishment, it seems as far off now as any point since the war began nearly 10 months ago. While foreign policy successes could bolster Mr Biden's legacy, the president's place in the history books – and, in particular, how he is viewed by his members of his own party – hinges most directly on the fate of his chosen successor. Although Kamala Harris was not with the president at the White House on Thursday afternoon, she is scheduled to join the president in greeting the newly released prisoners when they first return to US soil later in the evening. The White House also has been quick to credit the vice-president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, for playing a key role in negotiating details of the complex multilateral prisoner exchange with US allies. A senior Biden administration official told the BBC that Ms Harris' February meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Robert Golob of Slovenia at the Munich Security Conference were particularly crucial. Meanwhile, the Republican presidential ticket has quickly attempted to minimise any political benefits from the prisoner swap – both by taking credit for it and by questioning its wisdom. During a rally in Arizona, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance said that the exchange was really a reflection of what he said was the increasing likelihood that Donald Trump would win in November. ""There's a real sense that the world leaders are afraid that if Donald Trump comes in, they’re going to have to start behaving again,"" he said. ""The bad guys worry that Donald Trump will be back and the free ride is over.” The former president himself posted a lengthy response on his social media website, questioning Mr Biden’s negotiating strategy and speculating about the details of the exchange. ""We never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps,"" he wrote. ""Our 'negotiators' are always an embarrassment to us!"" The Russian asking price for the release of Mr Gershkovich and Mr Whelan - along with Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and a group of Russian dissidents - was unquestionably high. It included Russian intelligence agents convicted of an assassination and espionage. But the president and his senior staff, in their remarks on Thursday, said the deal was worth it. Mr Biden also took a moment  to tout his foreign policy vision in what could be an implied contrast with the former president's ""America first"", go-it-alone international outlook. ""Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world and friends you can trust, work with and depend upon, especially on matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this,"" he said. ""Our alliances make our people safer."" It was a pointed message from a president whose opportunities to pull the national spotlight his way – and to burnish his legacy – are diminishing as the final days of his presidency tick away.",2024-08-01 23:09:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1e1ygx7r1o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
972,US border migrant crossings fall for fifth month in a row,"The number of unlawful crossings by migrants at the US southern border has dropped for the fifth consecutive month, according to official data. US Border Patrol agents apprehended around 57,000 migrants along the border in July - the lowest recorded since September 2020.  The numbers are down significantly from December, when around 250,000 migrants were caught crossing the border. President Joe Biden's administration has credited the decrease to recent actions by him to tackle illegal immigration into the US, an election-year political vulnerability for the Democrats. ""This is the product of a number of actions this administration has taken,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in an interview with CBS this week. Mr Mayorkas said those actions include an executive order signed last month by President Joe Biden that allows US immigration officials to deport migrants without processing their asylum claims. The measure has been called one of the most restrictive border policies by a Democratic president in recent times, and was criticised by left-wing members of the party. At the time, the president vowed that his executive order would ""help us gain control of our border"". He added that ""doing nothing is not an option"". Government data shows that the number of migrants stopped at the US-Mexico border had dropped even before the order. Border Patrol recorded 141,000 apprehensions in February, 137,000 in March, 129,000 in April, 118,000 in May and 84,000 in June. The figures do not include official border crossings, where the Biden administration has been processing around 1,500 migrants each day through a smartphone app that schedules appointments between migrants and US border agents. On the other side of the border, Mexican officials have also been working to curb illegal migration, including stopping people before they attempt to cross on to US soil. The southern border has been a political headache for the Biden administration heading into November’s election. Mr Biden has been repeatedly criticised by Republicans and their party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who said last month that the president had “surrendered our southern border.” The president hit back, accusing the Trump camp of an ""extremely cynical political move"" by pressing Republican politicians to block a proposed border plan in Congress earlier this year.",2024-08-01 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgryy0jk1zo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

Murray, the two-time Olympic singles champion, and Dan Evans lost 6-2 6-4 to American third seeds Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul. Murray, 37, confirmed before the Paris Games that it would be his final event before retiring from the sport. ""I'm proud of my career, my achievements and what I put into the sport,"" said Murray. After a long hug with Evans at the baseline, Murray was visibly emotional at the noise created by the fans at Roland Garros chanting his name in appreciation. Evans gently encouraged his team-mate to go into the centre of the court for one final time and Murray waved to all sides before disappearing to the locker room. Speaking shortly afterwards, Murray said he was ""ready"" for retirement. ""Obviously it was emotional because it's the last time I will play a competitive match,"" he said. ""But I am genuinely happy just now. I'm happy with how it finished.  ""I'm glad I got to go out here at the Olympics and finish on my terms because at times in the last few years that wasn't a certainty.""  The people v Andy Murray: Four weeks that changed him and us 'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray Sporting Giants: Andy Murray This video can not be played 'Icon' Andy Murray's tennis career over after doubles defeat A fifth Olympics is the final juncture of a tumultuous journey which led Murray to three Grand Slam titles and the top of the world rankings. After a season disrupted by injuries, including surgery to remove a back cyst just five weeks ago, it was testament to the perseverance he has always shown that he was even able to play at Paris 2024. The rollercoaster nature of his career, and his ability to wring every last drop from it, was epitomised by the epic victories which Scotland's Murray and England's Evans recorded to reach the last eight. The pair saved five match points before fighting back against Japan's Taro Daniel and Kei Nishikori on Sunday, then fought off another two against Belgian pair Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen. But another Herculean effort against opponents of Fritz and Paul's stature proved out of reach. The American duo are both established top-20 singles players at the peak of their game, are good friends who gel well as a pair and have played plenty of doubles events together. Needing to make another quick start to build momentum, Murray and Evans lacked the energy and sharpness they showed in Tuesday's second-round win. They were under regular pressure on their serve and unable to make a serious impact on return as their younger opponents stormed into a 4-0 lead in the first set and went on to win the opener 6-2. Fritz and Paul then took command with a double break in the second set before Murray and Evans showed resistance - of course - to claw one break back. Paul had spoken about the importance of taking a match point as soon as one arrived and, although the Americans failed to do that when they served at 5-2, they took their chance at the second time of asking. This video can not be played 'I've been ready for this moment' - Murray reacts after final match of career Having started playing professionally as a teenager in 2005, Murray went on to win three Grand Slam titles - including the 2012 Wimbledon triumph which ended Britain's 77-year wait for a home men's singles champion. In 2016, Murray was the first British player to become the men's world number one, reaching the pinnacle of the sport after a stellar season which ended up being the best of his career. But his career was stalled by a hip injury which began to hamper him in 2017. After attempts to play through the pain, it led to a resurfacing surgery - where a metal cap is inserted into the joint - in 2019 which he thought would end his playing days. Amazingly, Murray resumed his singles career. He even won another ATP title in Antwerp later in 2019 and went on to record more memorable Grand Slam matches. However, he was never the same player and unable to forge another deep run at a major. More setbacks continued this year, leading him to the conclusion that it was finally time to call it day. A celebration of his career followed at Wimbledon last month and, although he has long recognised there is no ""perfect end"" to a tennis career, he had hoped another Olympics medal alongside Evans would be as fitting as it could be. ""I gave a lot to it physically which I'm paying a little bit for now,"" Murray said.

Boulter and Watson lost 6-3 6-1 to the third seeds in a tough match where they had few opportunities. The Britons have gelled together superbly this week, beating some notable opponents to reach the last eight. But Errani and Paolini, who were French Open runners-up on the same Roland Garros clay little over seven weeks ago, proved a different proposition. Asked what makes the Italians so good, Watson, 32, said: ""They don't miss. They make barely any unforced errors but they play such aggressive tennis at the same time. ""It's really difficult to play them. They are a really great team."" Boulter, playing on her 28th birthday, said the enjoyment the British pair have had throughout the week remained on show even in defeat.

969,Why the world's anti-doping agency feels stuck between US and China,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) says it is ""unfairly caught"" in a row between the US and China, with their geopolitical tensions spilling onto the Olympic stage.  China's top swimmers have been in the spotlight after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that Wada was covering it up.  Chinese swimmers headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance.  Wada said in its statement on Tuesday that it had been caught in ""the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that"".  ""Certain individuals [in the US] are attempting to score political points purely on the basis that the athletes in question are Chinese,"" Wada head of media relations James Fitzgerald told the BBC. ""The result is that it has created distrust and division within the anti-doping system."" A trade war, geopolitical rivalries and Beijing's friendship with Russia have soured relations between the world's two largest economies.  It's little surprise that some of those tensions play out in competitive sports but now they appear to be driving a harder - and harsher - wedge. Last week, Wada had said it was considering legal action against its US counterpart, Usada, over ""defamatory"" accusations.  The latter had accused Wada and China's anti-doping agency, Chinada, of being among the ""dirty hands in burying positive tests and suppressing the voices of courageous whistleblowers"".  US lawmakers, too, have accused Wada of failing to investigate doping allegations against Chinese swimmers properly. And on Tuesday they introduced a bill that would give the White House power to cut funding to the agency.  ""When members of congress and senators are inserting themselves into the largely technical world of anti-doping, it ceases to be about scientific and legal analysis, and it drifts into the political realm,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. Wada's statement on Tuesday followed reports in the New York Times about a previously undisclosed case involving two Chinese swimmers - including one on this year’s Olympic team - who were investigated for doping.  They had tested positive for a banned steroid in 2022, but they were cleared to compete. China's anti-doping agency concluded that the athletes had most likely consumed the steroid unknowingly while eating contaminated burgers. Usada accused Wada of letting China ""compete under a different set of rules, tilting the field in their favour"".  But Wada defended the decision. It said the athletes’ nutritional supplements and hair tests had returned negative results, and that both swimmers also provided control samples that were negative in the days before and after the one test that was positive. It added that the two swimmers were suspended for more than a year and then their cases were closed.  Their cases are part of a ""wider series of cases involving [Chinese] athletes from different sports"",  the agency said, adding that, ""based on the number of cases, clearly there is an issue of contamination in several countries around the world"". In a statement in June, Wada noted that athletes who eat meat sometimes test positive for drugs if they have ingested clenbuterol, a banned substance which is used as a growth promoter for farm animals.  That statement, in response to questions from the New York Times, said the agency  was investigating instances of contamination in China as well as Mexico, Guatemala and other countries.  The agency's boss Olivier Niggli pointed out at the time that US media had ""only asked questions about China when meat contamination is an issue in many countries"", and referred to ""attempts to politicise anti-doping"". All of this follows a bigger controversy in April, when the New York Times reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.  But they were cleared to compete after Chinese officials found the results were caused by contamination. The 30-member team went on to win six medals, inlcuding three golds in Tokyo. Eleven of those who tested positive were also picked to be part of the Chinese swimming team for the Paris Olympics. US swimmer and 11-time Olympic medalist Katie Ledecky had said her confidence in anti-doping regulators was at an ""all-time low"" after the news about the 23 Chinese swimmers. Wada's investigation, however, found that it was ""not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination"" was the source of the drug, heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ).  It said the contamination theory was supported by ""the combination of the consistently low concentrations of TMZ as well as no doping pattern"" among the tested athletes. That is, their test results over several days were not consistent, veering between negative and positive.   An independent investigation found that Wada did not mishandle the case or show bias towards the Chinese swimmers.   The scandals upped the pressure on anti-doping officals and by the time the Chinese swimming team arrived in Paris, they were being tested far more than is standard.   Since January,  each of the team's 31 members have been tested, on average, 21 times by various anti-doping organisations, according to World Aquatics, which oversees water sports. In comparison, Australia's 41 swimmers have been tested an average of four times and the 46 US swimmers, an average of six times. The flurry of tests has sparked another set of allegations. The state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times blames Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"".  Speaking to the Global Times, an international politics professor in Shanghai, accused the US of dominating anti-doping rules. Shen Yi suggested that the ""relentless and unethical testing"" had disrupted the Chinese team's training, which she called a ""disgrace to the Olympics"".  Chinese swimmer Qin Haiyang, who holds the world record for the 200m men's breastroke, said this testing ""proves that European and American teams feel threatened by the performances of the Chinese team in recent years"".  ""Some tricks aim to disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defence. But we are not afraid,"" he said on Chinese social media platform Weibo. Qin, who won golds in the 50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships last year, finished in seventh place in the men's 100m breaststroke final on Sunday.  This criticism was echoed by former Chinese diving champion Gao Min who said the rigorous testing had ""disrupted our Chinese swimming team"" and called Qin's performance ""the worst in any competition over the past two years”.   China's current medal tally stands at one gold, two silver and two bronze.  China's “butterfly queen”, Zhang Yufei, who won a silver in the 100m event in Tokyo, was in tears over her bronze finish on Monday but said the doping tests did not have a big impact on her. While they were a ""bit annoying"", she said it was the pressure that was ""far greater"" than she had imagined.

967,Ledecky becomes USA's most decorated female Olympian,"Katie Ledecky (right) has won a gold, silver and bronze in Paris so far Katie Ledecky became the United States' most decorated female Olympian and France's Leon Marchand reached yet another final on a boisterous night of swimming in Paris. The USA - with Ledecky swimming the third leg - claimed silver in the women's 4x200m relay in seven minutes 40.86 seconds at La Defense Arena. It takes Ledecky's Olympic tally to 13 medals - eight golds, four silvers and one bronze. The 27-year-old retained her 1500m freestyle title with impressive ease on Wednesday. She also took 400m freestyle bronze and on Saturday will bid to secure yet another gold in the 800m freestyle. Australia set an Olympic record to take gold in 7:38.08, with China third with 7:42.34. Great Britain's women finished fifth, with the quartet of Freya Colbert, Abbie Wood, Freya Anderson and Lucy Hope clocking 7:48.23.

965,How a refugee Olympian found a new life in Canada,"Nigara Shaheen’s journey to becoming an Olympic judoka did not begin with judo. Instead, it began with a 30-minute karate lesson on her family’s balcony in Peshawar, Pakistan.  She was 11 years old and had already been a refugee for most of her young life, having fled her native Afghanistan in 1993 with her parents as an infant, her mother carrying her as they walked two days and nights through the mountains to safety.  She has faced many more obstacles to fight in the sport she loves, in between her first-ever karate lesson and competing in the Paris Olympics as part of the Refugee Olympic Team. Since 2022, the 31-year-old athlete has been living and training in Toronto. As a young student in Pakistan, Ms Shaheen faced harassment by older men on her way to the refugee school she attended, and bullying by her peers.  In an essay in the Toronto Life magazine, she recalled: ""One day, an older man assaulted me and my sister. He screamed at us and pushed me to the ground. I wanted to punch and beat him, but I didn’t know how.""  Her mother said she needed to learn how to defend herself.  The school she attended didn't offer martial arts or other after-school activities for students - even if it had, it would often close, sometimes for weeks at a time, she told the BBC in an interview from Paris.  But through her extended family, she heard about an instructor who was coaching karate at a nearby school. He couldn't train her there, but he could come to her.  Soon after, Ms Shaheen was on the balcony at her aunt's home, getting coached. Her mother told her the balcony was all the family had to offer “but you can use it as much as you want”, she recalled. Not long after, Ms Shaheen was fighting in local karate tournaments. Her coach, noticing her talent and passion, suggested she try competing in judo.  “I asked him ‘what’s judo? And how would I know what to do?’ He told me: ‘Just grab your opponent and throw her, that’s it,’” she said. Ms Shaheen was able to take down her first opponent in a few seconds. She had a knack for the sport. While winning felt good, it was the philosophy of judo that got her hooked. “(My first coach) said you will not learn how to get up unless you fall. As a kid, that really motivated me,” she said.  It also reminded her of watching the WWE with her father, a wrestling fan, as a child. The sport gave her the confidence to find herself - and joy in her life - despite the hardships she faced as a refugee. Ms Shaheen’s coaches began to notice her talent. At one point she trained with Pakistan’s national judo team but could not compete alongside them without a Pakistani passport. In 2014, Ms Shaheen returned to Afghanistan, where she studied political science and public administration at the American University in Kabul. She also trained with the Afghani national team, were she was welcomed by her male colleagues.  ""Inside the gym, we were a family, and they treated me like I was their sister,"" she wrote in Toronto Life.  She continued to train and compete, and began to receive a lot of attention as a female athlete in Afghanistan - some of it unwanted. “I faced immense cyber bullying,” she told the BBC. The harassment later turned physical. “There were so many times when cars would chase us,” she said. Once, someone threw a soft drink can in her mother’s direction as she was dropping her off at practice. She left her home country again, in 2018.  “I always say that I became a refugee for a second time,” she said. She moved to Russia for her master’s studies in international trade and entrepreneurship. But unlike the welcome she received at her gym in Afghanistan, she couldn't find a training partner in Russia. She spent the next year training alone - a time she has called ""the worst days"" of her career.  In 2019, she was approached by an International Judo Federation member, who suggested she try out for the Refugee Olympic Team.  She qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a serious shoulder injury knocked her out of the competition.  By then she had finished her studies in Russia and the situation in Afghanistan had deteriorated drastically.  “I was just stuck,” Ms Shaheen said.  She returned to Pakistan where she mostly stayed at home in fear of her safety - she had faced criticism for not wearing a headscarf during the Games - and contemplated her next steps.  That’s when the opportunity to live and train in Canada opened up, with the help of the Olympic Refugee Foundation and United Nations Refugee Agency. Ms Shaheen was accepted to study in Toronto for a postgraduate degree in international development.  She arrived in September 2022 - a bittersweet moment for the athlete who had already journeyed through three countries in search of stability. It was in that Canadian city where her judo career was given a new lease on life.  “I was so happy to finally be at a place where I can be myself,” she said. “But it was also hard for me because I had to say goodbye to my parents for the second time.” In Paris, she is one of the 37 athletes playing for the Refugee Olympic Team - a team Ms Shaheen is grateful to be a part of. “I feel really proud,” she said ahead of her first competition on Tuesday against Mexico’s Prisca Awiti Alcaraz. “I’m as much of an Afghan as I am a refugee,” she said. The banner for the refugee team is “a flag that I can relate to”. While she lost to Ms Alcaraz, Ms Shaheen has said that she is thankful to be able to compete at the highest level.  ""Even with every loss, I learn something new.""  She will appear on the mat once again on Saturday, where she will represent the Refugee Olympic Team in the mixed team event - her first time doing so. ""Team events are more exciting since I always look at my teammates and feel like I can’t let them down so I fight for all of them,"" she told the International Judo Federation ahead of the competition.  After the games, Ms Shaheen plans to call Canada home - she is now a permanent resident - and she hopes to one day work to assist refugees like herself. Her parents are still in Pakistan, where they are cheering her on as she lives out her Olympic dream.  At her lowest points, she said she would lean on her family for support.  “My sister used to tell me, ‘I trust that one day you will achieve something big, and this will be a memory and you will laugh about this.’” “Now is the time that I laugh about it.”",2024-08-01 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4vr7kyq5o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
963,Biles wins all-around title for sixth Olympic gold,"This video can not be played 'Incredible on so many levels!' - Biles seals all-around gold with floor routine Simone Biles won the all-around gymnastics title for her second Olympic gold in Paris and sixth overall to cement her place back at the top of her sport with yet another sparkling slice of history. The American, who won the title at Rio 2016 and had been favourite at Tokyo 2020 before she pulled out, became the oldest winner of her sport's blue-riband event for 72 years in front of another celebrity-studded crowd. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade claimed silver at the Bercy Arena, with defending champion Sunisa Lee taking bronze. The world's most decorated gymnast, Biles put on a sparkly goat necklace while celebrating - as if there was any doubt about her status as the GOAT (greatest of all time). ""It's a little ode... a lot of people love it. They always call me the GOAT, so I thought it would be really special if I got one made,"" she said. ""The haters hate it, but I like that even more. It's just a special part of me that I have here. ""In the [athletes'] village I have a stuffed goat. Just to get a reminder, like 'You can go out there, you can do it. You've done it before. So let's go'."" At the age of 27, Biles is the first gymnast to win non-consecutive all-around Olympic titles - a demonstration of her longevity in a gruelling sport traditionally dominated by teenagers.  The past 12 Olympic all-around women's champions were teenagers, and even the last non-teen, Ludmilla Tourischeva, had turned 20 only a few weeks before she won in 1972. Biles' intention was clear from the outset of Thursday's session. Starting with her 'Biles II' vault - the hardest in women's gymnastics - proved a good decision as she needed that extra buffer of points when she made an uncharacteristic mistake on the uneven bars. ""Thank God we did the double pike today [on vault] as I wasn't planning on it,"" she said. She was behind Andrade after two rotations but pulled off a difficulty-packed beam routine, fighting off gravity to stay on the 10cm-wide apparatus, to score 14.566 and bring the crowd to their feet as she went back to the top of the standings. Taking a lead of 0.166 into the final rotation on floor, Biles was last to perform and delivered a flawless demonstration of some of her best skills to post a total of 59.131. That meant she finished a comfortable 1.199 ahead of Andrade, who could only applaud and enjoy what her rival had done, as did everyone else in the packed arena. Great Britain's Alice Kinsella came 12th after a marked improvement on her qualifying performance, and compatriot Georgia-Mae Fenton was 18th. Simone Biles has now won six Olympic golds, one silver and two bronze Biles helped the United States reclaim the team title two days ago, but Thursday evening was about her trying to once again take the prize of world's best gymnast after the turbulence of Tokyo. The pressure of expectation she faced going into the Games three years ago, her struggles without her family there because of the pandemic restrictions and her withdrawal from several finals when she suffered the disorientating mental block that gymnasts call the 'twisties' are all well-documented. Biles, who returned to the sport after a two-year break last summer, told reporters she had weekly therapy sessions for the past three years and at other times during these Games.  ""It means the world to me,"" she said of her victory. ""I'm super proud of my performance and the fight that I've had for the last three years - mentally and physically - just to get back."" But she did not have the easiest ride to gold, saying: ""I've never been so stressed before - thank you Rebeca."" She went as far as to say she never wanted to compete against the Brazilian again, although that will be hard in Paris as they have both qualified for the vault, beam and floor finals. ""I've never had an athlete that close - it definitely put me on my toes and brought out the best athlete in myself,"" she said of Andrade, who was also the silver medallist in Tokyo.  A huge gasp sounded round the arena - where Kendall Jenner and basketball star Stephen Curry were among those attending - when she made a mistake when making a transition to the lower bar, needing to bend both knees to avoid touching the ground, and missed a connection to score 13.733 on uneven bars. But that is traditionally the 'weakest' of her four pieces - and after some quick reassurance from her husband that she could still win she made up ground and stretched ahead with 14.566 on beam and 15.066 on floor.   This video can not be played Watch: Best of 'superstar' Biles' all-around final routines Biles has said she does not keep count of her statistics; instead saying it is all about going out there and doing what she loves. It could be said, of course, that with so many records, it actually is genuinely hard to keep track. Although she did correct someone at the news conference who said she had nine Olympic golds rather than nine medals. This final alone was historic; it was the first time two female Olympic all-around champions had gone head-to-head for a second title, with Biles facing team-mate Lee - the Tokyo 2020 gold medallist. Biles was already the most decorated gymnast coming into the Paris Games.  Her tally of world and Olympic medals stood at 37 - and she has now taken that to 39, with chances to add to it in the floor, beam and vault finals in the coming days. With the team gold on Tuesday that took her to eight Olympic medals, she overtook Shannon Miller as the most decorated American Olympic gymnast - and she has now made that nine. Biles also holds the record for most women's all-around world titles (six) and most World Championships medals (30). She had the chance to set another record on Thursday - had she performed a new skill on bars that she had submitted to the International Gymnastics Federation she would have been the only active gymnast to have skills named after her on all four apparatus.  But she did not attempt it - and did not need to since her arsenal of other unique and high-value skills were more than enough to seal the gold.  She is in the vault final on Saturday (15:20 BST), then the beam (11:38 BST) and floor (13:23 BST) finals on Monday.

983,'Is she black or Indian?': Trump questions Harris' racial identity,"Donald Trump has questioned Kamala Harris' racial identity during a heated exchange at a convention for black journalists.  Trump falsely claimed the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee had only emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black,"" he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday.  ""So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris said Trump's remarks were ""the same old show"" of ""divisiveness... and disrespect"".  ""The American people deserve better,"" she told a meeting of the historically black sorority Sigma Gamma Rho in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us - they are an essential source of our strength."" Ms Harris is the first black and Asian-American vice-president, with Indian and Jamaican-born parents. She attended Howard University, a historically black university, and joined the predominantly black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She became a member of Congressional Black Caucus after entering the Senate in 2017.  Trump's claims prompted a heated exchange with ABC News' correspondent Rachel Scott, one of the moderators of the Chicago event.  ""I respect either one,"" the Republican said in reference to Harris' racial identity. ""But she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a black person.""  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no-one ""has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no-one's right.""   ""Since when is Donald Trump, with his long and ugly history of racism, the arbiter of Blackness?"" congressman Ritchie Torres of New York posted on X. He described Trump as a “relic of a racist past"".  The Republican nominee and former president has a history of attacking his opponents on the basis of race. He falsely accused Barack Obama, the country's first black president, of not being born in the US. Trump attacked the former UN ambassador and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley by falsely claiming she could not be president because her parents were not US citizens when she was born. Ms Harris has faced a series of attacks since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have criticised the decision, saying she was chosen only because of her race. Tim Burchett, a Republican congressman from Tennessee, called her a ""DEI vice-president"" - a reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programmes.  On Wednesday, Scott pushed Trump to clarify whether he believed Ms Harris was a ""DEI hire"". He replied: ""I really don't know, could be."" Ms Harris has described growing up engaged with her Indian heritage and often visited the country. Her mother also immersed her two daughters in the black culture of Oakland, California - where she was raised, she said. Trump also attacked Ms Harris' credentials during the discussion, saying she had failed her bar exam early in her legal career. His comments were met with murmurs from the crowd.  ""I'm just giving you the facts. She didn't pass her bar exam and she didn't think she would pass it and she didn't think she was going to ever pass it and I don't know what happened. Maybe she passed it,"" he said.  Ms Harris graduated from the University of California Hastings College of Law in 1989. The New York Times reported that she failed her first attempt and passed at the second. The state bar of California says fewer than half of those who sit the test pass on the first attempt.  The Chicago discussion began with a contentious back and forth between Scott and the former president. Trump accused the journalist of giving a ""very rude introduction"" when she began the conversation asking about his past criticism of black people.  She cited Trump calling black journalists' questions ''stupid and racist'' and that he had ''dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar a Lago resort''. ""I love the black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the black population of this country,” he responded.  The former president criticised the conversation hours later on his social media platform. ""The questions were rude and nasty, often in the form of a statement, but we CRUSHED IT!"" he said.

Losing there for the first time since 2021 was tough to take for the long-time world number one. She was the overwhelming favourite to add Olympic gold to her five Grand Slam titles. Swiatek was visibly upset when she tried to speak to broadcast journalists about an hour after the match and decided not to speak to their written counterparts - as she is entitled to do under Olympic rules.

It is a question I am frequently asked. Driven, passionate, emotional, resilient and potty-mouthed are all adjectives regular Murray watchers could turn to. Mischievous, funny, loyal, polite and indecisive are words I would add, having been lucky enough to develop a professional relationship with him over the past 11 years. As I travelled home from Wimbledon one autumn afternoon, a message flashed up on the screen in my car. It was from Murray's long-time agent Matt Gentry, informing me Andy had just contacted him to say I had cut him up on a slip road on to the A3. I am still (well, 95%) sure I had not - and was only too aware of his sense of humour - but my pulse still quickened a little when I turned off the A3 and was followed for the next 20 minutes by an expensive-looking car. I never got a clear look at the driver's face as he was a lot lower to the ground than I was, but the journey home became more relaxing once the car in question had turned left. I got off much more lightly than Britain's Davis Cup winner Dom Inglot, who was dropped in it from a great height by Murray when he suggested, in a live television interview, that Inglot had met a new woman while in Glasgow on national duty. A frantic call home reassured his then partner that Andy was just being Andy. This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray As an interviewee, Murray has almost always been polite, patient and generous with his time - and very good value. I can count on one hand the number of times he turned me down for an interview, and one of those occasions was after the 2016 Australian Open final against Novak Djokovic. He went straight from the Rod Laver Arena to the airport to catch the last flight of the night, as wife Kim was at home, heavily pregnant with their first child. Murray is often shivering when I interview him - a recent plunge in the ice bath tends to do that to you. But it shows character to do a (non-mandatory) radio interview after a Grand Slam final or semi-final defeat, of which Murray suffered a few. As with all marquee names, there was sometimes tension in the air as the post-match media round approached - especially, I remember, at Melbourne Park following one of his frequent semi-final victories. Commitments would be honoured in the early hours of the morning, but everyone was very conscious of the clock ticking down to the Sunday final. Murray is invariably good copy, as we like to say. He has been steadfast in his criticism of those who break doping rules and in his support for equal pay and female coaches - once describing the level of sexism in sport as ""unreal"". His strong opinions are, though, expressed diplomatically. And on occasions, when time allowed and microphones were off, he was happy to expand on his thoughts in confidence. There were differences of opinion - and the odd falling-out - with the British tennis media. Following his late withdrawal and subsequent hasty exit from the 2018 Brisbane International, Murray was unhappy about some of what was written in the absence of any formal explanation. A slightly surreal off-the-record, clear-the-air session followed on speaker phone a week or so later - but only after he had briefed us from his Melbourne hospital bed about the hip operation he had undergone earlier that day. This video can not be played Watch the best bits from Andy Murray's emotional interview on Centre Court Murray truly loves tennis and cares about the progress of other British players. He was the guy who would watch streams of Challenger matches on his laptop, and I vividly remember him sitting in a draughty stand late one night at the 2016 Australian Open to watch Dan Evans in qualifying. At that same tournament, at 1am on the morning of the singles final against Djokovic, Murray appeared in the Rod Laver Arena players' box to take photos and videos of his brother Jamie, who had just won his first Grand Slam men's doubles title. It is amazing to think he made it this far, given his right hip handed in its notice seven years ago. He was still world number one then, and even though his thirties have been dogged by injury, just think of the extra memories he is leaving us with. Winning the 2019 European Open in Antwerp with a metal hip; playing mixed doubles with Serena Williams at Wimbledon; an epic singles match against Thanasi Kokkinakis that lasted until 4:05am at the Australian Open. All after having survived what he billed as probable retirement in Melbourne in 2019. ""I wouldn't be so sure,"" was coach Ivan Lendl’s take after that emotional news conference. He knew his man very well. Lendl showed no emotion when rising stress levels got the better of Murray on the court. The way he verbally abused his team during matches was, frankly, appalling. He was not proud of it and tried, unsuccessfully, to change his ways. Andy Murray thought his career was about to end going into the 2019 Australian Open but a hip resurfacing operation allowed him to play for another five years Watch Andy Murray: Will to Win Listen: Sporting Giants - Andy Murray When I began this job, Murray was already an Olympic, US Open and Wimbledon champion - but the story was only half-told. My favourite memories are of the man who won all 11 matches he played as Britain won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years. There was the pivotal Sunday singles against France's Gilles Simon in the quarter-finals at Queen's. Murray found himself a set, a break and break point down, sinking to his knees in exhaustion after losing one 35-stroke rally. He was in floods of tears by the end as he helped Britain into the semi-finals for the first time in 34 years. Having given very serious thought to pulling out of the lucrative ATP Finals to prioritise clay-court practice for the final, he secured the cup for his country with a victory over David Goffin, courtesy of that now famous top-spin lob. He was in Belgrade the following July to support, rather than play, for his country in a tie with Serbia. This was just a week after he had won Wimbledon, in what turned out to be arguably the greatest year of his career. A second Olympic gold followed in Rio a month later and he would win his last 24 matches of the season to become world number one for the first time. Heady days which all too quickly turned sour - but he was at least able to make a last Wimbledon appearance this year, albeit in doubles rather than singles, and appear for his final tournament at the Paris Olympics alongside Dan Evans. What a body of work, and what a mark Murray has made on British life, as well as British sport.

992,I want to apologise to Khelif - Italian boxer Carini,"This video can not be played Italian boxer Carini pulls out after 46 seconds of fight Italian boxer Angela Carini, who abandoned her Olympic bout against Algeria's Imane Khelif inside 46 seconds, says she ""wants to apologise"" to her opponent for how she handled the moments after the fight. Khelif is one of two athletes who have been cleared to compete in the women's boxing in Paris, despite having been disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships for failing to meet eligibility criteria. The 25-year-old's participation in the Games has proved controversial, leading the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to defend her right to compete. ""All this controversy makes me sad,"" Carini told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport. ""I'm sorry for my opponent, too. If the IOC said she can fight, I respect that decision."" Carini, also 25, said abandoning the fight had been a mature step to take, but she expressed regret at not shaking hands with Khelif afterwards. ""It wasn't something I intended to do,"" Carini said. ""Actually, I want to apologise to her and everyone else. I was angry because my Olympics had gone up in smoke."" She added that if she met Khelif again, she would ""embrace her"". Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't Khelif being in women's boxing not fair, says next opponent Khelif opponent abandons early in controversial fight After taking a punch to the face inside 30 seconds during Thursday's fight, Carini went to the corner for her coach to fix her headgear. After briefly resuming, she returned to her corner once more and stopped the fight. Carini later told BBC Sport: ""It could have been the match of a lifetime, but I had to preserve my life as well in that moment."" The Russia-led International Boxing Association (IBA), which carried out the tests last year, said Khelif ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". Khelif has always competed in the women's division and is recognised by the IOC as a female athlete. ""The Algerian boxer was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport,"" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said on Friday. Later on Friday, the IBA president Umar Kremlev said his organisation would offer Carini $100,000 (£78,000) - which is the prize money it is offering gold medallists at the Games. That money would be split with half going to the boxer, a quarter to her trainer and a quarter to her federation.

991,Lin wins controversial first bout at Paris Olympics,"This video can not be played Lin reaches 57kg quarter-finals Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, whose inclusion at the Paris Olympics has sparked controversy after she was reported to have failed a gender test last year, won her first bout of the Games in the women's division. Lin - like Algerian Imane Khelif, who progressed on Thursday - was banned by the International Boxing Association (IBA) but has been allowed to compete at the Olympics, which are run by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The 28-year-old entered the arena to cheers, which were followed by some boos, before beating Sitora Turdibekova in the 57kg category. The pair shook hands briefly after the bout but did not after the result was confirmed. Turdibekova left the arena in tears and did not stop to speak to the media. She and her team quickly left the venue.  Lin stopped briefly, but did not answer a question.  The controversy has engulfed the Olympics after Italy's Angela Carini withdrew from her bout with Khelif on Thursday, saying: ""I had to preserve my life."" Whereas Khelif's bout lasted just 46 seconds, this went the full three rounds - with Lin victorious by unanimous decision. Only one of the five judges awarded a round to Uzbekistan's Turdibekova. Lin, who now has a career record of 41 wins and 14 defeats, is a three-time World Championship medallist and two-time Asian champion. Turdibekova, aged 22, was competing at her first Olympics. Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't Khelif being in women's boxing not fair, says next opponent I want to apologise to Khelif - Italian boxer Carini The IBA has said Lin and Khelif were banned ""to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition"". Lin was stripped of a bronze medal at last year's World Championships. Last June, the IBA - a Russian-led body - was stripped of its status as the sport's world governing body by the IOC.  The IOC, which defines gender by how it is recorded on an athlete's passport, said the pair were ""suddenly disqualified without any due process"". ""The question you have to ask yourself is 'are these athletes women?',"" spokesperson Mark Adams said prior to Friday's fight. ""The answer is 'yes'. According to their eligibility, their passports, their history. A test which may have happened - a made-up test which was new - should not be given credence."" The IBA, however, defines gender differently. It defines a woman, female or girl as ""an individual with chromosome XX"" and men, males or boys as ""an individual with chromosome XY"".

990,"Whisper it, but is now a good time to holiday in Paris?","For all those concerns about high prices and big crowds ahead of the Olympics, now might just be an unexpectedly good time to holiday in Paris. Hotels and restaurants have told the BBC they have dropped their prices to entice customers - after what some call a “catastrophic” downturn in takings during the Games that have left them asking what the event has done for them. The French capital might seem to be the centre of the world for those watching the sport on TV – but the city’s relatively quiet streets and empty dining tables tell a different story. Earlier this week, local media ran reports of a “deserted” Disneyland and of Parisians’ bemusement as they managed to secure seats on metro trains at rush hour.  So, what is happening? Analysts suggest that many Parisians have left the city in droves for the summer, as is their tradition. But also, some overseas visitors have been put off by concerns around price-gouging and overcrowding on an Olympic scale. One of the locals who used the word “catastrophic” was a restaurateur called Lies in the usually bustling Latin Quarter, who said July had been his worst month for 25 years. During the height of Covid, at least people continued to order meal deliveries, he told the BBC. Tourists had been put off coming to the area because of security blockades that were put in the place for the previous week’s opening ceremony, Lies suggested. Another nearby restaurateur hovering in his doorway, Yarva, said would-be visitors had chosen not to pay hotel prices which multiplied several times ahead of the Games. The event was “only for the rich”, he said, and used a hand gesture to indicate he thought the price inflation had been crazy. Ahead of the Games, airlines warned there was a low appetite for journeys to Paris, with both Delta and the company that owns Air France predicting an impact on their business.  “Unless you’re going to the Olympics, people aren’t going to Paris,” the Delta boss told CNBC. This was reflected in flight prices that were well below the usual asking price for this time of year, according to travel expert Simon Calder, writing this week for The Independent. Next-day one-way flights from UK cities were as low as £31 (€36; $39) per adult (from Edinburgh) at the time of writing this article. However, tickets for the Eurostar trains, which were last week affected by a sabotage attack on the French railway network, were considerably higher. June and July saw an “avoidance effect”, said Raphael Batko of hotel marketing firm Doyield, which represents about one in 20 of the city’s hotels. He also used the word “catastrophic” to describe the phenomenon, though he said visitor numbers had picked up and were now satisfactory. A similar avoidance phenomenon has been noticed in previous Olympics, including in London in 2012, when businesses suggested that the Games had deterred visitors and shrunk their profits. What remains to be seen is whether the emergency action taken by the hospitality industry will be enough to salvage the Olympic trade for many Parisian businesses. With restaurants dropping their prices, it was now possible to get a meal for as little as €8 (£6.80, $8.70) in the Latin Quarter, claimed Riad, the proprietor of the Olympie diner, as he tried to entice diners. Hotels, too have tried a similar trick – largely reversing the earlier rises which appear to have been so off-putting. Tourism authorities confirmed that average prices had returned to €258 (£219; $279) per night during the Games, following a massive hike that had previously seen them peak at €342 last month. The BBC saw that a number of Airbnbs on offer were advertising price reductions, although the company said prices had remained stable since the start of the year, and more locals had been opening their homes in host cities. Individual hoteliers in Paris spoke of mixed success.  One reception manager, Dino, said bookings had reached normal levels - but only after rates were slashed by half when things “looked bleak”. Another, Isabelle, said her own price drop had been ineffective and lamented that “we didn’t gain anything from the Olympics”. As well as the sport, there were plenty of good reasons to come to the French capital for the summer, said Christophe Decloux, head of the Choose Paris regional tourist board. He cited the city’s rich cultural offering, plus smooth transportation and a “very joyful” atmosphere during the Games. “Paris is usually very calm in late July and August because people leave for the holidays,” he said, “and right now it is just as calm as usual in August except in some areas around the venues where people are bonding over the sport.” Organisers of Paris 2024 have trumpeted the positive effects of the Games on Paris following record ticket sales. It remains possible to sign up to see events, as tickets are released each day. About 800,000 of them are still up for grabs, organisers told the BBC on Friday. The sporting spectacle itself has already proven memorable - and with some disgruntled businesses doing everything they can to coax in visitors, last-minute bookers to Paris might find themselves in with a chance of scoring a bargain.",2024-08-02 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7970gz3qro,Unknown,Unknown,,True
994,Kamala Harris formally chosen as Democratic nominee,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has passed the threshold to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in a vote of party delegates. Speaking by telephone, Ms Harris said she was ""honoured to be the presumptive nominee"" as the virtual roll call continues ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago later this month. Ms Harris is the first black woman and first South Asian woman to become the White House standard-bearer for a major US political party. If she defeats Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in November she would be America's first female president. She ran unopposed in the virtual roll call after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month and quickly endorsed her. Several potential rivals followed his lead. On Friday afternoon, Ms Harris formally became the nominee after securing the support of 2,350 delegates, the threshold required to earn the nomination. ""We believe in the promise of America and that’s what this campaign is about,"" she said in brief remarks by phone as she crossed the benchmark. ""We are in this, we are on the road and it's not going to be easy, but we’re going to get this done."" In total, Democrats have said 3,923 delegates - or 99% of the participants - plan to vote for her. The rollcall began on Thursday and ends on Monday. Presidential and vice-presidential nominees are typically anointed at their party conventions, but the relatively late date of the 2024 DNC risks falling afoul of state ballot access laws. Ms Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California, and is the first Democratic nominee in the party's nearly 200-year history to hail from a western state. She rose through the ranks of state politics from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then US senator. Before dropping out of the race, Mr Biden had easily won the Democratic primary. He did not face stiff opposition despite voter concerns about his age and had won backing from 99% of pledged DNC delegates. But the 81-year-old faced escalating pressure from within the party to withdraw after a poor June debate performance against Trump. The decision to hold a virtual nominating process ahead of the 19-22 August convention was made while Mr Biden was still the presumptive candidate. It came in response to rules for ballot access in the state of Ohio, which requires that candidates for the November ballot be formally selected 90 days before the election - or by 7 August. Republican leaders in the state had warned they would enforce the law and, though lawmakers eventually created an exemption as they have done in the past, Democrats said an early rollcall would pre-empt further risks of their candidates being excluded from the ballot. Delegates do not need to vote on the vice-presidential pick. Ms Harris is expected to name her running mate by Monday. The Trump campaign and some Republicans have criticised the replacement of Mr Biden with Ms Harris, arguing she is the first major party candidate to secure the nomination without holding a press conference or a sit-down interview. Some have referred to the substitution as a ""coup"". But Ms Harris has hit the campaign trail hard since Mr Biden's endorsement, making the case against Trump in multiple campaign rallies and fundraisers across battleground states. On Friday, the campaign announced it had raised more than $310m (£242m) in the month of July, with more than two-thirds of people donating money for the first time. That figure is more than double the $138m raised by the Trump campaign last month and marks the biggest haul of the 2024 election cycle so far.",2024-08-02 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng1my55vno,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1009,Rittenhouse u-turns after saying he won't vote Trump,"Conservative campaigner Kyle Rittenhouse has promised to support Donald Trump in November's US election, reversing comments hours earlier that he would vote against him because he was ""bad"" at protecting gun rights. Mr Rittenhouse, now 21, shot dead two men during racial unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. He was cleared of all charges the following year after arguing self-defence.  Instead of Trump, he said he planned to write in former Libertarian presidential nominee Ron Paul on the ballot.  Trump has repeatedly vowed to protect Americans' right to own guns and to roll back Biden-era restrictions on firearms.  Mr Rittenhouse - who became a cause célèbre among some US conservatives during his trial - met Trump just a week after being cleared of charges in November 2021, with the president calling him a ""fan"".  In an online post early on Friday, Mr Rittenhouse - now outreach director for the group Texas Gun Rights - said that ""unfortunately, Donald Trump has bad advisers, making him bad on the Second Amendment"", which protects gun ownership in the US.  ""If you cannot be completely un-compromisable on the Second Amendment, I will not vote for you,"" he said on X, formerly Twitter. ""We need champions for the Second Amendment or our rights would be eaten away and eroded each day."" ""I support my decision and I have no take-backs,"" he added.  In a later post, however, he wrote that in the last 12 hours he had had ""a series of productive conversations with members of the Trump's team and I am confident he will be the strong ally gun owners need to defend our Second Amendment rights"". He called his comments from the night earlier ""ill-informed and unproductive"". Soon after his original post, Mr Rittenhouse shared another post from the leader of the National Association for Gun Rights outlining the group's criticism of Trump's record. It cites his support while president for raising the minimum age for gun purchases and openness to expanded background checks. Trump quickly backed away from those ideas at the time. The list also included Trump's  2018 ban on bump stocks, an accessory that allows semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of bullets per minute, similar to a machine gun. The Supreme Court overturned the prohibition two months ago. Mr Rittenhouse's video drew the ire of some Trump supporters, some of whom responded with expletive-laden tirades.  ""The left hates you and now Maga will shun you,"" one user wrote.  But the former president's political opponents celebrated what some termed a ""break-up"" between Mr Rittenhouse and Trump.  ""When you've lost Kyle Rittenhouse... Trump campaign is in trouble,"" posted the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group.  Trump, now the Republican nominee for president, has repeatedly vowed to protect gun rights if elected in November's election.  In February, he told a meeting of the National Rifle Association that “every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated on my very first week back in office"".  In 2021, the most recent year for available data, almost 49,000 people in the US died of firearms-related injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The figure includes both murders and suicides. ",2024-08-02 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrlrzw5550o,Unknown,Unknown,,True

Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta got France's winner when he headed home Michael Olise's fifth-minute corner at the near post. Argentina's best chance came just before half-time with Giuliano Simeone heading over from close range.

French fans booed the Argentinian national anthem before the match at Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, and the fracas at the final whistle highlighted the rivalry and tension. France, who last won Olympic gold in men's football in 1984, will face Egypt in Monday's semi-final (20:00 BST) after the Pharaohs beat Paraguay 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 draw.

1017,"Khelif being in women's boxing not fair, says next opponent","Khelif is scheduled to fight Hungary's Hamori on Saturday Hungarian boxer Anna Luca Hamori says she doesn't ""think it's fair"" that her next opponent, Imane Khelif, is taking part in the women's category at the Olympics. Hamori, 23, will face the 25-year-old Algerian in the quarter-finals of the 66kg competition on Saturday. Khelif is one of two athletes - along with Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting - who have been cleared to compete having been disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships after they were said to have failed gender eligibility tests. The Hungarian Boxing Association has protested against Khelif's participation at Paris 2024, and the Hungarian Olympic Committee requested talks with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the issue. Kheireddine Barbari, the head of the Algerian delegation at the Paris Olympics, said the Algerian Olympic Committee had filed a complaint with the IOC over the ""immoral"" campaign against Khelif. Hamori wrote on social media: ""In my humble opinion, I don't think it's fair that this contestant can compete in the women's category. ""But I cannot concern myself with that now. I cannot change it, it's life. ""I can promise you one thing... I will do my best to win and I will fight as long as I can!"" Hamori has beaten Ireland's Grainne Walsh and Australian Marissa Williamson to reach the quarter-finals. She has previously fought at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games and was a silver medallist in the 66kg class at the 2022 European Under-22 Championships.  Lin's next opponent also criticised the fact that she has to face a boxer whose participation at the Olympics has been questioned.  In the quarter-finals, Lin faces Svetlana Kamenova Staneva of Bulgaria on Sunday morning.  ""With the situation in this category, which, you know, people are talking about all over Facebook, the internet and media, this is not good for women's boxing,"" Staneva said.  A Bulgarian Boxing Federation spokesperson added: ""We believe that athletes should be placed on an equal level in any competition, especially when it comes to the Olympic Games. ""In the case of Imane Khalif and Lin Yu-ting, we see no such equal treatment and strongly oppose their participation."" Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't I want to apologise to Khelif - Italian boxer Carini Lin wins controversial first bout at Paris Olympics Both Lin and Khelif made it through to the Olympic quarter-finals in comfortable fashion. Khelif beat Angela Carini in the first round of competition as the Italian abandoned their bout after 46 seconds. Carini said on Thursday she ended the fight to ""preserve her life"", but apologised to her opponent on Friday, saying ""if the IOC said she can fight, I respect that decision"". Lin, 28, dominated Uzbekistan's Sitora Turdibekova in the 57kg category on Friday.  The Russia-led International Boxing Association (IBA), which carried out the eligibility tests last year, said Khelif and Lin ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". Lin and Khelif were banned, the IBA has said, ""to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition"". Lin was stripped of a bronze medal at last year's World Championships. Last June, the IBA was stripped of its status as the sport's world governing body by the IOC.

Djokovic, holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles, beat Italian Lorenzo Musetti 6-4 6-2 on Friday to reach the Olympic final for the first time.  The 37-year-old Serb, who lost in straight sets to Alcaraz at the All England Club last month, has won every major singles title except the Olympics. He was fourth in Tokyo three years ago and took bronze at Beijing in 2008 - his only previous Olympic medal. Djokovic's routine win was in stark contrast to his match on the same court against Musetti at the French Open two months ago, which went to five sets and finished at 03:07 local time. He now faces Spanish second seed Alcaraz, who thrashed Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-1 6-1 in Friday's other semi-final. The 21-year-old will contest his third major final two months, having won the French Open at the same venue in Paris in June, before his Wimbledon win. This video can not be played Highlights as 'maestro' Alcaraz reaches Olympic singles final Elsewhere, world number one Iga Swiatek won bronze in the women's tournament. The Pole was left in tears on Thursday after her 25-match winning streak on the Paris clay was ended by China's Zheng Qinwen. That defeat meant Swiatek missed out on the gold-medal match. However, she was back in action on Friday, breezing past Slovakia's Anna Karolina Schmiedlova 6-2 6-1 in just 61 minutes to add Olympic bronze to her five Grand Slam titles. It is Poland's first Olympic medal in tennis. Czech pair Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac won the mixed doubles gold, beating China's Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen 6-2 5-7 10-8. Canadians Felix Auger-Aliassime and Gabriela Dabrowski beat Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof of the Netherlands to take the bronze.

1019,Hodgkinson makes winning start to Olympic title bid,"This video can not be played Watch: GB's Reekie, Gill & Hodgkinson reach 800m semi-finals Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson made a winning start to her Olympic 800m title bid as Joshua Cheptegei claimed the first track gold at Paris 2024 in the 10,000m. Hodgkinson, 22, is targeting a first global crown after finishing second at successive World Championships since she clinched a stunning silver on her Olympic debut as a teenager in Tokyo. She controlled her heat from the front to come home in one minute 59.31 seconds and qualify for Sunday's semi-finals, where she will be joined by team-mates Jemma Reekie and 17-year-old Phoebe Gill. World record holder Cheptegei, of Uganda, sprinted clear on the final lap to set an Olympic record of 26:43.14 and clinch the first gold on the eye-catching purple track inside the Stade de France. The 27-year-old, a three-time world champion over 10,000m, finished ahead of Ethiopia's Berihu Aregawi and bronze medallist Grant Fisher, of the United States. Elsewhere, Great Britain will compete for a mixed 4x400m relay medal on Saturday after the quartet of Samuel Reardon, Laviai Nielsen, Alex Haydock-Wilson and Nicole Yeargin set a national record to win their heat in 3:10.61. The United States qualified fastest for that final in a new world record of 3:07.41. Team GB's Scott Lincoln was unable to qualify for the shot put final with a best throw of 19.69m. The French athletes were backed passionately throughout the evening and, in a remarkable moment, the men's decathlon 400m was delayed by loud chants of 'Allez les Bleus' when swimming superstar Leon Marchand won his fourth gold of the Games. Josh Kerr and rival Jakob Ingebrigtsen remain on course for their anticipated Olympic gold-medal showdown after both qualified from their men's 1500m heats in Friday's morning session. This video can not be played Watch: Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei wins men's 10,000m gold GB's Kerr and gold-medal rival Ingebrigtsen progress Athletics stars, rivalries & key events at Paris 2024 By a combination of her own sustained development and determination, and the misfortune suffered by one of her biggest rivals, Paris represents Hodgkinson's best chance yet of landing global gold after a series of near-misses. The Briton has run one second quicker than any other woman this year after smashing her own national record with 1:54.61 at the London Diamond League a fortnight ago, having defended her European title in June despite battling illness. With Athing Mu unable to defend her Olympic title after falling at the US trials, one of the 'big three' of women's 800m running has been removed from the equation, leaving Kenya's reigning world champion Mary Moraa as Hodgkinson's greatest threat. Moraa qualified second in her heat, with her time of 1:57.95 the second-fastest overall behind Tsige Duguma of Ethiopia (1:57.90). ""[The heats are] worse than the final. In the final you know you're just giving it everything,"" Hodgkinson said. ""You've got to contend with people giving it their absolute all. You want to conserve energy but at the same time you don't want to make any mistakes. Definitely glad that's done, the semi-finals will be more fun."" Mu's absence has also opened the door for the other two Britons, with Reekie, 26, hoping to go one better than her agonising fourth in Tokyo and Gill looking to ride the wave of a sensational breakout season. Reekie won the opening heat in 2:00.00, while Gill - Britain's youngest Olympic track athlete in 40 years - finished third in her race in 1:58.83. Gill said: ""It's the Olympics, it's the best competition in athletics, and seeing my face on the screen I was trying my best not to cry.""

American world champion Sha'Carri Richardson and Jamaica's two-time Olympic 100m gold medallist Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce will also be in semi-final action, with the final taking place at 20:20. Before then, Great Britain will contest the mixed 4x400m relay final at 19:55. The men's 100m competition gets under way during Saturday's morning session, with Team GB's world bronze medallist Zharnel Hughes, rising star Louie Hinchliffe and Jeremiah Azu contesting round one from 10:55. That will also see the start of American Noah Lyles' bid for a potential four golds in Paris.

1020,GB win team jumping gold for first time since 2012,"This video can not be played Brash secures team jumping gold for Team GB Great Britain won Olympic team jumping gold for the first time since London 2012 with a near-faultless performance in Paris. The British trio of Ben Maher, Harry Charles and Scott Brash picked up just two  time penalties to top the standings at the stunning Chateau de Versailles, with the United States second and France in third. Their medal comes 12 years after Maher, Brash and Charles' father Peter won team jumping gold at the London Olympics alongside Nick Skelton - 60 years after Great Britain's previous gold in the event in Helsinki in 1952. Charles had just turned 13 when his father stood atop the Olympic podium but now joins him in the history books. He, Maher and Brash secured Team GB's ninth gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Brash takes moment to make memories by winning second Olympic gold The first of those nine also came in equestrian - in the team eventing. Maher, on Dallas Vegas Batilly, was first up for Britain, and the Tokyo 2020 individual gold medallist picked up just a solitary time penalty to lead the standings after the opening round. Charles, now 25 and at his second Games, backed that up with a clear round on Romeo 88. Great Britain's final combination - Brash on Jefferson - were the last to jump. Cool and collected, they brushed a couple of fences but went clear with just one time penalty to their names. ""I knew when Scott went in we had the best man to do it,"" Maher, 41, told BBC Sport.  ""But we didn't leave him the margin. If he'd had a fence down that could have been expensive. Honestly they were two of the best riding rounds I have seen in a very long time. ""All of our horses didn't knock a jump down all day so I am very proud of the team."" Brash, 38, added: ""There is pressure on all of us when it's only a three-man team. Every score counts. ""I was fortunate to be in that position. The guys rode unbelievably to get me into that position and I wanted to deliver for them."" Peter Charles with his Olympic gold medal in 2012, and Harry Charles with his in 2024 Charles made his Olympic debut at the postponed Tokyo 2020 Games - nine years after his father's success in London - in what was his major championships debut.  In Paris, he was riding with a strapped arm after breaking it in July. The sport runs in the Charles family, with Harry's sisters Scarlett and Sienna also showjumpers. Asked if his father's gold medal had put more pressure on his shoulders, he said: ""It's no extra pressure. Our family has a lot to thank Ben and Scott for. ""They were on the podium with my dad in London and now I get to share a podium with them. ""I've looked up to them since I was a kid. Now to win a gold medal alongside them is beyond my dreams.""  Brash joked: ""Me and Ben feel like the old veterans now. ""Harry's only 25 but he's very experienced already. He rode in Tokyo, had a little warm-up there, and then delivered today."" Peter Charles, who is working behind the scenes with the GB team in Paris, told BBC Sport: ""The dream is to win an Olympic gold medal but to do it so young, at his age, with two guys I rode with in London, that's surreal. ""I haven't had a moment to reflect on it."" On his son's round, he added: ""Brilliant. Nick Skelton came up to me and said: 'At that age, I couldn't have done that.' He said: 'That was absolutely brilliant.' Harry's got many more opportunities if, please God, everything goes right. ""It's a wonderful moment to enjoy, to showcase the sport, how beautiful it is.""

1032,"In one US state, women politicians dominate. What pointers can it offer Kamala Harris?","In a country where women still find it challenging to reach high office, the swing state of Michigan is an outlier. Its three most senior elected officials are all women - nationally women fill only around a quarter of senior political roles. With no woman having ever served as president, the state run by women could offer pointers for a route to the White House for Democrat Kamala Harris. Opinion polling does not offer a clear answer on whether people are less willing to vote for a woman, but they certainly end up electing fewer overall. And you don’t have to look far to find the perception that women still have to fight harder to get elected. Robyn Kepplinger may be one of the few in her pro-gun, anti-abortion rural western Michigan town who is thrilled at the chance to vote for a Democratic woman for president. The 33-year-old says she could not imagine a better candidate to lead the country ""in the direction that we need to go"". Listen to Madeline read this article Ms Kepplinger, a resident of Jenison, has thrown her support behind Vice-President Harris. On Friday, the 59-year-old secured enough delegate votes to become Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race on 21 July. But even some Harris fans worry that being a woman could be a significant obstacle between her and the presidency. “For anyone to be doing something that has not been done before, it's difficult,” Ms Kepplinger said. “I don't think that most people are behind a change as drastic as a female leader.” Such a change, however, has proven possible in the key battleground state of Michigan, where three female Democrats now hold the top positions: Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Attorney General Dana Nessel. In fact, Michigan has had two female Democratic governors in the past 20 years, Jennifer Granholm and Ms Whitmer. Only around a quarter of senators and state governors in the US are women. The figure for representatives is slightly higher at 29%. “Women are still underestimated,” said Marcie Paul, the chair of Fems for Dems, an advocacy group for liberal women in Michigan. “It’s going to be no different for her [Ms Harris], I believe, than it was when they said three women on the top of the ticket cannot possibly win in Michigan.” Ms Harris, however, shares some of the traits that made women in Michigan successful candidates, according to Kim Gates, Democratic chair of Kent County, Michigan. Ms Harris, Ms Whitmer and Ms Granholm managed to strike a balance between compassion and strength as “straight-talking, strong women”, Ms Gates said. “They have great speaking skills. They’re able to sound like they’re talking to the average person,” she said. “They’re compassionate.” Combining straight-talking, strength and compassion is easier said than done, but if Ms Harris can, it may bode well for her. Female candidates may also prove more adept than men at galvanising voters around the issue of reproductive rights after the fall of Roe v Wade. Voters nationwide cite abortion rights among the most important election issues, with one recent poll from KFF finding 1 in 8 voters saw it as a top priority for November. The issue has been relevant at the polls, with anti-abortion advocates losing a series of contests in Republican states since the federal right to abortion was overturned in 2022. In the past two years, a handful of states have passed ballot measures protecting the right to abortion, including in the Republican strongholds of Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio. The cause helped propel Ms Whitmer to victory in her race for re-election in Michigan in 2022, the same year Michigan residents voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. During Ms Harris’ tenure, she has shown a strong focus on reproductive rights, recently visiting a clinic that provides abortions. It’s an area where her gender could prove an advantage, said Adrian Hemond, a political strategist in Michigan. “Vice-President Harris is a much better messenger on that issue than Joe Biden,” he said. As concerns grew around 81-year-old Mr Biden’s ability to beat Trump in November, some major donors paused funds when the president’s poll numbers were falling in swing states, including Michigan. Meanwhile, Trump, 78, also saw a boost in personal ratings after a gunman attempted to assassinate him at a rally in Pennsylvania last month. But after Mr Biden stepped down, Ms Harris received a record level of donations - $81m (£63m) within 24 hours. Since then, a Morning Consult poll released on Tuesday showed Harris’s approval rating at 50%, up from 43% a week previously, and a separate poll from Reuters/Ipsos found Ms Harris was supported by 43% of registered voters, and Trump supported by 42%. Some Democratic campaigners in Michigan say that her background as a black woman has helped Ms Harris reach some voters. Her Indian heritage - and the fact she is significantly younger than both Mr Biden and Trump - are also said to boost her appeal to some of the electorate. Greg Bowens, a member of the executive board of the NAACP in Grosse Pointe, said there is “excitement in the air” in Detroit. He added this hasn’t been seen in Detroit - Michigan's largest majority African-American city - since Barack Obama, the first black president. “She has electrified black and brown folks,” he said. While an apparent wave of enthusiasm grows among some Democratic voters, Ms Harris has been subjected to attacks based on her gender and background. A 2021 video of Trump’s running mate JD Vance resurfaced has resurfaced, with the Republican criticising the political left - including Ms Harris - for being full of “childless cat ladies with miserable lives”. The remark was criticised widely, including by actor Jennifer Aniston, but they were seized on by some conservative figures on social media, who argued that Ms Harris is less suitable to be president because she lacks a stake in the future. Ms Harris is step-mother to her husband’s two children. More generally, female candidates face more superficial criticisms than male politicians about how they look, how they carry themselves and how they speak, said Ms Paul, the Fems for Dems leader who helps encourage women to vote and run for office. It’s a point seemingly not lost on many voters - a Pew Research Center poll from September 2023 said 62% of Americans believed there was too much of a focus on female candidates’ appearances, versus 35% for male candidates. Female politicians of colour are targeted more than their white male counterparts, said Nazita Lajevardi, a Michigan State University political science professor. “Women of colour politicians face attacks that are gendered and raced at the same time,” she said. “They report experiencing more verbal attacks, more online abuse."" Female, black public figures can be subjected to scrutiny of their past sexual history, said Jamil Scott, an assistant professor of government at Georgetown University. Images have circulated on social media with criticisms of Ms Harris’ past romantic partners. Whatever the motivation for circulating these images, Ms Harris has been married to Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff for 10 years. Ms Scott said that as a female politician, Ms Harris will also likely be forced to walk a tightrope where she is perceived as strong in attacking her Republican rival, but doesn’t risk being seen as angry. “We want women to be tough as candidates, but then we don't want them to be too tough,” she said. Ms Scott pointed to Hillary Clinton - the first US major party female presidential candidate - who was perceived by some to be unlikeable and too aggressive in her attacks against Trump in 2016. Trump attempted to exploit this sense, famously calling Ms Clinton a “nasty woman”. While Ms Harris's background and stance on abortion may appeal to some, they do not guarantee support among left-leaning voters. Tressa Johnson, a 31-year-old liberal voter from Grand Rapids, believes Ms Harris’s policy stances are what make her undesirable - not her ethnicity or gender. She says the vice-president’s past as a tough-on-crime prosecutor and the Biden administration’s limited criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza make her a poor candidate. “People just want to go, ‘Look, she's a woman of colour,’” said Ms Johnson, who plans to vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. “I just want a competent person that cares about the working class people in this country.” What Ms Whitmer’s Michigan victory can’t help the Harris campaign with is how to beat a candidate as high profile as Trump. Mr Hemond, the political strategist, said that while Ms Whitmer defeated two “ill-equipped” Republican opponents, Ms Harris is up against a tougher candidate. “It is very fair to say that Donald Trump is a much more potent electoral force,” he said. The former president and his supporters have already started to attack Ms Harris based on her gender and ethnicity. Echoing comments from Trump’s 2016 race, in which the former president accused Ms Clinton of playing the “woman card” to attract voters, Trump’s allies have claimed Ms Harris was picked solely for the purpose of “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion” (DEI). It’s the kind of attack that Ms Harris would do best to ignore, as Ms Whitmer has done, said Mr Hemond. During Ms Whitmer’s run for governor and time in office, she has been subjected to a host of sexist remarks, including from Michigan’s former Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who once said he had “spanked” Ms Whitmer “hard” while working with her on the state’s budget. “Gov. Whitmer largely let others litigate the sexist comments that were made about her, which was smart,” Mr Hemond said. “There does seem to be a perceptual danger for female candidates in engaging directly with these types of comments.” Mr Hemond added that ignoring these types of comments often makes for an effective strategy because a majority of voters are women themselves, many of whom can relate to having to handle “sexist comments gracefully”. Some liberal residents in Michigan hope voters will see beyond the DEI attacks against Ms Harris. “She is intelligent, she has deep experience governing and making policy,” said Brandy, a voter in Southeast Michigan. The Morning Consult poll also showed that Ms Harris’ ratings are a significant improvement on Mr Biden’s in swing states, and that she has gained 5 points in Michigan. But Trump has strong support here too. A week after the shooting, he spoke to a crowd of 12,000 in Grand Rapids in his first public rally since the attack. It’s a state Trump won by 11,000 votes in 2016 when he beat Hillary Clinton. Mr Biden won it back in 2020 by over 100,000 votes. In some respects, the political backdrop has changed since 2016, Ms Scott said. Voters were “not excited about Hillary Clinton”, she said. “They didn't see the power in the moment of having a woman run for president.’’ But another wave of women may have been inspired by Ms Clinton’s defeat, and Trump’s victory, Ms Scott said. After millions of women participated in marches across the US to protest Trump’s inauguration, the country saw a record number of female candidates running for office in 2018. Meanwhile, the percentage of Americans who believe men better suited to politics than women fell from 19% in 2014 to 14% in 2018, according to data from the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center. In 1975, 47% of Americans believed men made better politicians than women. Ms Harris has already seen an outpouring of support, in particular among black women and on social media, where memes of the vice-president are ubiquitous. She is framing the race in November as a choice between “freedom” and “chaos” under Trump who she points out has been convicted of 34 felonies. But ultimately, it may be her diverse background and experience that pulls more voters into the race, experts said. “So many people see themselves in her, especially in a state like Michigan, where many people are of immigrant backgrounds or are black or South Asian,” said Ms Lajevardi, the Michigan State professor. “It matters when someone knows your community’s interests and seeks to represent them.” Technically, Ms Harris became the first female president in 2021 - when she was handed presidential powers for 85 minutes while Mr Biden underwent a health check. Now the challenge for her campaign is to see whether she can extend that to four years. Michigan offers pointers as to how women can take the top jobs, and stay in them.

1025,Snoop Dogg: America's cheerleader at the Olympics,"There are few people who have become more synonymous with the 2024 Olympics than Snoop Dogg.  When there is an American athlete vying for a medal in Paris, there is a camera ready to pan to the American rapper cheering in the stands. He has been seen dancing alongside the US women's gymnastics team, dressing up in equestrian gear to support American horseback riders and even trying out judo skills. Snoop Dogg's enthusiasm for the games has injected a new energy into the Olympics that is captivating viewers in Paris and the internet alike, and making for a highly watched summer games, according to NBC viewership numbers. After multiple clips went viral from Snoop Dogg's time hosting a highlight show with comedian Kevin Hart on NBC's streaming platform Peacock during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 - the network gave the rapper an even bigger role in 2024: special correspondent.  But Snoop Dogg has seemingly taken the role to the next level becoming a cheerleader for American athletes regardless of the sport.  He started his games with an integral role: he was among the final torchbearers of the Olympic flame before the game's opening ceremony last week.  The 52-year-old, whose full name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, carried the torch through the streets of Saint-Denis in the north of Paris, home to the Stade de France Olympic Stadium. And while the role of special correspondent and his torch-bearing job were announced ahead of time, Snoop Dogg's consistent presence and high energy for the American athletes has been a special surprise for viewers.  “We’ve been pleasantly surprised by his popularity, but you never ever underestimate Snoop Dogg,” Molly Solomon, NBC’s executive producer of the Olympics, told reporters this week.  She described him an “ambassador of happiness”. When the US women's gymnastics team competed earlier this week, Snoop Dogg was dancing in the stands and sporting a t-shirt with Simone Biles' face on it. Elsewhere in Paris, he has cheered on tennis star Coco Gauff and volleyball star Kelly Cheng, among countless others.  On Saturday, he joined American celebrity chef Martha Stewart in watching the equestrian events, while decked out in horse riding gear.  He participated in promotional judo event during the games where he was awarded an honorary black belt and got a swimming lesson from American-swimming great Michael Phelps.  Some have suggested the rapper's presence has been a defining factor in better ratings. Beginning on 26 July, the day of the opening ceremony, the five-day total audience average was 34 million viewers when combining daytime and primetime coverage, an NBC Sports release said. That is up 79% from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics where viewership suffered because of the pandemic.  But beyond the ratings and the internet coalescing, Snoop Dogg said he is just enjoying himself. Never ""in his wildest dreams"" did he expect to play this role in the Olympics, he told NBC Nightly News’ Lester Holt in an interview recalling watching the Olympics on TV when he was younger.   ""I'm the biggest kid in the crowd,"" Snoop Dogg said. ",2024-08-03 23:10:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p229ldn4vo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1035,Biles wins vault for her third gold of Olympics,"This video can not be played Biles wins vault gold American gymnast Simone Biles won her third Olympic gold of the Paris Games when she took the vault title in emphatic fashion. After helping the USA to women's team gold and then taking the all-around title, the 27-year-old reclaimed another of the titles she first won at Rio 2016, having lost them in Tokyo when she pulled out of several events. She nailed her huge Biles II vault before sticking her 'easier' vault - whose difficulty is harder than many attempt as their best vault - to score an average of 15.300. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the only gymnast who has skills that can come close to Biles and who won the title in Tokyo, took silver with 14.966 and American Jade Carey got bronze with 14.466. Biles had said after winning the all-around title two days ago that facing Andrade was ""stressful"" as she was the only gymnast who has ever pushed her closely and joked she did not want to face her again. There had been anticipation that Andrade might try a new skill that she has submitted - a triple-twisting Yurchenko vault that would have a difficulty value closer to Biles' best vault - but that did not materialise. The 25-year-old, who beat Biles on this apparatus at last year's World Championships, performed her vaults well. She scored higher than Biles for execution on both vaults, but with difficulty values that were a full mark lower than her rival's efforts, Andrade would only have had a chance if the American had faltered. Biles became the third most decorated female gymnast with 10 Olympic medals and with two more finals to come on Monday - floor and beam - she can overtake second-placed Vera Caslavska, who won 11 for Czechoslovakia between 1960 and 1968.

1036,Eligibility-row boxer Khelif secures Paris medal,"This video can not be played Imane Khelif beats Luca Anna Hamori by unanimous decision Boxer Imane Khelif, whose gender eligibility has been called into question, was in tears after guaranteeing a welterweight medal at the Paris Olympics by beating Hungarian Luca Anna Hamori. The Algerian is one of two boxers competing in Paris despite being banned from last year's World Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) after she was reported to have failed gender eligibility tests, a situation which has sparked huge controversy. The 25-year-old's previous bout lasted just 46 seconds but Khelif, having entered the ring to cheers from loud Algerian support, went the full three rounds on Saturday, winning by unanimous decision. ""I feel good,"" an emotional Khelif told BBC sports editor Dan Roan. ""It's the first medal in women's boxing in Algeria - I'm very happy. I want to thank all the world and the Arabic world - thank you so much."" Hamori said prior to the fight she did not ""think it is fair"" Khelif was competing, but the bout was largely fought in good spirits. The pair shared an embrace after the bell and again after the result was confirmed. ""It was a very hard day for both of us but I just want to say it was a great fight and I wish good luck to Khelif in the future, and thank you so much,"" Hamori said. Asked again if she thought the fight was unfair, Hamori, who was booed into the arena, said: ""I don't care about it."" Shortly after the fight, Algeria president Abdelmadjid Tebboune posted on social media: ""You have honoured Algeria, Algerian women and Algerian boxing. We will stand by your side, whatever your results are. Good luck in the next two rounds and moving forward."" Khelif will meet Janjaem Suwannapheng, who beat favourite Busenaz Surmeneli - the 2021 Olympic champion from Turkey - in the semi-final on Tuesday. Even if she loses Khelif will leave the Paris Games with a bronze medal. Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't Bach defends Khelif and Lin competing in Olympics Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting have been strongly backed amid tense debate by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who run the boxing competitions at the Games. IOC president Thomas Bach said earlier on Saturday there was ""never any doubt"" the pair are women. Khelif reached the final of last year's World Championships before being disqualified by the IBA - a Russia-led organisation suspended by the IOC in 2019 because of concerns over its finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging. The IBA said Khelif had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out"" in its regulations, while the IOC said the pair had been ""suddenly disqualified without any due process"". On Saturday, the IBA said it would hold a news conference on Monday ""dedicated to the detailed explanation of the reasons for the disqualification"" of Khelif and Lin.  The Hungarian Boxing Association protested against Khelif's participation at Paris 2024 before the fight Yacine Arab, the Algeria National Olympic Committee's sport manager, said the controversy around Khelif has been a ""joke"". Some reports have taken the IBA statement that Khelif and Lin have XY chromosomes to speculate they might have differences of sexual development (DSD) like runner Caster Semenya. Arab denied this. Speaking to the BBC's Roan before Saturday's fight he said: ""When she arrived at the village she did this test. ""Do you think if she was positive they would let her fight? Never. She did all the tests - even the tests for pregnancy. All the tests were negative. ""[The IBA] said she was positive and her testosterone is very, very high. Then the medical president of the IOC said that it's really normal in boxing that the athletes' testosterone is high. For all the girls it is the same. Imane is not alone in this case. ""The controversy is a joke. Everyone knows that Imane was born a girl. She has fought all her life as a girl. All the competitions she was a girl. When she was losing nobody talked about this.""

The 10th British gold of Paris 2024 was won in the men's rowing eights on Saturday, and put GB fifth in the medal table. The women's eights won a hard-earned bronze, as the rowing team reached historic heights in the French capital. GB's equestrian team continued their impressive Games with a bronze in the team dressage, but missed the chance to complete an unprecedented equestrian clean sweep following golds in team eventing and jumping. In the gymnastics, American superstar Simone Biles won her third gold of the Games in the vault, while Team Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan became the new Olympic pommel horse champion. GB's Max Whitlock missed out on a history-making medal in the same final, but there was success for Jake Jarman, who claimed bronze on floor. Meanwhile, there were mixed fortunes on the track, as Louie Hinchliffe won his men's 100m heat - but team-mate Jeremiah Azu was disqualified. St Lucia's Julien Alfred stormed to the women's 100m title to make history as her nation's first ever Olympic medallist, but GB's Daryll Neita finished four-hundredths of a second off the podium in fourth. There was success in the 4x400 mixed relay, with Great Britain securing bronze. There was also bronze for Emma Wilson in the windsurfing, GB's first sailing medal at Paris 2024. However, she was disappointed to miss out on gold having dominated the earlier rounds and said she was ""done with the sport"". In the pool, Adam Peaty made his return from Covid to help the team qualify for the mixed medley relay final. But he didn't feature in that final, with GB's Kathleen Dawson, James Wilby, Duncan Scott and Anna Hopkin finishing seventh.

Firstly, the women's eights took bronze after a close battle with Canada, who won silver, while Romania ran away with gold. Then came the men, who were neck-and-neck with the Netherlands at the halfway mark before charging away in the final 500m to emulate the gold they won in this event in 2016. Cox Harry Brightmore was on his feet in the boat, pointing out each of the eight rowers to congratulate them on their achievement. This was GB's eighth rowing medal in Paris, making it their best medal tally for an overseas games. They won nine in 2012 and eight in 1908 - both in London.

American superstar Biles, 27, secured her third gold of the Paris Games when she took the vault title on Saturday in emphatic fashion. It was another of the titles she first won at Rio 2016, then lost in Tokyo when she pulled out of several events with the 'twisties'. Meanwhile, in the La Defense Arena, legendary swimmer Ledecky won the women's 800m freestyle final for the fourth consecutive time. The 27-year-old is the first female swimmer, and the only swimmer other than the great Michael Phelps, to win the same Olympic event four times in a row.

Defending champion Whitlock, who was going for an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus, finished fourth and said he was now ""done"" competing. There was, however, success for Team GB at the Bercy arena, with Olympic debutant Jake Jarman claiming bronze in the floor final.

In doing so, the 23-year-old made history by winning St Lucia's first ever medal at the Olympic Games in a national record time of 10.72 seconds. Afterwards, she revealed she watched ""all Usain Bolt's races this morning"", taking inspiration from the record-breaking Jamaican running legend. American world champion Sha'Carri Richardson took silver in 10.87, with compatriot Melissa Jefferson (10.92) third. Great Britain's Daryll Neita finished four-hundredths of a second off the podium in fourth, crossing the line in 10.96. Neita produced the highest-placed finish by a British female athlete in an Olympic sprint final for 64 years, but said afterwards she was ""finding it hard to find words"" after coming ""so close"" to a first individual global medal.

But before that, the men's 100m - arguably the highlight of the Olympics in male competition - could not have got off to a worse start for Team GB. It was heartbreak for Azu as he was disqualified from his heat for a false start. The 23-year-old from Cardiff - who ran 9.97 seconds in May, one of the top 10 times ever by a British athlete - fiercely fought his case, but eventually left the track in the most disappointing fashion.

Ledecky clocked eight minutes 11.04 seconds to become the only woman - and only swimmer other than the great Michael Phelps - with four Olympic golds in the same event. It was Ledecky's ninth Olympic gold, moving her level with former Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina, and taking her overall tally to 14 medals.  Phelps has the most medals of any Olympian with 28, including 23 golds. ""The four-times record is the one that means the most to me,"" Ledecky, 27, said afterwards. ""3 August is the day I won in 2012, and I didn't want 3 August to be a day I didn't like moving forwards.  ""I put a lot of pressure on myself, so I'm happy I got the job done."" Earlier on Saturday, Summer McIntosh's astonishing debut Games continued, with the Canadian 17-year-old securing her third gold with victory in the women's 200m individual medley. But Great Britain's 4x100m medley relay defence ended in disappointment, with the quartet finishing seventh. Katie Ledecky (left) has lost just once in 13 years in the 800m freestyle Ledecky has won four medals in Paris alone - two golds, a silver and a bronze. She became the United States' most decorated female Olympian with silver in the women's 4x200m relay on Thursday. Such is her dominance in the 800m freestyle that she has lost just once over the distance in 13 years - and that was to rising star McIntosh at a regional meet earlier in 2024. McIntosh opted not to swim the 800m in Paris, meaning Ledecky's biggest rival was old foe Ariarne Titmus. Australia's Titmus beat Ledecky to 400m freestyle gold earlier in the week but she could not stay with the American in the closing stages of her favourite distance. The two shared a warm moment at the end of the race, with Ledecky raising both their arms in the air before Titmus applauded her opponent as she left the arena. ""We have just seen a little bit of history there,"" Steve Parry, Olympic bronze medallist for Britain in 2004, said on BBC 5 Live. ""Ledecky is the absolute queen of the pool. To be able to see someone dominate a distance event for 13 years is absolutely brilliant."" Titmus took silver in 8:12.29, with Ledecky's American team-mate Paige Madden (8:13.00) completing the podium. ——————————————————— London 2012 (1)  Gold - 800m freestyle Rio 2016 (5) Gold - 200m freestyle, 400m freestyle, 800m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle relay Silver - 4x100m freestyle relay Tokyo 2020 (4) Gold - 800m freestyle, 1500m freestyle Silver - 400m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle relay Paris 2024 (4) Gold - 800m freestyle, 1500m freestyle Silver - 4x200m freestyle relay Bronze - 400m freestyle ——————————————————— Summer McIntosh is making her first appearance at an Olympic Games Canada's McIntosh is becoming one of the stories of the Games, with the teenager tipped to break numerous records in her career. She has already started in Paris, touching home in the 200m individual medley in an Olympic record 2:05.56 to ensure a fourth medal at her debut Games. ""For sure it was painful. Winning gets rid of all the pain,"" she told the BBC. ""I was screaming at myself under water a few times because I could tell that I was behind. ""I knew that I just had to keep going and I just had to push through that wall."" She previously took gold in the 200m butterfly and 400m medley, along with silver in the 400m freestyle. Americans Kate Douglass and Alex Walsh won silver and bronze respectively, before Walsh was disqualified before she had even left the pool for an illegal turn from backstroke into breaststroke. That meant Australia's Kaylee McKeown was upgraded to bronze. McKeown later joined her team-mates for the mixed relay, with the Australians securing bronze. The United States won gold in 3:37.43 and China silver, but Britain's quartet of Kathleen Dawson, James Wilby, Duncan Scott and Anna Hopkin struggled from the off and finished well out of the medals.

Amber Anning held on to third position as the British team finished in a national record of three minutes 08.01 seconds at the Stade de France. However, she was passed on the home straight by Dutch star Bol, who produced a dramatic sprint finish to overhaul the British and then American teams for gold. The Netherlands set a European record of 3:07.43 with Bol's heroics, as the USA, who set a world record in qualifying, took silver in 3:07.74. Bol measured her effort to perfection, tracking the leaders before making her final push for gold as the crowd roared her on, a year after her late fall cost her nation the world mixed relay title in Budapest. On what she was thinking in the final 100m, Bol said: ""Just keep going, keep going. And my general anger from Budapest. ""That and my team-mates cheering me. And the atmosphere in this stadium is absolutely incredible. It's crazy. So everything together."" Olympic debutant Anning's solid final leg ensured GB - whose team also included Samuel Reardon, Laviai Nielsen and Alex Haydock-Wilson - followed up their 2023 world silver with another medal in the event.

American Ryan Crouser won a third successive Olympic title in the men's shot put with a best throw of 22.90m, as compatriot Joe Kovacs took silver ahead of Jamaican Rajindra Campbell. In the women's triple jump, Dominica's Thea LaFond clinched gold with a 15.02m leap which secured her country's first Olympic medal.

The 25-year-old was guaranteed Great Britain's first sailing medal at the Paris Olympics after dominating the opening series off the Marseille coast. But she had to settle for bronze in the final as Italy's Marta Maggetti won gold and Israel's Sharon Kantor took silver. Wilson had finished well clear at the top of the standings after winning eight of the 14 preliminary races, coming outside the top three just once, but was third in the one-off final. Windsurfing and the new Olympic sport of kitesurfing are the only sailing classes to adopt a winner-takes-all medal race.  At last year's World Championships in Lanzarote, Wilson won 15 of the 20 opening races, but finished with silver behind Kantor in the final. ""I think it's obvious I'm at a disadvantage, and I think they [sailing officials] should think about it, and think about people's mental health as well,"" Wilson said after the event. ""It's not OK to put people in this position every time. I had a 60-point lead at the World Championships and a 30-point lead here. ""I don't know how many times you can come back. I think I'm done with the sport."" It is Wilson's second Olympic medal having also won bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Games in the RS:X event, which has been replaced by IQFoil. Wilson slumped on to her board in disappointment at the finish, having been unable to reproduce her fine form from the preliminary races. That secured a bye to the final by finishing top of the standings, while Kantor and Maggetti went through to the semi-final after being second and third respectively. The duo progressed to the medal race from a semi-final which was staged over the same course less than half an hour before the final. Wilson started well, holding a narrow advantage at the first and second marks, before Maggetti charged from third place to lead around marks three and four. The Italian then held off Kantor to the finish to claim her first Olympic medal, having been fourth at Tokyo. ""I just made a mistake on the lay line,"" added Wilson, referring to the calculation required to reach the next mark, or buoy, in the quickest time. ""I hadn't done a race yet and all these girls knew where the lay line was. ""I'm really happy for her [Maggetti] but I'm just not sure I can keep putting myself through that format.""

Richardson originally only got into boxing to get fitter for football but now has an Olympic medal guaranteed, having had to drop down a weight after his preferred category was removed from the Olympic programme. Having narrowly missed out on qualifying for the Tokyo Games, he almost gave up on his Olympic dream when injuries kept him out of the ring for a year. ""I am living my dream right now,"" added Richardson. ""The last two weeks, these are my dreams. ""I belong here. ""Doubters in the past said otherwise but I have proved them wrong on the biggest stage in the world. It will be in the history books forever."" As both men fought to land the critical blow there were numerous warnings from the referee for the use of elbows and striking the back of the head, and most for Richardson’s opponent.

1049,Kamala Harris interviewing top vice-presidential contenders,"Vice-President Kamala Harris is interviewing potential contenders to be her running mate on Sunday, ahead of a battleground tour next week. Among those travelling to Washington, DC, to meet Ms Harris are Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly and Governor Tim Walz. The choices for the Democratic vice-president has been narrowed to a group of five, according to CBS, the BBC's US partner. A decision is required before the Democratic National Convention, which starts on 19 August in Chicago. It is unclear whether other potential candidates, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, were scheduled to meet with Ms Harris. Harris officially became the Democratic presidential nominee on Friday in a vote of party delegates. Once Ms Harris's running mate is announced, the two are expected to tour the battleground states. Mr Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 and could help Ms Harris capture Pennsylvania - a must-win state in the race for the White House. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot and Nasa astronaut, has become a leading voices on gun safety and his strong border stance and occasional criticisms of the Biden administration could help appeal to independent and conservative voters. Mr Walz, who served 12 years in Congress before becoming governor of Minnesota in 2019, gained national attention for his strategy calling Donald Trump and JD Vance ""weird"". On Friday President Joe Biden said he had spoken to Ms Harris about her search for a running mate. Asked what qualities she should look for in a vice-presidential candidate, he said: “I’ll let her work that out."" Potential partners to join Ms Harris on the Democratic ticket for November's election face an exhaustive vetting process, having to answer up to 200 questions before being seriously considered.  Delegates do not vote on the vice-presidential pick. The United Automobile Workers, a major US union representing more than 400,000 people, said its preferred vice-presidential pick was Mr Beshear, who “stood with us on the picket line and has been there for workers”. Speaking to CBS' Face the Nation, UAW President Shawn Fain added that Mr Walz was also “100% behind labour”, but he criticised Mr Shapiro’s support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies. While she holds those meetings, a new by CBS News, BBC's US partner, suggests Ms Harris holds a slight edge over her Republican rival Donald Trump, leading by one point nationally. Across battleground states, the poll indicates that the pair are neck-and neck. Trump still enjoys a small lead in a few states - Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina - but the race has tightened significantly since Mr Biden bowed out of the race and Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee.  The poll suggests that the vice-president has energised the Democratic base, with young, black and female voters noting their renewed enthusiasm for the presidential election. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign is still beset by comments he made at a convention for US-based black journalists in which he questioned Ms Harris' racial identity. Trump said of Ms Harris: ""I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know - Is she Indian? Or is she black?"" Ms Harris' mother was born in India and her father is from Jamaica. She has always identified as both Indian American and black. Multiple Trump allies appeared on US politics shows on Sunday in an attempt to shift attention from what he said.  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime Trump backer, said he would advise the former president to focus on the Biden-Harris administration's policy decision - not the vice-president's heritage. “Every day we’re talking about her heritage and not her terrible, dangerous liberal record throughout her entire political life [is] a good day for her and a bad day for us,"" Mr Graham told Fox News Sunday. Earlier in the day, Senator Laphonza Butler, a Democrat who represents Ms Harris' home state of California, called the comments about the vice-president's race ""despicable"" and ""an insult"" during an appearance on CNN.  ""This is a woman who was born in Oakland, California, who has declared and lived proudly all of her identities her entire life, embracing the totality of who she is,” she said. “This is the only card he’s (Trump’s) got to play, and so he's playing it. He’s desperate.”",2024-08-04 23:10:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyx559kvvnyo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

There have been plenty of highlights for the country, from Shirine Boukli winning their first medal with a bronze in the judo to swimming sensation Leon Marchand taking four golds and a bronze in the pool. They currently sit third in the medal table with 12 golds, 14 silvers and 18 bronze and have seven more days of events to add to that.

In an exciting final round that saw the lead change a number of times, Fleetwood was tied with Scheffler on 19 under walking on to the 17th hole. But a bogey after missing the green and over-hitting a chip left him trailing Scheffler going down the last. The 33-year-old Englishman also misjudged an approach on the 18th as he attacked and had to settle for a par which secured the silver medal in his second Olympic games. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama took bronze on 17 under while Rory McIlroy, representing Ireland, finished in a tie for fifth on 15 under.

The 37-year-old Serb, who has won a men's record 24 majors and swept up every title there is in tennis, finally clinched Olympic gold at his fifth Games. In what was arguably his best performance of the year, he beat French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2) in front of a packed crowd at Roland Garros. Djokovic was visibly emotional, immediately bursting into tears and falling to his knees in the middle of the court after hugging the Spaniard at the end of the match. He won singles bronze in Beijing in 2008, finished fourth at London 2012, suffered an emotional early loss in Rio in 2016 and lost the bronze-medal match in Tokyo three years ago. Djokovic becomes just the fifth player to win the 'Golden Slam' in singles - all four majors and the Olympic title - after Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.

The 26-year-old finished in a tie of 55 shots out of 60 targets with Chile's Francisca Crovetto Chadid. They went to a shoot-off and were still tied after three rounds but, in a moment of contention, Rutter was called to have missed a shot which slow motion replays appeared to show she hit. She contested the call but shooting's version of a video assistant referee (VAR) or Hawkeye is not in use at the Olympics and the judges did not overturn the decision. Crovetto Chadid, 34, struck with both her next shots to make history and clinch her country's first ever shooting gold medal. Former world champion Rutter takes a medal, though, just over three months after giving birth to her first child, Tommy, on 25 April and was surprised by her husband at the end, who had brought their son to the final.

1053,‘Marchand-mania’ inspires French unity – but for how long?,"Swimming sensation Léon Marchand appears to have inspired a little of the French ideal of ""fraternité"" that may have felt in short supply in the host nation during a time of sharp recent political division. He was again cheered on by a home crowd in Sunday's 4 x 100m medley relay, in which he and his teammates won bronze after briefly leading the contest. The 22-year-old has won four golds at the Games - more than any other French competitor at a single Olympics - and has been compared with American legend Michael Phelps. More fanciful is an idea floated by political cartoonists and social media users, who joke that Marchand should be chosen as prime minister following last month's bitterly-contested snap election, in which a left-wing coalition ultimately prevailed over the far-right. The gags show that France is looking to “laud someone who seems so dedicated and sincere in his sport, and way of life”, explained Andrew Hussey, a historian of French culture, who added that many saw Marchand as representing a contrast to the country’s politicians. The athlete's heroics were proving a welcome distraction during the crisis, said Parisians lounging on the grass in one of the city’s parks, watching the sporting action on a big screen. “We don’t want to think about the problems,” said a woman named Thanh. “We don’t want to think about the division in the country.” The swimmer had helped to “smooth everything”. Louis agreed: “When Marchand was racing, it was the most important thing for the country for a while.” Politics seem to be largely on hold for the Games, after President Emmanuel Macron said negotiations over the formation of a new government would have to wait until after the Paralympics. Mr Macron is among those who have been to roar on Marchand in person. On Friday night, the arena was filled with deafening roars of “allez” (“go”) each time the golden boy’s swimming cap bobbed above water as he powered to glory in the 200m medley. But anyone seriously hoping that Marchand will stick his head above the political parapet looks likely to be disappointed. The swimmer, who trains in the US, has avoided wading into public debate. That contrasts with another national hero, football star Kylian Mbappé, who memorably used a Euro 2024 press conference to urge a vote against the far-right. The tradition of a population galvanising around a hero is as old as the Games itself, according to Philip Barker, the editor of the Journal of Olympic History. Some host nations' sporting heroes have inspired lasting change, Barker said.  He cited Cathy Freeman, an Aboriginal runner who celebrated her 400m sprint win in Syndey in 2000 with the Australian and Aboriginal flags, as prompting an spirit of inclusivity from Australians towards the indigenous population ""that hadn't really existed before"". During the 2012 Games in London, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah were lionised after bagging a quick flurry of golds in what was quickly dubbed “super Saturday”. But the UK’s “golden era” of solidarity was fairly short-lived, Barker said, pointing to the political divisions that characterised the Scottish independence and Brexit referendums in the following years. One specialist in contemporary French politics agreed that the unifying effect of Marchand and his fellow French medallists was unlikely to last for long. “We can expect an immediate return to a fractured political field and a disgruntled electorate as soon as the Games are over,” said Emile Chabal, a professor of contemporary history at the University of Edinburgh. “No amount of Marchand-mania - and we've seen this before with great French sporting stars like [Zinedine] Zidane or Mbappé - will stop that,” he said. But for the last week, Marchand’s compatriots have been glued to his exploits – so much so that even those who have paid good money for Olympic tickets have spent some of those events watching his races on their phones. That applied to one Parisian in the fan park, Audrey, who admitted she had torn her eyes away from a volleyball match to witness Marchand claim one of his golds on her screen. Although France had found a new hero, it was possible that “maybe next week there will be another Marchand”, Audrey pointed out. And at any rate, Marchand was just a part of something bigger. “It’s not just about him,” she said, citing the “amazing” opening ceremony. France should be “very proud about what we are showing to the world” with the Olympics, she said.",2024-08-04 23:10:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8800jvx0mno,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1062,North Korea performs diplomatic gymnastics in Olympic comeback,"As the Paris gymnastics arena roared on American Simone Biles for her third gold medal of the 2024 Olympics, one of those applauding was none other than An Chang-ok, a rival from North Korea. Saturday’s women’s vault final saw the North share a stage with its foes South Korea and the US. An, 21, grinned and waved for TV cameras and hugged at least one fellow finalist - rare interactions with foreigners by a young woman required to perform diplomatic gymnastics while being carefully chaperoned on her trip away from home. Pyongyang’s decision to send athletes to these Games – two of whom even posed for a selfie with rivals from the South - has raised hopes that the secretive state could be partially reopening after a particularly deep period of isolation. After all, this comes after a heated period that has seen the North sending waste-filled balloons at the South. The North’s participation in these Games signalled a “remarkable” return to the international fold, suggested Jean H Lee, a former Associated Press journalist who opened the US news agency’s first bureau in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. It did not send any athletes to the Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021, after the country shut itself off from the world even more sternly than usual due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But in Paris, it was “making the effort to rejoin the international community”, Lee said, “regardless of what’s happening with their nuclear programme, which is always the elephant in the room”. The North’s nuclear ambitions are an enduring cause of tension with the South and the US. But there was no sign of animosity between the three nations’ gymnasts on Saturday. This new generation of North Korean athletes have claimed two silvers in Paris, and occasionally surprised sport commentators who did not know what to expect from them. Winning medals was not the country's only aim, according to Prof Ramon Pacheco Pardo of King’s College London, who has written extensively on the two Koreas. The age-old North Korean art of “sports diplomacy” involved limited participation in a global forum to prove the country was normal, Prod Pacheco Pardo said. Athletes were some of the “few actors that North Korea has who won’t be viewed suspiciously” by the world, he explained. The contrasting support for An and Biles could not have been starker. In an earlier competition during the Games in Paris, Biles was memorably cheered on by a host of celebrity supporters in the stands, including Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Tom Cruise and Snoop Dogg. Thousands of punters yelled her name on Saturday, too.  An, meanwhile, received only polite appreciation from the neutrals. She had no compatriots in the room, since ordinary North Koreans are prevented from leaving their country. It is unlikely that anyone was watching at home, either, as the Games are not being televised live in North Korea, according to Radio Free Asia (RFA). And BBC Monitoring has only been able to find a handful of text reports in the tightly-controlled state media. Nonetheless, “the chattering class of Pyongyang certainly will, from one source or another” know the Olympic results as they come in, said John Everard, the UK’s ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2008. An is among 16 North Korean who athletes have come to an opulent host city that could hardly be more different to the austere Pyongyang airport in which they were filmed setting off last month. Top North Korean athletes were likely to have some awareness of the outside world, said Everard, but there was still likely to be a “shock factor”. One of the viral moments of the Games so far was a rare encounter that seemed to break the boundaries: when a bronze-winning South Korean table-tennis player took a selfie that showed his mixed-doubles partner posing alongside the silver-winning North Korean duo. Would the leadership in Pyongyang have anticipated – or relished – this brief symbol of unity between two nations who are still technically at war? Agreeing to the selfie was “a message” from the North, said Prof Pachedo Pardo, who speculated that the move would have had Pyongyang’s consent. “North Korea is indicating that it doesn’t have a problem with South Korean people - that the issue it has is with the South Korean government.” At any rate, the moment was not totally unexpected, after something similar in 2016. And two years later, North and South fielded a joint women’s ice hockey team at the Winter Games in the South. The selfie represents one of the North’s few visible interactions with the outside world during the Games, including a perfunctory press conference by the two table-tennis stars. Away from the stadiums, unverified footage has appeared to show An holding a collection of pin-badges, which are reported to be an item popularly traded by international gymnasts. After so much exposure to the Western world, the athletes will probably undergo a gruelling “debrief” after returning home to ensure they stay on-message, said Lee, who is also the co-host of the BBC World Service’s Lazarus Heist podcast. Contrary to the myth, any athlete deemed to have “failed” would probably not be punished, the analysts agreed. But they could face gruelling “self-criticism” sessions. “The big hit for not winning a medal isn’t so much the punishment, it’s that you don’t gain all the benefits that you could have gained,” said Everard. Victorious athletes may be given higher status in society and even prizes such as a new home. It remains to be seen whether this latest sporting diplomacy will translate into meaningful new talks between the two Koreas. The relative bonhomie in Paris was briefly imperilled at the outset by a furore when organisers mixed up the two nations’ names in the opening ceremony, for which they apologised. Outside the Bercy Arena after Saturday’s gymnastics, one fan from the Seoul side was not convinced the politics would change much.  But she said the sight of sportspeople sharing a stage was at least a reminder that all Koreans were united by something “human”.",2024-08-04 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgkk0rle75o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1065,Belgium out of triathlon relay as athlete falls ill,"Claire Michel competed in triathlon for Belgium in Rio 2016 and Paris 2020 Belgium have pulled out of the Olympic mixed relay triathlon at Paris 2024 after one of their athletes fell ill. Claire Michel competed in the women's triathlon on Wednesday, finishing 38th. De Standaard, one of Belgium's biggest newspapers, is reporting that the 35-year-old has contracted E coli but BBC Sport has not been able to verify this claim. The poor water quality of the Seine had been a major talking point before and during Paris 2024. It caused the men's triathlon to be delayed by a day, while the practice swim for the mixed relay was postponed on Sunday for the second day in a row. The mixed relay race will take place on Monday morning as planned, despite a request from teams to delay the competition to allow for more athlete preparation time. A joint statement from World Triathlon and Paris 2024 said: ""The latest test results confirm that Seine water-quality levels at the triathlon venue have improved in recent hours, with forward-looking analysis indicating that water quality will be within the levels acceptable by World Triathlon."" On Saturday, the Swiss team said that their athlete Adrien Briffod - who took part in the men's race - had a stomach infection and would not compete in the mixed relay. The Belgian Olympic Committee (COIB) did not reveal what illness Michel was suffering from. COIB announced that the decision not to participate was taken ""in consultation with the athletes and the entourage"". It added that it hopes ""that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions"". Prior to the start of the Olympic triathlon event, tests were being carried out daily on the water quality in the Seine, which is also due to host the Olympic marathon swimming on 8 and 9 August, and the Para-triathlon event at the Paralympics, which start on 28 August. Swimming in the river had been banned for over 100 years because of high levels of pollution and the risk of disease, but French authorities have invested heavily to make the Seine swimmable as part of the Games' legacy. Organisers said about 1.4bn euros (£1.2bn) had been spent on a regeneration project to make the Seine safe. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo recently swam in the river to highlight the clean-up efforts which have been undertaken and, earlier this month, tests showed the river was clean enough for swimming. However, heavy rain in Paris on the first Friday and Saturday of the Olympics caused the water quality to decline - although both the men's and women's individual races were able to take place on Wednesday. Team GB have selected Alex Yee - the men's gold medal winner - Georgia Taylor Brown, Sam Dickinson and women's bronze medallist Beth Potter for Monday's event, which can be pushed back to Tuesday if the water quality is not up to standard on Monday.

1064,Boxing’s gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved?,"Lin Yu-ting and Imane Khelif are each guaranteed at least bronze medals at Paris 2024 Boxing at Paris 2024 has been overshadowed by a row about the eligibility of two fighters in the women’s competition. Algeria’s Imane Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting are guaranteed at least bronze medals. But last year they were disqualified from the World Championships. The body that oversaw that 2023 event is the International Boxing Association (IBA) and it says both fighters failed gender eligibility tests. On Monday the IBA will hold a news conference to give a “detailed explanation of the reasons for the disqualification”. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has cast doubt on the reliability of the tests and suggested what is happening is a “sometimes politically motivated cultural war”. In June 2023, the IOC stripped the IBA of its status as the sport’s world governing body over concerns over how it was run. So, what is going on? The IBA, formerly known as AIBA, was formed in 1946 as a worldwide governing body for amateur boxing. The IOC recognised the IBA as the sport’s governing body until 2019. The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019. This was because of governance issues and alleged corruption. It led to the threat that boxing would be removed from the Olympics altogether from 2028. In 2018, the IBA issued life bans to ex-president CK Wu and former executive director Ho Kim after a report documented ""gross negligence and financial mismanagement of affairs and finances"".  Wu had been in charge for 11 years before being provisionally suspended in October 2017. Wu was replaced as AIBA president by Gafur Rakhimov, who was described by the US Treasury Department as ""one of Uzbekistan's leading criminals"". Then in 2020 Russian Umar Kremlev was elected president. In 2022, an independent investigation said boxing needed to take action on ethical issues to secure its Olympic future, having found a ""historical culture of bout manipulation"" - including at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. In his final report, Professor Richard McLaren detailed decades of financial mismanagement and deception, rule breaking in the ring, and inadequate training and education programmes for referees, judges and officials.  Kremlev pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the country's newly opened international boxing centre in September 2022 Kremlev is seen as having close ties to the Kremlin. Under his leadership, the IBA has had Russian state-backed energy giant Gazprom among its chief sponsors. In May 2022, Kremlev was re-elected unopposed after Dutch boxing federation president Boris van der Vorst was declared ineligible. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) later said that Van der Vorst was wrongly prevented from standing, but a proposal to stage a new election was rejected by IBA delegates. The IOC said it was ""extremely concerned"" by the result, while Van der Vorst said he feared for the sport's Olympic future. The 2023 World Championships were held in two countries. The women’s was in India in March and the men’s in Uzbekistan in April and May. A total of 19 countries, including Great Britain and the USA, boycotted the events after the IBA allowed Russian and Belarusian boxers to compete under their countries' flags, contravening IOC guidance following the invasion of Ukraine. Kremlev said those boycotting the championships were ""worse than hyenas and jackals"" because of their violation of the ""integrity of sport and culture"". At the time, GB Boxing said of its decision to boycott the championships that the flags issues had “put further distance between IBA and the Olympic movement in addition to the significant, longstanding issues over sporting integrity, governance, transparency and financial management which the IOC has asked IBA to address to protect boxing's place on the Olympic programme”. Russian athletes like boxer Azalia Amineva are prevented from competing at Paris 2024 for their country. No Russian boxers are at the Games as neutral athletes. At the 2023 World Championships, Khelif was competing in the welterweight category and Lin at featherweight. Hours before her gold-medal match against China’s Yang Liu, the IBA said Khelif had failed a gender eligibility test. Khelif had beaten Janjaem Suwannapheng from Thailand in the semi-final, Uzbekistan’s Navbakhor Khamidova in the quarter-final and Russia’s Azalia Amineva in the round prior to that. As a result of Khelif’s disqualification, 21-year-old Amineva had the only loss in her now 22-fight career removed from the record. At the same 2023 World Championships, Lin was stripped of a bronze medal by the IBA. The IBA said the fighters had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". The BBC has, as yet, been unable to determine what the eligibility tests consisted of. It is not known how tests were overseen. In an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan on Thursday, IBA chief executive Chris Roberts said male XY chromosomes were found in ""both cases"". Roberts said there were ""different strands involved in that"" and therefore the body could not commit to referring to the fighters as ""biologically male"". He said the unspecified eligibility tests had been conducted as a result of “ongoing concerns” raised by other fighters, coaches and the IBA’s medical committee. The IOC has raised doubts over the accuracy of the tests. ""We don't know what the protocol was, we don't know whether the test was accurate, we don't know whether we should believe the test,"" said IOC spokesperson Mark Adams. ""There's a difference between a test taking place and whether we accept the accuracy or even the protocol of the test."" This video can not be played Imane Khelif: IOC responds to boxing gender controversy In a statement on Thursday, the IOC said that Khelif and Lin had been ""victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA"". ""Towards the end of the IBA World Championships in 2023, they were suddenly disqualified without any due process,"" the IOC said. ""According to the IBA minutes available on their website, this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA secretary general and CEO. The IBA board only ratified it afterwards and only subsequently requested that a procedure to follow in similar cases in the future be established and reflected in the IBA regulations. The minutes also say that the IBA should 'establish a clear procedure on gender testing'. ""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure - especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years. ""Such an approach is contrary to good governance."" The IBA insisted its decision was ""necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition"". It said in a statement earlier this week: ""The athletes did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test, whereby the specifics remain confidential. This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors."" The IBA said Lin did not ultimately appeal against the IBA's decision to Cas, while Khelif withdrew an appeal, ""thus rendering the decisions legally binding"". In June 2023, 69 of 70 Olympic federations voted to strip the IBA of its status. Before the vote, IOC president Thomas Bach said: ""We do not have a problem with boxing. We do not have a problem with boxers. ""The boxers fully deserve to be governed by an international federation with integrity and transparency."" In response, the IBA accused the IOC of making a ""tremendous error"" and compared the move to Germany's actions in the Second World War. An IBA statement read: ""We have successfully implemented all recommendations outlined by the IOC in its roadmap. ""Despite the challenges, the IBA remains committed to the development of boxing and the organisation of official tournaments and world boxing championships at the highest level. ""We cannot conceal the fact that today's decision is catastrophic for global boxing and blatantly contradicts the IOC's claims of acting in the best interests of boxing and athletes."" Cas rejected an appeal by the IBA against the decision. A new body, World Boxing, was set up in April 2023.  Among five pledges, the new organisation says it will ""keep boxing at the heart of the Olympic movement"" and ""ensure the interests of boxers are put first"". One of its key goals is maintaining boxing as an Olympic sport after it was provisionally dropped from the 2028 Games over the IBA issues. However, it remains in discussions with the IOC to get recognition as the worldwide governing body for the sport. It is backed by representatives from Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Sweden and the United States. The IBA has previously said it ""strongly condemns"" the establishment of a ""rogue"" organisation, adding it has ""initiated a series of actions to protect its autonomy as the official worldwide governing body"". Unlike previous Games, boxing at the Tokyo Olympics was organised by the IOC rather than the IBA. In 2019, the IOC delegated responsibility for the organisation and management of doping control at the Olympics to the International Testing Agency (ITA). The IOC said it took a ""zero-tolerance policy"" to anyone found using or providing doping products. Tests include, but are not excluded to, determining an athlete's levels of testosterone. In late 2021 the IOC issued new guidance on transgender athletes in women’s sport. This placed the responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport. The framework came in the aftermath of Tokyo 2020 when weightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympics in a different gender category to that in which they were born. While the IOC said there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female events, it issued a 10-point document that it expected every sport to apply before Paris 2024. Since then many sports have banned transgender women from taking part in women’s sport, such as athletics, aquatics and both rugby codes. However, the rules have been applied differently so there are sports in which transgender women or athletes with differences of sex development (DSD) can compete. Boxing is one of those as the IOC, which has been overseeing Olympic boxing, has not updated the eligibility criteria rules since Tokyo 2020. The IOC said it ""supports the participation of any athlete who has qualified and met the eligibility criteria to compete in the Olympic Games as established by their IF (international federation). The IOC will not discriminate against an athlete who has qualified through their IF, on the basis of their gender identity and/or sex characteristics."" Both cases had been reported on last year around the World Championships, although not widely in Europe or the US given the boycotts of the event. The IOC included the details on the media information portal before Paris 2024, although that was later removed. Given heightened scrutiny around women’s sport and transgender athletes or people with DSD, media picked up on the IOC saying athletes who had failed the tests were due to compete in the women’s division. Since then the IOC has insisted the fighters were “born women and raised women”, but the IBA has continued to insist its tests suggest their eligibility for women’s boxing is in question. The IBA is holding its news conference on Monday when further details may emerge of the tests from the 2023 World Championships. Khelif and Lin are due to have their semi-final bouts on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, when they could move within one fight of a potential gold medal.

1063,Djokovic beats Alcaraz to win long-awaited Olympic gold,"This video can not be played Emotional Djokovic beats Alcaraz to win Olympic title Novak Djokovic beat Carlos Alcaraz in thrilling fashion to secure a long-awaited Olympic title and complete the career 'Golden Slam'. Djokovic, who has won a men's record 24 majors and swept up every title there is in tennis, finally clinched Olympic gold at his fifth Games. The Serb, 37, put in his best performance of the year to beat French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2) in front of a packed crowd in Paris. He sealed the title with a forehand winner, then turned towards his box - arms outstretched in disbelief - before throwing his racquet to the floor after a draining match which lasted just under three hours. After hugging Spain's Alcaraz, Djokovic immediately burst into tears and fell to his knees in the middle of the court. He then unfurled a Serbian flag and clambered into the stands to celebrate with his family and support team. Djokovic is just the fifth player to win the 'Golden Slam' in singles - all four majors and the Olympic title - after Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf. ""Everything I felt in that moment when I won surpassed everything I thought or hoped that it would,"" said Djokovic. ""Being on that court with the Serbian flag raising, singing the Serbian anthem, with the gold around my neck, I think nothing can beat that in terms of professional sport. ""It definitely stands out as the biggest sporting achievement I have had."" Alcaraz, 21, was also in tears after the match, but will leave with a silver medal on his Olympic debut. Italy's Lorenzo Musetti is the singles bronze medallist, having beaten Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada on Friday.  Novak Djokovic was swept aside by Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final but turned the tables at Roland Garros This moment will mean as much to Djokovic, if not more, than all the Grand Slams, Masters 1,000 titles and ATP tournaments he has won. He left this same court at Roland Garros two months ago needing knee surgery, which put his Olympic dream at risk, and his reaction after Sunday's win showed what it meant. His family watched on from the stands, bearing Serbian flags, with daughter Tara carrying a sign that said ""Dad is the best"". Djokovic has spoken about seeing the Olympics as the pinnacle of sport, and the emotions of representing his country have affected him in his past four Games. He won singles bronze in Beijing in 2008, finished fourth at London 2012, suffered an emotional early loss in Rio in 2016 and lost the bronze-medal match in Tokyo three years ago. However, Djokovic did not drop a set in Paris and was focused from the outset, determined to get his hands on the one prize that had eluded him for so long. The final match itself was a test of his determination - he was on the back foot in the first set but did not give in, saving all eight break points he faced and taking advantage as Alcaraz faltered in both tie-breaks. Asked if he had 'completed' tennis, Djokovic said: ""Yes it’s complete because I completed all the achievements with this gold medal, but no because I love this sport. I don’t play only to win the tournaments. “I don’t know about the future, I really want to be in the present moment to celebrate. It was a long journey, many, many years of dreaming to be holding the gold medal. So now it’s about happiness, joy and celebration.""  How 1999 Nato bombings of Belgrade shaped Djokovic's career It was played in a superb spirit, with both players often left laughing at the quality of the other's shot-making. The crowd was equally split between Spanish fans, decked in flags, and Serbia supporters carrying signs with ""Nole"" - Djokovic's nickname - written on. An electric atmosphere added to the tension - Alcaraz looked the more nervous and had to save a break point in his opening game, but he pushed Djokovic to the limit with his mix of touch and power. However, Djokovic simply would not give in. He played some of his best tennis when down break point and, after taking the first set, was full of confidence. There was the occasional gesture towards his support box - who responded by telling him to keep his head up and stay positive - but on the whole, Djokovic was as dialled in as he has been all year. It has been a difficult season for Djokovic. He lost in the Australian Open semi-finals to Italy's Jannik Sinner, had an indifferent hard court swing, needed knee surgery after injuring himself at Roland Garros and was completely outplayed in his first final of the season at Wimbledon.

1055,Death threats against Olympics organisers investigated,"French prosecutors have opened an investigation into death threats made against the organisers of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.   On Saturday artistic director Thomas Jolly, ceremonies director Thierry Reboul and Alexandre Billard of events agency Ubi Bene, filed a complaint for death threats. Last month, French DJ Barbara Butch, who performed in the opening ceremony's drag queen sequence, lodged a complaint after receiving abuse online. That sequence sparked controversy as some religious officials and conservative politicians in France and abroad saw an offensive reference to The Last Supper. Mr Jolly has said that he was not inspired by the famous Leonardo da Vinci painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles. Instead, he said the sequence, titled Festivity, was inspired by Greek mythology and intended to be a celebration of diversity, adding his intention was not to ""be subversive, nor to mock or to shock"". French prosecutors opened the  investigation after Mr Jolly, who is openly gay, complained of death threats and cyberbullying. Some emails received by Mr Jolly and the head of a production company quoted a verse from the Quran, stating that ""Allah's punishment will befall the organisers in Saint-Denis"" (one of the Olympic sites), Le Parisien newspaper reports. Prosecutors are also investigating insults directed at drag queen Nicky Doll, who also featured in the controversial scene. DJ Barbara Butch told France Inter radio on Sunday that she had received messages ""inviting me to burn in hell in every language and swastikas"".  On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""outraged"" by the cyberbullying directed at Jolly, adding that ""nothing justifies threatening an artist"". ""The French were very proud of this ceremony,"" he said. ""France showed appropriate boldness with artistic freedom.""",2024-08-04 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9e997g3xr1o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1078,'Dream' silver for Rutter despite miss controversy,"This video can not be played GB's Rutter wins skeet silver medal after tense shoot-off loss to Chile's Chadid Great Britain's Amber Rutter says it is a ""dream"" to come away with an Olympic silver medal, despite the controversial end to her gold medal bid in the women's skeet final. The 26-year-old finished tied on 55 shots from 60 targets with Chile's Francisca Crovetto Chadid. They went to a shoot-off and were still tied after three rounds but, in a moment of contention, Rutter was called to have missed a shot which slow motion replays appeared to show she hit. She contested the call, but shooting's version of a video assistant referee or Hawkeye is not in use at the Olympics and the judges did not overturn the decision. Crovetto Chadid, 34, struck with both her next shots to clinch her country's first ever shooting gold medal. BBC commentator Rory McAllister said it was ""a moment of controversy that will be talked about for days and weeks to come"". ""On the slow motion replay we saw the clay had been hit on the right-hand side by Amber Rutter, which is a hit,"" he added. ""You don't have to hit them in the middle."" Former world champion Rutter won silver just over three months after giving birth to her first child, Tommy, and was surprised afterwards by her husband, who had brought their son to Paris. ""It is just a dream,"" she told BBC Sport. ""The fact that I'm able to be a mum and come away with a medal for my country, I am on top of the world right now."" She was forced to miss the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 after contracting Covid-19 on the eve of the Games. ""The fact that I am able to be here, I believe everything happens for a reason,"" added Rutter. ""It really was to prove a point and come back here and really chase down those medals. ""The fact that I am here now, Tommy with me and with an Olympic medal, I don't know how it gets much better than this."" It is Team GB's second shooting medal in Paris after Nathan Hales won gold by setting a new Games record in the men's trap shooting final.

1077,GB's Hepworth takes historic bronze in vault,"This video can not be played Hepworth wins historic bronze Harry Hepworth became the first British man to win an Olympic vault medal with bronze in a high-quality final in Paris. Hepworth's score of 14.949 bettered that of compatriot and reigning world and European vault champion Jake Jarman (14.933), who finished fourth. The Philippines' Carlos Edriel Yulo secured his second gold of the Games (15.116) having topped the podium in the floor event on Saturday, while silver went to Armenia's Artur Davtyan (14.966). ""I don't know how many hours of training have gone into this bit of metal - it's a phenomenal feeling,"" Hepworth said. ""It means the world to me, I've worked my whole life for this. I don't even know what's happening right now."" Hepworth, 20, was second to compete and was left with an agonising wait to find out if those following would jump above him on the scoreboard. Jarman went third and clung on to the bronze-medal position until Davtyan, who vaulted last, finally pushed him off the podium. The pair had already made history by becoming the first GB men to qualify for an Olympic vault final, after Hepworth also became the first Briton to reach the rings final, where he finished seventh (14.800). Today's Olympics guide Full Paris Olympics schedule BBC's Paris Olympics TV schedule Jarman won bronze on floor on Saturday and was expected to add another medal on his favoured apparatus but Hepworth, competing at his first Games, sprung a surprise with two consistent vaults which scored highly for execution. As the youngest member of Great Britain's men's Olympic team, who finished fourth in the team final, Hepworth has shown immense promise at this Games having also reached three apparatus finals in his first World Championships last year. At the age of five, Hepworth was diagnosed with Perthes disease - a condition that effects the hip joint - and was unable to participate in any sport for three years. But a visit to his school from gymnastics coach Craig Richardson inspired him to take up the sport. His condition means one of his legs is four centimetres shorter than the other. But Harrogate-born Hepworth has said he thinks it helps him with his twisting skills. He stated before the Games that his ambition was to one day be Olympic champion in the rings, but he beamed on the podium as he received his vault bronze after showing he is capable of excelling on more than just one apparatus. Earlier, Becky Downie - competing at her third Olympics - finished seventh (13.633) in the uneven bars final after falling during her high-risk routine as Kaylia Nemour secured gold (15.700) to win Algeria’s first ever gymnastics medal. The 32-year-old went all out on difficulty to challenge for the gold medal but missed the bar on 'the Downie' - the move named after her - to put herself out of medal contention. ""As soon as I fell I just felt 'this is how it was supposed to be',"" a tearful Downie told BBC Sport. It had already been an emotional week for the two-time European champion, competing in Paris just over three years after her 24-year-old brother died a week before the Tokyo Olympic trials - which she pulled out of. Tuesday’s team final, where Britain’s women finished fourth, fell on his birthday and Downie said she ""couldn't have done any more"" in Sunday's uneven bars final after a ""hard journey"". She added that it was ""highly likely"" this would be her last competition having competed in her first Olympics 16 years ago. ""Coming into this I knew it was building up towards the end,"" she said. ""I would've loved to finish on a better routine but I feel like you can go forever trying to chase a medal and this is just how it was supposed to be today.""

Hodgkinson, 22, looked effortless as she won her women's 800m semi-final to progress fastest overall in one minute 56.86 seconds at Stade de France. However, team-mates Jemma Reekie and 17-year-old Phoebe Gill did not manage to qualify for Monday night's medal race. Two days before their anticipated 1500m title showdown, world champion Kerr followed Norway's Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen across the line in their semi-final. Ingebrigtsen clocked 3:32.38 to take victory as Kerr chose to track his rival closely on the final lap, crossing just behind in 3:32.46. Team-mate Neil Gourley (3:32.11) also qualified by finishing third in the second semi-final, won by American Yared Nuguse in 3:31.72, but George Mills failed to progress after coming through a repechage round. European record holder Matthew Hudson-Smith and British team-mate Charlie Dobson both won their respective men's 400m heats to qualify for Tuesday's semi-finals. Hudson-Smith, who will seek to upgrade his world 400m silver in Paris, began his bid for gold by taking a comfortable victory in 44.78. Olympic debutant  Dobson, 24, then edged out Belgium's European champion Alexander Doom in 44.96 to move a step closer to the final, which takes place on Wednesday.

1075,Peaty questions China relay win amid doping row,"This video can not be played China pip France to 4x100m relay gold Adam Peaty questioned China's relay victory on the final night of swimming at the Paris Olympics, saying ""there's no point winning if you're not winning fair"". China took gold in a thrilling men's 4x100m medley relay race, beating the United States into second and France third, with the British quartet finishing fourth. Two of the four gold medallists, Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, were among the 23 Chinese swimmers who reportedly returned positive doping tests prior to the Tokyo Olympics. They were not banned because the China Anti-Doping Agency determined they had unintentionally ingested the substance because of contamination. ""If you touch and you know that you're cheating, you're not winning, right?"" said Peaty, who has won three gold and three silver medals for Team GB over his Olympics career. ""I don't want to paint a whole nation or group of people with one brush, I think that's very unfair.  ""To the people that need to do their job - wake up and do your job."" Dressel has doping fears over Olympic swimming Details of the China case were first made public by the New York Times in April, which shared reporting with German broadcaster ARD. The positive tests in 2021 were not made public at the time. The World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) said it was ""not in a position to disprove"" the conclusion made by the Chinada and opted not to appeal after consulting independent experts as well as external legal counsel. An independent report has since found Wada did not show bias in its handling of the case and Chinese athletes were drug tested up to twice as much as other athletes in the run up to the Paris Games. In its initial report, the New York Times also said Qin, who won three breaststroke titles at the World Championships last year, had previously tested positive for another substance. Although it did not name Qin, 25, specifically, Wada said the levels were below the current threshold for reporting and came from eating contaminated meat. Peaty, 29, added: ""One of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is that there's no point winning if you're not winning fair. ""I think you know that truth in your heart. ""For me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honourable person you should be out of the sport. But we know sport isn't that simple."" Following the allegations, the row spread as the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) chief executive Travis Tygart suggested a cover-up - a claim Wada rejected as ""completely false and defamatory"". A criminal investigation is under way in the US over the issue, while a different report into World Aquatics' handling of the case also found there was no mismanagement or cover-up. ""We have to have faith in the system but we also don't,"" said Peaty, who lined up with Ollie Morgan, Duncan Scott and Matt Richards. ""The Americans have been very vocal. We didn't want to get distracted with that. ""But I think it's got to be stricter. What I've said from the start is that it's fraud. If you're cheating, it's fraud."" Peaty won silver in the 100m breaststroke individual event last Sunday Peaty was swimming after what he said was the ""worst week"" of his life physically. He tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, a day after taking silver in the 100m breaststroke event. He did not commit to his future in the sport after the relay, but said ""it could have been"" his last swim. ""I don't know what the answer is,"" he added. Elsewhere, the US set a new world record in the women's 4x100m medley relay, beating great rivals Australia into silver to pip them to topping the swimming medal table for most golds. The Americans leave the pool with eight from 28 medals, while Australia end with seven golds and 18 overall. One of those American golds came in the final individual race as Bobby Finke broke the world record to successfully defend his 1500m freestyle title. He led from the gun to win in 14 minutes 30.67 seconds, taking the record held by Sun Yang – the Chinese swimmer who was given an eight-year doping ban in 2020. Ireland's Dan Wiffen took bronze, his second medal of the week after gold in the 800m freestyle. The star of the meet has undoubtedly been Leon Marchand. He was part of the French relay team beaten by China, but the third place means he adds bronze to his haul of four individual golds. Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom completed the freestyle sprint double by adding the 50m title to the 100m crown she won earlier in the meet. Team GB finished with five medals – the 4x200m freestyle relay their only gold, having set a target of beating or equalling the eight medals won in Tokyo at the previous Games.

1083,Kamala Harris poised to announce her running mate,"Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday morning, ending two weeks of intense speculation as the US hurtles towards November's presidential election.  Ms Harris interviewed several top contenders in Washington DC over the weekend, including Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz and Mark Kelly.  Her choice will join her on a whirlwind five-day tour of seven cities this week as Ms Harris ramps up her campaign in key battleground states.  The most recent poll from CBS, the BBC's US partner, shows Ms Harris and Trump in a tight race nationally, with the Democrat holding a one-point lead over her Republican challenger.   The poll released on Sunday shows Trump and Ms Harris tied in battleground states, where the former president held a five-point lead while Joe Biden remained in the race. Following the announcement expected on Tuesday morning, a campaign video will be released before Ms Harris and her new running mate jointly hold a rally in Philadelphia that evening. She reportedly met her vetting team - led by former US attorney general Eric Holder - over the weekend and received in-depth presentations on their findings, including potential political vulnerabilities.  She met three of those candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - on Sunday.  She also met another top contender - Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - on Friday and is understood to have spoken with other candidates virtually, US media report.  On Monday afternoon, in response to a report that Ms Harris had made her pick, a campaign spokesperson, Kevin Munoz, wrote on social media that she was still deciding.  ""We understand the excitement and interest here, but VP Harris has made no decision on a running mate yet!"" he said.  It comes as the DNC finished a virtual roll call vote that saw Ms Harris officially become the first black and South Asian American nominee for a major US party's White House campaign.  The Harris campaign has met with a flurry of lobbying efforts on behalf of - or criticising - the candidates.  Mr Shapiro, for example, has drawn sharp opposition from some left-wing groups for his support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as well as his pro-Israel views.   The Philadelphia event will be followed by a string of campaign events across Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, before ending with a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10 August.  Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have both  suggested that Ms Harris' choice of running mate will ultimately have no impact on the upcoming election.  In an episode of the ""Full Send"" podcast aired on Friday, Mr Vance said he believed the vice-presidential choice ""doesn't really matter, as much as this hits my ego"".  ""People are going to vote primarily for Donald Trump or for Kamala Harris,"" he said. ""That's the way these things go.""  Similarly, Trump has largely shrugged off questions about Ms Harris's choice, arguing last week that the vice-presidential role ""does not have any impact"".  On Sunday, however, Trump criticised Mr Shapiro on Fox News, saying that Ms Harris could lose ""her little Palestinian base"" if she chooses him.  Mr Shapiro, who during his student days wrote in a college magazine that Palestinians were ""too battle minded"", told reporters on Friday that he now supported a two-state solution.

1095,IBA holds chaotic news conference on Olympic boxing row,"Lin Yu-ting (left) and Imane Khelif are both guaranteed at least a bronze medal in Paris The International Boxing Association held a chaotic news conference on Monday which left more questions than answers over an eligibility row that has overshadowed boxing at the 2024 Olympics. Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting are guaranteed at least bronze medals in the women's competition in Paris, having been cleared to compete in the Games by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). That's despite the pair being disqualified from the 2023 Women's World Championships after the IBA, which organised the event, claimed they had failed gender eligibility tests. The Russian-led IBA, which was stripped of its status as amateur boxing's governing body by the IOC in 2019 because of fears over its governance and regulation, called a news conference in Paris during which president Umar Kremlev and chief executive Chris Roberts were expected to shed new light on the disqualifications. But after technical difficulties delayed the start of the news conference that ran for more than 100 minutes, Kremlev and Roberts gave contrasting and often contradictory accounts about the disqualifications. Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't Roberts claims Khelif and Lin were first tested at the 2022 World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey but no action was taken as the results were ""inconclusive"". He said the fighters' disqualifications from the following year's World Championships in New Delhi, India came after the results showed they were ""ineligible"", in accordance with the IBA rules. ""The results of the chromosome tests demonstrated both boxers were ineligible,"" said Roberts. But while Roberts said the pair had ""chromosome tests"", Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests were to determine the fighters' testosterone levels. Testosterone is a hormone that can increase muscle mass and strength. Chromosomes carry genetic information including a person’s sex. ""They have very high levels of testosterone,"" said Kremlev, who joined via video link and spoke through a translator. ""We got the test results that they allowed us to make and these test results show they have high levels of testosterone, like men."" Kremlev, who also repeated previous criticism of IOC president Thomas Bach, added that if boxers ""want to prove they were born women, they have to do it by themselves"". The IBA said the tests were sent to two different laboratories that are accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). However, Wada has told BBC Sport it does not oversee gender tests and its work only relates to anti-doping matters. The IOC said last week the ""aggression"" aimed towards Khelif and Lin was ""based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure"". The BBC has not seen the results of the IBA eligibility tests and, as yet, has not been able to determine what they consisted of. Many other sports - such as athletics, cycling and swimming - have banned transgender women from competing in women's events and introduced more stringent criteria for athletes with difference of sex development. But in boxing the IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female. Earlier on Monday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams again defended Khelif and Lin's inclusion in the Paris Games. ""These athletes have been competing in senior competitions for six years with no issues,"" said Adams. ""These women were eligible for this contest, remain eligible for this contest and compete in this contest."" Khelif and her team have not yet responded to the IBA, but she has said: ""I want to tell the entire world that I am a female, and I will remain a female."" Algeria’s Olympic Committee (COA) has previously criticised ""malicious and unethical attacks directed against our distinguished athlete, Imane Khelif, by certain foreign media"". Neither Lin nor the Taiwanese Olympic Committee have commented.  BBC Sport's Ade Adedoyin spoke to IBA chief executive Chris Roberts after Monday's news conference. Question: What were the tests you did in 2022? Answer: ""Tests, which are for gender testing, were in 2022 in Istanbul. Those results were done in the laboratory. The results that came out of that identified, in accordance with the rules, an ineligibility to compete."" Q: They were blood tests? A: ""Yes, blood tests."" Q: But you said those blood tests were inconclusive? A: ""Correct. For both boxers."" Q: What did the second blood tests tell you? A: ""Exactly the same. It gave us the same information. With that information, it was then presented to our board of directors to decide, based on our eligibility criteria, what constitutes male and what constitutes female."" Q: So to clarify, the tests you did in 2022 and 2023 were exactly the same? A: ""Yes, correct. They were done through laboratories."" Q: What were those tests designed to show? Your president said they were for testosterone? A: ""It was the chromosome thing. It was to identify that. Effectively gender testing."" Q: What do you mean? A: ""So basically what level of chromosome marries up with XX XY. Based on that criteria. You've seen that in technical competition rules. So if you look at that you'll see what that means."" Q: Umar Kremlev said you tested them for testosterone... A: ""No, the blood tests were done. It was based on the criteria set against… it was a gender test, blood test. I'm not going to state [Kremlev] was wrong."" Q: He said elevated levels of testosterone... A: ""Well, there are elevated levels of testosterone in that testing. It brings out a couple of different things. It identifies different things in that test."" Q: The doctor said they were 'genetically male'. What does he mean? A: ""I don't know. I don't know what his point is on that. You'd have to ask him that. All I'm saying here is tests were conducted in Istanbul, tests were then conducted in India. Results came out. Ineligibility demonstrates against the criteria and therefore that's why the boxers were removed from our tournament."" Q: We hoped for clarity, can see you why confusion has been caused? A: ""We can only take from the tests what they produce. I can't go into that detail."" Q: We are still not exactly clear what the situation is... A: ""I think the situation here is… why don't you ask the boxers? We can't disclose this direct information. It may be worth asking the boxers themselves."" Q: Kremlev said testosterone, you're saying XY chromosome. We are not further forward in understanding... A: ""OK."" Q: Was today shambolic? A: ""In what sense? That you didn't get the information that was needed? We can send this information to you so you can see it."" Q: The labs, were they Wada-accredited? A: ""Yes, accredited. With licence numbers. Correct. The media have brought all of this hype up. Nobody ever said Imane Khelif was a man or the Chinese Taipei boxer, not me."" Q: But your doctor did? Your doctor said they were genetically male... A: ""What did the doctor say? Did he? OK.""

1087,How Lyles' torso decided greatest Olympics 100m final,"This video can not be played Lyles wins 100m gold for USA Was this the greatest race in history? A spectacular pre-race lightshow and dramatic music during a lengthy wait for the starting pistol at an expectant Stade de France heightened the senses. But even those dazzling theatrics could not quite do justice to the events which unfolded in the 10 seconds that followed. As Noah Lyles celebrated wildly, his first Olympic triumph confirmed, others were left stunned after witnessing one of the most remarkable 100m showdowns of all time. American Lyles had taken victory by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish, winning in 9.79 seconds. All eight men finished within 0.12secs of the gold medal, with last-placed Jamaican Oblique Seville crossing the line in 9.91 - a time good enough for fourth at the Tokyo Games. And it meant, for the first time, that eight men had run under 10 seconds in a wind-legal race - making it the fastest race in history. Four-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson said it was ""absolutely"" the best 100m final he has ever seen ""bar none"". ""The final lived up to the hype. Going through the rounds it looked like a foregone conclusion that Kishane Thompson would win as he was the one who came in as the fastest man in the world,"" Johnson said on BBC TV. ""We had this amazing race where you could throw a blanket over the finishing line.  ""We didn't even know who won for a few minutes."" This video can not be played 'He can hold speed and endurance a really long time' - Johnson on Lyles Not until the big screen inside the stadium displayed the official results, after an agonising wait, did anybody truly know Lyles - thanks to a sensational surge and torso dip at the line - had taken gold. It was not until the very last metres on the eye-catching purple track that he was even in contention. Lyles tied with Letsile Tebogo for the slowest reaction time of anyone in the field, a time of 0.178 notably down on Fred Kerley's lightning 0.108. The reaction times off the starting blocks in the men's 100m final Yet Tebogo would go on to cross the line in sixth, while Kerley could only hold on for bronze. ""Lyles didn't even have a medal 10 metres out. He didn't have a hope of winning,"" Olympic medallist Steve Cram said on BBC TV. Lyles was in last place with 40 metres of the race gone. By halfway he was seventh. Where each of the men's 100m finalists reached their top speed in Sunday's showpiece But the 27-year-old hit his top speed of 43.6 kilometres per hour at the 60-metre mark to enter medal contention, then closed far better than any rival to clinch the ultimate prize with his very last stride. Thompson, the fastest man in the world this year with a best time of 9.77, maintained his lead from 30 metres into the race to 10 metres from the finish line. Athlete speeds at the 60m point of the 100m final It was the finest margins which determined the outcome, as Lyles covered the distance between 80-90 metres in 0.84 and the final 10 metres in 0.86 - compared to 0.85 and 0.87 for Thompson. ""I did think [Thompson] had it at the end. I went up to him while we were waiting, and said 'I think you’ve got that, good going', and then my name popped up and I'm like 'oh my gosh, I'm amazing',"" Lyles said. ""I'm going to be honest, I wasn't ready to see it and that's the first time I've ever said that. I wasn't ready to see it."" The photo finish of the men's 100m final - the red lines show that Lyles was the first to break the finish line with his chest, which is the part of the body that counts Reflecting on narrowly missing out on gold, 23-year-old Thompson said: ""I wasn't patient enough with myself to let my speed bring me at the line, in the position that I know I could have gone to, but I have learned from it."" The drama at the head of the race inspired world records behind it. The finishing times for Akani Simbine, Lamont Marcell Jacobs, Tebogo, Kenny Bednarek and Seville were all records for fourth to eighth-place finishers in a 100m race. South Africa's Simbine ran a personal best for fourth and said: ""Missing the medal by 0.01, it's actually really crazy, but yeah, I'm pretty happy."" Lyles has long positioned himself as the heir to Usain Bolt's throne, combining on-track performances with off-track flair in his bid to establish himself as the new superstar of men's athletics. Not afraid to raise expectations through his own comments, Lyles has spoken about his desire to break the long-standing 100m and 200m records set by Jamaica's eight-time Olympic champion Bolt, who retired in 2017. The American has also claimed he will target four golds in Paris by adding the men's 4x400m relay to his schedule after winning the world 100m, 200m and 4x100m title in Budapest 12 months ago. Lyles will next pursue the Olympic 200m title as a three-time defending world champion in the event, although he had to settle for bronze on his Games debut in Tokyo three years ago. ""Lyles had a bad Tokyo and since then he's really been looking for big moments,"" said Johnson. ""He wants to be a global superstar. He talks about Usain Bolt and the type of person he was.  ""He's talked about his sport and voiced his frustration about how it doesn't give you that platform."" This video can not be played Lyles interview after winning 100m gold It is 16 years since Bolt strolled to the first of his three Olympic 100m golds in Beijing, showboating as he crossed the line but still clocking a world record 9.69 - which he improved to the still-standing mark of 9.58 in 2009. Lyles is yet to get close to that time, running under 9.80 for the first time to win on Sunday night, while his 200m best of 19.31 also trails Bolt's (19.19). But, like the Jamaican, Lyles stars on the sport's grandest stages and he continues to amass global golds at a considerable rate. ""Noah Lyles is able to back it up,"" Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis said on BBC TV. ""He has been amplifying the need for people to take this sport more seriously, deliver and respect the athletes for what they deliver, which is sensational entertainment every single time. ""To do this here, with the amphitheatre of the lights, the drama, everything, is just brilliant."" Johnson added: ""He is here to create a legacy and he has put the first stamp down on that legacy by taking this title in such imperious fashion.""

1088,Duplantis breaks pole vault world record on way to gold,"This video can not be played Duplantis secures Gold! Sweden's Armand Duplantis set a new world record of 6.25m after winning gold in the men's pole vault. The 24-year-old, who had secured successive Olympic titles by clearing six metres, set an Olympic record of 6.10m with his next attempt. And he improved his world best of 6.24m, that he set in April, by one centimetre at his third and final attempt, to the delight of the crowd in the Stade de France. The two-time world champion has now broken the record on nine occasions. American Sam Kendricks cleared 5.95m to take silver, while Greece's Emmanouil Karalis secured bronze on countback with a best of 5.90m. Duplantis, the first athlete to retain the pole vault title since American Bob Richards in 1952 and 1956, raced to his friends and family after breaking the world record. He then embarked on a lap of the track draped in the Swedish flag, as Abba's 'Dancing Queen' blasted out of the stadium sound system. Armand Duplantis first broke the pole vault world record in Poland in February 2020 Paris was simply the latest stage for the remarkable Duplantis, who first broke the pole vault world record when it stood at 6.16m in Poland in February 2020. It took him just a week to break the record again in Glasgow, and he's repeated the feat on six further occasions prior to these Olympics. Not since the great Sergey Bukba, who broke the world record on 17 occasions between 1984 and 1994, has the world of pole vaulting seen anyone of his stature, with the American-born athlete set to become one of the great names of track and field. On his way to his many records he has delighted fans and fellow competitors alike, with his rivals at the Stade de France cheering him on his record attempts. ""You can see that they are a band of brothers, they are all willing him on,"" said BBC Sport pundit Dame Denise Lewis.  ""They were chanting 'Mondo! Mondo!' because they just know this is the best they have ever seen."" “I haven’t processed how fantastic that moment was. It’s one of those things that you don’t really feel real, such an out of body experience,"" said Duplantis. ""The biggest dream since a kid was to break the world record at the Olympics, and I’ve been able to do that in front of the most ridiculous crowd I’ve ever competed in front of.” ""You know when Mondo Duplantis is competing, you are always on world record watch,"" said four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson. ""He essentially breaks world records when he wants. He has broken world records at world championships and European championships but this is the Olympics. He loves the big moments and big stages."" Despite being just 24 years of age, Duplantis has a long history of setting world's best marks going back to his childhood. The son of former pole vaulter Greg, an American who competed again Bubka in the 1980s and 90s, and Swedish heptathlete Helena, he first set a world record for the under seven age category. He then set world records at every age group up to under-12 and then from under-17 all the way to senior levels. The missing years 14-16? ""Those were my awkward ages,"" he said. ""I was still short."" It didn't take him long to surpass his father Greg, beating his best clearance of 5.80m at the age of 17. He first broke the senior world record aged 20, beating a mark set by France's Renaud Lavillenie that had stood for nearly six years. Setting a new mark of 6.17m in Poland, he has now progressed the record in one centimetre increments to 6.25m over the course of four and a half years. By way of comparison, it previously took 23 years for the record to move the same distance, from Bubka's 6.07m in 1991 to Lavillenie's 6.16m in 2014. How much higher will Duplantis go?

1086,"Hodgkinson gold, triathlon & kayak drama on Olympics day 10","This video can not be played Hodgkinson wins gold in women's 800m Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson raced to a brilliant victory in the women's Olympic 800m final with a dominant display in Paris. It was Team GB's second gold of the day after Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane broke the world record on three occasions as they powered to glory in the velodrome in the women's team sprint. Joe Clarke had earlier won silver just minutes after fellow Briton Kimberley Woods won bronze in the chaotic kayak cross event. Elsewhere, Simone Biles' ""redemption tour"" concluded with another gymnastics medal, though the American superstar reminded fans she was not invincible during the balance beam and floor finals. Britain also collected a third triathlon medal, but were downgraded from silver to bronze in a dramatic photo finish to an exhilarating mixed relay race. What's happening and when at Paris 2024 Full Paris schedule Paris Olympics medal table Day 10 - live text coverage How to follow Paris 2024 across the BBC This video can not be played Hodgkinson's emotional lap of honour Hodgkinson arrived at the Stade de France carrying a weight of expectation on her shoulders and as a heavy favourite to win Britain's first gold on the track since Mo Farah won two at Rio 2016. If there were any nerves, they barely showed as she delivered a calm and calculated performance to move into the lead before the bell and glide away from the field in the home straight.  The 22-year-old was visibly emotional as she crossed the line and recognised the scale of her achievement that has long appeared her destiny. As a 19-year-old, Hodgkinson took a surprise silver at the Tokyo Games, breaking the British record set by Kelly Holmes in the process. She has since been a runner-up at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and back-to-back World Championships, albeit having also won two European titles. Victory ended her streak of silvers on the global stage, though, and meant she emulated Holmes' achievement in Athens 20 years ago.  Moments later, the Paris crowd were also thrilled by Armand Duplantis, as the Swede improved on his own world record in the men's pole vault final after securing the gold medal. This video can not be played GB break world record to win gold in women's team sprint With Britain having not qualified for the women's team sprint since 2012, Marchant, Capewell and Finucane had expressed a desire to change the narrative around the event. And they did not disappoint, lowering the world and Olympic records twice on the way to the final - though fast conditions also allowed Germany and New Zealand to set new world marks in the first round. Britain were behind on the splits after the first lap in the gold-medal race against New Zealand, but Capewell overturned that deficit and Finucane extended the lead on the last leg to secure GB's first medal in the event. It sparked emotional celebrations in the velodrome with Marchant kissing her two-year-old son Arthur at the side of the track while Capewell broke down in tears. In qualifying for the men's event, Jack Carlin, Ed Lowe and Hamish Turnbull clocked the second-fastest time behind the Netherlands. GB were also second-fastest in qualifying for the men's team pursuit as Dan Bigham, Ethan Hayter, Ethan Vernon and Ollie Wood set a new British record to finish behind Australia on the timesheets. This video can not be played Joe Clarke comes back to claim silver in the kayak While it may not be an event for the purists, the chaotic kayak cross event proved hugely popular in front of packed grandstands on its Olympic debut. And it also delivered more success for GB as world champion Woods, 28, became the first British woman to win two Olympic medals in canoeing having also taken bronze in the women's K1. It was a ""bittersweet"" silver medal for Clarke, who won gold in the K1 in Rio in 2016, before being controversially overlooked for selection for the Tokyo Games three years ago. The 31-year-old went into the men's event as a heavy favourite, with three world titles to his name, but was caught up in traffic early on.  ""It was bittersweet in some ways,"" said Clarke. ""I came for gold but got silver which I am very proud of. ""It was a bit of redemption after missing Tokyo and I think I have put that one to bed."" This video can not be played Woods wins bronze medal US superstar Biles had already won three gold medals at these Games - in the team, all-around and vault events - and was hoping to add two more on day 10. However, the 27-year-old slipped off the beam to miss out on a medal for the first time in Paris. The American lost her balance at the end of an aerial series and placed fifth as Italy's Alice d'Amato won gold, with China's Zhou Yaqin - who had been the top qualifier - taking silver. Biles looked unhappy with the crowd after her routine, speaking animatedly to her coach and team-mate Sunisa Lee, but was all smiles as she re-emerged shortly afterwards for the floor final. She had been the top qualifier, but Brazil's Rebeca Andrade took an early lead and Biles' bid to usurp her fell just short as she paid the price for twice landing with both feet outside the floor area. She still secured her 11th Olympic medal with a silver, while team-mate Jordan Chiles took bronze with the final routine.

1100,Three top contenders emerge in Harris VP hunt,"Kamala Harris could unveil her choice of running mate within hours, after interviewing at least three from her shortlist on Sunday. Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly and Governor Tim Walz had meetings with the presumptive Democratic nominee at her Washington home. Other contenders may have also had interviews virtually over the weekend. Ms Harris will be formally nominated at the top of the ticket later on Monday and then holds her first event with her vice-presidential pick in Philadelphia on Tuesday. She will take on Republican Donald Trump in the presidential election in November.   Here is a look at the names believed to be in the frame to be her running mate, starting with the three interviewed on Sunday. This charismatic and popular governor could help Ms Harris capture Pennsylvania - a must-win for Democrats. The 51-year-old captured national headlines after quickly working to rebuild a collapsed bridge on a pivotal Philadelphia highway last year.  He would be the first Jewish vice-president if chosen by Ms Harris and the Democratic ticket proves victorious.  Mr Shapiro voiced strong support for Israel in the war in Gaza and his criticism of student protests on school campuses in his state could be divisive in the Democratic party and the race for office. Vulnerabilities: Public education advocates have pointed to Mr Shapiro's support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania - a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies - as a potential weakness of Mr Shapiro's.  In mid-July, a group of over two dozen pro-public school groups sent a letter to Ms Harris in which they urged her to pick another candidate who is ""wholly committed to our nation's public education system"".  The swing-state senator has an impressive resume that could appeal to voters on both sides of the aisle.  The former Navy combat pilot and Nasa astronaut has spent more than 50 days in space on multiple missions.  But Mr Kelly, 60, is newer to serving in Washington. He was sworn into office in December 2020.  His wife is Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head 2011 in Arizona while serving in the House of Representatives.   Ms Giffords has since become one of the leading voices on gun safety laws, and the couple's personal story could resonate with voters. Mr Kelly's strong border stance and occasional criticisms of the Biden administration could help appeal to independent and conservative voters.   If chosen, the party would need to fill his Senate vacancy in a key state.  Vulnerabilities: Mr Kelly has already come under some criticism for his role founding World View, a company specialised in high-altitude stratospheric balloons.  The firm received early venture capital funding from Chinese tech giant Tencent, although the company says it has ""zero access, zero input and zero control"" over it. Mr Kelly stepped away from the company in 2019, although he still has a financial stake in it through a blind trust.  Mr Walz is a battle-tested leader who served 12 years in Congress before becoming governor in 2018.  He has gained national attention for his strategy calling Donald Trump and JD Vance ""weird"". The phrase caught on with a number of Democrats - including Ms Harris. ""He's just a strange, weird dude,"" Mr Walz said of Trump during a fundraising event on Monday.  His plainspoken and small-town Midwestern persona could appeal to independent and conservative voters.  The 60-year-old led Minnesota through the 2020 protests over George Floyd's death in Minneapolis He deployed the National Guard to help quell riots that broke out during the demonstrations.  Mr Walz served 20 years in the National Guard, taught high school and also worked as an assistant football coach. Vulnerabilities: Mr Walz's political foes have criticised his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 protests, with Minnesota GOP chairman David Hann recently telling Fox that he believes Mr Walz ""was fearful of alienating his progressive base"" with a more forceful response.  The Democratic governor has been close to Ms Harris for a long time.  Mr Beshear, 46, has been able to carve out a successful career as a Democrat in a state that Donald Trump carried by 20 points in the last election. It is an appealing characteristic that could sweeten the Democratic ticket.  He has given a number of viral interviews criticising Donald Trump's vice-presidential choice, JD Vance, and his opinions on the Appalachia region.  ""He ain't from here,"" Mr Beshear has said of the freshman Ohio senator, calling Mr Vance a fake for his descriptions of the region and its residents in his book, Hillbilly Elegy.  ""This is a guy that used to come a couple weeks a summer, at best, to Kentucky and then wrote a book claiming to know us,"" Mr Beshear told the Des Moines Register.  ""He called my people lazy, and these are the coal miners that built this country.” Mr Beshear often professes his Christian faith and its impact on his personality and work. Supporting public education and protecting abortion access are also key issues for him. Vulnerabilities: In 2023, Mr Beshear drew the ire of some Kentucky Republicans for his veto of a law that banned transgender surgery or drugs involving children. The state's general assembly ultimately overrode his veto and enacted the law.  Campaigning for the White House would not be new for Mr Buttigieg.  As mayor of South Bend, Indiana, he was a surprise favourite of liberal voters in his failed 2020 Democratic primary campaign.  Since then, he has served as federal Transportation Secretary and has become arguably one of the White House's best communicators.  His skill in interviews and before crowds has been on full display in recent weeks as Ms Harris closes in on a running mate.  On the television show Real Time with Bill Maher, he took multiple shots at Mr Vance. Mr Buttigieg said he ""knows"" a lot of people like Mr Vance, who ""would say whatever they needed to"" in order to get ahead.  Mr Buttigieg, 42, pointed out Mr Vance's history of fiercely criticising Trump and how he's now changed his tune to ""get power"".  He also managed a number of public crises in his role as secretary, helping to oversee the response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022. Vulnerabilities:  Some Republicans have criticised Mr Buttigieg for his handling of his role as transportation secretary, saying he took too long to go to East Palestine and has been ineffective when addressing problems facing the US aviation sector.  Conservatives also assailed Mr Buttigieg in 2021 for taking two months' parental leave during a supply-chain crisis.",2024-08-05 23:12:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce4q832w7dgo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1096,"Angered by Paris ban, Russia's media scorns 'the Olympics of Hell'","I’m sailing down the river with an Olympic champion. No, it’s not the Seine. And this isn’t Paris. That’s clear when we cruise past the Kremlin. Below deck, Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Mariya Lasitskene is taking part in the launch of an unusual project: a fusion athletics-fashion show-music event. Mariya is not in Paris defending her Olympic high jump title. Team Russia is barred from these Games because of the war in Ukraine. A World Athletics ruling means that track and field stars from Russia aren’t even allowed to compete as neutral athletes. And, for Mariya, that hurts. “I can’t even bring myself to follow the athletics at these Olympic Games,” she tells me. “It’s too painful. We should be there. The Olympics are a festival, the greatest event in the world.” The Russian press doesn’t seem to think so. From the get-go, newspapers here have been pouring cold water on Paris 2024.  After an opening ceremony featuring drag artists and what some saw as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets dubbed the Paris Olympics ""The Games of Satan"". Another outlet, Argumenty i Fakty, has called them ""The Olympics of hell"". It’s starting to feel like Russia could win the gold... for sour grapes. “I thought the Olympic Games were about sport. No longer,” Russian MP Mariya Butina tells me.  “It’s about politics, religion, everything. It’s very sad because the original idea of the Olympics was to create peace.” “But Russia has invaded Ukraine,” I point out. “That’s not ‘peace’, is it?” “Russia has been protecting its people,” Ms Butina responds, echoing the official line here that Russia’s war in Ukraine is all about self-defence.  In reality, the Kremlin’s ""special military operation"" amounts to the invasion of a sovereign independent nation. In Russia, there was always huge interest in the Olympic Games. But these Olympics are not even being shown on TV here. That hasn’t happened since the Soviet Union boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics 40 years ago. Russia used to send hundreds of athletes to the Summer Games. This time round only 15 Russians have been competing in Paris as ""neutral athletes"" in sports like canoeing and tennis.  They’re not allowed to present themselves a national team, so no Russian flags, no national anthem. And the individual athletes have had to undergo a vetting procedure to establish they have no links to the Russian military or security agencies and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. Bans in sport are nothing new for Russia.  In 2019, the country was barred from major international sporting events for state-sponsored doping offences. That suspension was later reduced to two years. At the Tokyo Games, Russian athletes competed under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. There’s no vetting process at the sports festival I’m witnessing in a Moscow park. A Russian nationalist group has organised an afternoon of what it’s presenting as traditional Russian recreations. It is a world away from Paris 2024. I can see two men lying on the ground engaged in ""stick wrestling"", straining to pull their opponent over. What looks more like a gang fight is raging over on the football pitch, with teams in red and blue bibs engaged in ""wall-to-wall fighting"". Some things here have nothing in common with sport at all. Over in one corner, Russians, young and old, are being invited to don army fatigues and military gear. Posing with guns, they’re having their photographs taken. I detect little interest here in what is going on in Paris. “I haven’t followed the Olympics for ages,” wall-to-wall fighter Vadim tells me. “Not since Russia was excluded from it. Russia’s being cancelled everywhere.” For now, high jumper Mariya Lasitskene has her athletics-fashion show-music event to keep her busy. But Mariya concedes the Olympics are “every professional athlete’s dream"". “Every athlete wants to compete with the best. You can only do that at international competitions,” Mariya tells me.  “Sport is the battle of the strongest. I do miss it.”",2024-08-05 23:12:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwyy9j8wxdo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1106,RFK Jr admits dumping bear carcass in New York's Central Park,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has recounted how he dumped a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park in 2014. The clip, posted on X account on Sunday, shows the independent presidential candidate describing to US actress Roseanne Barr the incident that mystified New Yorkers 10 years ago. Mr Kennedy said a woman had killed the bear with her car when he was driving outside the city, and he put it in his van with the intention of harvesting its meat. He shared the anecdote as the New Yorker magazine published a story about the incident on Monday.  According to the New Yorker, Mr Kennedy was ""tickled"" by the discovery of the bear while heading to a falconry outing in the rural Hudson River Valley.  An image included in the article shows Mr Kennedy grimacing with his hand inside the dead bear's mouth after he loaded the carcass in the back of his car.  The magazine quoted an anonymous source as saying that Mr Kennedy ""thought it would be funny to make it look like an errant cyclist"" had killed it.  The account is broadly similar to the one provided by Mr Kennedy on Sunday. In his video, Mr Kennedy tells Barr that he was driving to go falcon-hunting near Goshen, New York in 2014 when the bear was killed.  ""I was going to skin the bear... and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator,"" he says. ""And you can do that in New York state: Get a bear tag for a roadkill bear."" New York state allows for roadkill to be taken, but authorities must be notified. Mr Kennedy does not appear to have done that.  Instead, he says he continued to his falconry event, then went on to dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse in New York City, about 75 miles (121km) south of Goshen. ""At the end of the dinner, it was late and I realised I couldn't go home,"" Mr Kennedy says. ""I had to go to the airport, and the bear was in my car, and I didn't want to leave the bear in my car because that would have been bad."" That is when, he says, it occurred to him that there had been a series of bicycle accidents in New York and that he had an old bicycle in his car. ""We thought it would be amusing for whoever found it,"" he says.  ""The next day... it was on every television station. It was a front page of every paper and I turned on the TV and there was like a mile of yellow tape and 20 cop cars, there were helicopters flying, and I was like, 'Oh my God. What did I do?'"" He then notes that a fact-checker from the New Yorker called him and asked whether he was involved, which appears to have prompted him to release this video.  The bear's corpse was discovered by a woman walking her dog, The New York Times said in its 2014 story. The carcass had been placed under some bushes and an abandoned bicycle. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation told the BBC on Monday that an investigation determined the bear had died from a high-speed collision. It added that charges cannot be brought for incidents more than a year old. The Times' story from 2014 was written by a one of Mr Kennedy's relatives - Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former president John F Kennedy.  Mr Kennedy's story comes as support for his presidential campaign has dwindled to single digits in polls since Kamala Harris entered the race for the Democrats.  He maintains that he has no intention of ending his presidential bid.",2024-08-05 23:12:01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2j3353vvdvo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

The result means Thierry Henry's side are guaranteed a first medal in the tournament in 40 years when they play Spain at the Parc des Princes on Friday (17:00 BST). Mateta, 27, swept in a late equaliser from Michael Olise's pass to level the scores after Mahmoud Saber had powered in an opener for Egypt from close range in Lyon.  Crystal Palace forward Mateta headed the hosts in front nine minutes into extra time, after Omar Fayed had been dismissed for a second yellow card. Faye's first booking came in second-half stoppage time as he protested against a French appeal for a penalty that was not awarded after a VAR review.

1120,Trump and allies attack Walz as 'dangerously liberal',"The Trump campaign and leading Republicans have launched their first attacks on Tim Walz, labelling him as ""far left"", ""dangerously liberal"" and a ""radical"". Kamala Harris said she chose the Minnesota governor as her running-mate for ""his convictions on fighting for middle class families"".  Donald Trump was quick to claim on social media, without evidence, that Mr Walz would ""unleash HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals"". JD Vance, Trump's choice for vice-president, said that Mr Walz was on the ""far left"" of the Democratic party, and chosen because Ms Harris was a ""radical herself"".  Mr Vance and other Republicans focused on Mr Walz's response to rioting in Minneapolis over the murder of George Floyd in 2020, where he waited two days to deploy the National Guard. Mr Vance said Mr Walz had ""allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020"", a claim echoed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis. ""He sat back and let the city of Minneapolis burn,"" said Mr DeSantis. State officials say several nights of rioting in the Twin Cities destroyed several dozen buildings and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. The killing of Mr Floyd by a police officer sparked nationwide protests over police brutality, with millions demonstrating peacefully. But some protests - in both Democratic and Republic-run states - saw looting, rioting and arson.  Mr Walz also faced criticism for a video from a White Dudes for Harris event last week, during which he said Democrats should not ""shy away from our progressive values"".  “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighbourliness,"" he said, prompting a backlash from Senate Republicans, who wrote in a post on X that Ms Harris and Mr Walz were the ""most extreme ticket in history"".  Other prominent Republicans framed Mr Walz as a weak choice, and claimed he would boost Trump's chances in November's election.  ""Tim Walz?

1119,Harris and Walz attack Trump in first rally as Democratic ticket,"Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, in Philadelphia As they walked out onto the stage, Tim Walz turned to Kamala Harris and mouthed one word: “Wow”. It spoke to the enthusiastic response from the Philadelphia crowd, but also reflected the incredible journey Walz has been on for the past week, from dark horse candidate to vice-presidential pick. After that electric entrance, Walz got a first hand introduction to running-mate obligations - standing behind the presidential candidate and nodding and clapping as they deliver their stump speech. Once it was Walz’s turn to talk, he also showed some of the Midwestern wit that moved him to the top of Harris’s vice-presidential list. 
After noting that violent rates went up under Donald Trump, he added - with a smile - “and that doesn’t even count the crimes he committed”. He repeated his label of his vice-presidential opponent JD Vance as “weird”. And on the topic of abortion, he said the government should follow a Midwestern golden rule: “Mind your own damn business”. The capacity crowd at this 10,000 seat arena, which had been at a frenzied pitch for more than an hour, ate it up. Now the two candidates hit the road, with 91 days left until election day.
“That’s easy,” Walz said of the three-month home stretch. “We can sleep when we’re dead.""",2024-08-06 23:10:33,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c9r3rdkr92pt,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1111,'Good vibes' and midwestern appeal - why Harris picked Walz,"Few people had Tim Walz on their early lists of possible vice-presidential choices.   But sometimes the dark horse wins the race. In a year when ""vibes"" have been everything in politics - on the economy, on the campaign trail - that is exactly what Kamala Harris has gone for: good vibes. The Minnesota governor has a ""midwestern nice"" appeal, even when he is throwing political punches. His background - a teacher, a football coach, an Army National Guard enlisted soldier - broadcasts ""meat-and-potatoes middle America"", as does perhaps his balding, rotund, slightly dishevelled appearance. His affable style and ability to land rhetorical blows on Donald Trump without seeming too aggressive have also brought him to national attention. The ""weird"" label he applied to the former president and his running mate, JD Vance, became a Democratic mantra in just a matter of days - and it is now a standard part of Ms Harris's stump speech. It may prove to be a more effective way to win over undecided voters who were simply not convinced by the dark ""threat to democracy"" rhetoric the Biden campaign had been using. Mr Walz stood in sharp contrast with other possible choices - the polished and ambitious Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, with his arrow-straight military demeanour. He is also a safer pick than the other two, who each held some positions that risked angering portions of the Democratic base.  And while Minnesota is not a battleground state, the Harris campaign may hope that Mr Walz has midwestern appeal in places like Wisconsin and Michigan, which will help decide this election. By taking a Republican-held House seat in 2006, he has already shown he can win round a significant number of rural and Republican voters.  And Mr Walz has proven adept at defending his record of progressive legislation in a way that moderates and independent voters can understand.  Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat grandee who was so instrumental in persuading Joe Biden to step aside for Ms Harris, has been gushing in her praise of the ""wonderful"" Mr Walz. It is no surprise. His 2006 victory helped deliver the House majority to Ms Pelosi as House Speaker, and to the Democrats for the first time in 12 years. Republicans are going to try to erase these early good vibes and replace them with a darker picture.  The Trump campaign has already branded him a ""dangerously liberal extremist"" and a ""far-left lunatic"". JD Vance, his Republican adversary for the vice-presidency, said the choice shows Ms Harris is willing to ""bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party"". Trump claims Mr Walz will unleash ""HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals imaginable"". But making that rhetoric stick on such an affable, meat-and-potatoes persona? Republicans may have their work cut out.",2024-08-06 23:10:33,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jlldpzl7go,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1117,American Cole Hocker claims shock gold in 1500m,"This video can not be played Kerr 'did his best' and secures silver in 1500m final Great Britain's Josh Kerr was made to settle for Olympic 1500m silver behind shock champion Cole Hocker, as Jakob Ingebrigtsen missed out on a medal. As world gold medallist Kerr and defending Olympic champion Ingebrigtsen played out their anticipated battle for the title, American Hocker found his way past both on the inside to clinch his first global outdoor title. With a perfectly timed final surge, Hocker took gold in an Olympic record three minutes 27.65 seconds. Kerr, who upgraded his Olympic bronze from Tokyo, crossed the line in a British record 3:27.79 as another American athlete, Yared Nuguse, ran a personal best 3:27.80 for bronze. Norway's Ingebrigtsen led from the front but faded in the closing stages to miss the podium in fourth, having lost out in successive world 1500m finals to Kerr and fellow Briton Jake Wightman since his Tokyo triumph. ""It’s the fastest I’ve ever run. It’s the best 1500m performance I could ever ask for - a British record and a personal best,"" Kerr said. ""I told you guys we were going to put on a 1500m that would go down in generations and we did that today."" Kerr's spectacular victory in 2023 ignited a fierce rivalry with Ingebrigtsen and the pair have exchanged public comments ever since. The 26-year-old, winner of world indoor 3,000m gold in March, was bidding to become the first British man to win Olympic 1500m gold since Sebastian Coe beat team-mate Steve Cram at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. It was Coe himself, the World Athletics president, who predicted the ""sumptuous"" rivalry - reminiscent of his own with Steve Ovett - could produce ""a race for the ages"" in Paris. But, with the crowd enraptured as the expected tussle played out before their eyes, Kerr edging on to the shoulder of Ingebrigtsen on the final bend, their attention fixed on each other, Hocker stole in to claim a stunning, unforeseen victory. This video can not be played Michael Johnson analyses men's 1500m final Kerr and Ingebrigtsen 'destroy each other' as Hocker rips up script The two gold-medal favourites emerged to an incredible noise inside the Stade de France, both well backed as British and Norwegian flags waved in the stands. Ingebrigtsen, the fourth-fastest man of all-time in the 1500m, was aiming to become the first man since Coe to win successive Olympic titles. Kerr, who visited the stadium last year to picture what his crowning moment would look like, sought to assert himself as the undisputed current king of men's 1500m running. As the Scot came past his main rival in near-identical style to his world triumph at the conclusion of a spellbinding final, the British fans present in huge numbers could sense gold again, one night after Keely Hodgkinson's 800m success. This video can not be played Kerr's reaction to winning silver Those fans, along with Kerr and Ingebrigtsen, had not counted on Hocker crashing the party. At the end of a ferociously fast race, in which Ingebrigtsen set the pace with a 54.9-second opening lap as the two heavyweights fixated on destroying each other, it was Hocker who had the legs to push on. Sixth in Tokyo three years ago and seventh at last year's worlds, this was not an outcome anyone expected, with all the build-up centred on the rivalry which had seen the men's 1500m emerge as the unmissable athletics final at Paris 2024. Lining up with a personal best of 3:30.59, the 23-year-old Hocker improved upon it by almost three seconds as leader Ingebrigtsen turned the screw in trademark fashion. Against the odds, the American seized the biggest opportunity of his fledgling career, raising his arms aloft as he crossed the line to the astonishment of all, with Kerr and Ingebrigtsen in his rear-view. Team GB's Neil Gourley finished 10th, in a time of 3:30.88. ""Of course, I was looking for that gold medal, but it's a better medal than I got three years ago,"" Kerr said. ""It was fast, this crowd was absolutely electric. We went for it, we promised a fast and great race, and that was the result. ""I executed the fastest that I've ever run by almost two seconds. It wasn't enough today. That's sport. I'm very proud of myself. I left no stones unturned and that's the result today."" Ingebrigtsen later admitted his fast start had not been intentional, and ultimately proved his downfall. ""I opened with a 54-second lap. That wasn't the plan at all. It was at least two seconds too fast,"" said Ingebrigtsen, whose winter training was disrupted by an Achilles injury. ""I was thinking about slowing down, but the next lap was almost the same speed.

1126,"Zheng, 11, becomes China's youngest Olympian","This video can not be played Watch Zheng, 11, in action at Paris 2024 An 11-year-old who was born on the penultimate day of the London 2012 Olympics has become China's youngest Olympian. Zheng Haohao was among the competitors in the women's skateboarding park in Paris, which also featured Team GB teenager Sky Brown. Zheng scored a best of 63.19 to finish 18th in the preliminary round - missing out on a final that was won by Australia's Arisa Trew, 14. Having only taken up skateboarding at the age of seven, she leaves France as one of the youngest Olympians of all time. And she has further reason to celebrate this week - she turns 12 on Sunday. Olympic skateboarding has featured a largely youthful field at both of its Games so far. All three medallists in Paris were teenagers, with Brown, 16, and Japan's Kokona Hiraki, 15, repeating their podium finishes from the last Games. Brazil's Dora Varella was the veteran of the event at 23, but skateboarding is not exclusively for the young, with 51-year-old Andy Macdonald set to compete for Team GB in the men's event. Macdonald has won eight gold medals at the X Games - all before Zheng was born. But Macdonald has nothing on the oldest athlete at the Paris Games, with Juan Antonio Jimenez of Spain competing in the equestrian at the age of 65. Zheng, meanwhile, will go down in the history books alongside the likes of Dimitrios Loundras, who took team bronze in gymnastics in 1896 at the age of 10 and remains the youngest confirmed Olympic athlete. His record may have been surpassed by a boy, thought to be seven or eight, who coxed a Dutch boat in Paris in 1900, but his identity remains unknown. Marjorie Gesting of the United States is the youngest female gold medallist in the history of the summer Games, winning 3m springboard diving gold at the age of 13 in 1936. Zheng may not have surpassed her, but a gold in Los Angeles in four years' time would be an excellent 16th birthday present.

1127,Dead bear another strange twist in RFK Jr's faltering campaign,"Robert F Kennedy Jr's independent White House bid was buoyed by Democratic Party chaos and dissatisfaction with two familiar candidates. But bizarre headlines, a new opponent and limited cash have left him struggling. The 70-year-old's recent confession about dumping a dead bear in Central Park is just the latest strange twist to a campaign that was already sagging in the polls. Mr Kennedy seems determined to test the proposition that there’s no such thing as bad publicity. In a move to get ahead of a lengthy profile published on Monday in the New Yorker magazine, he released a video where he discusses an accident involving a bear cub a decade ago – and the unlikely series of events that followed. In the video, Mr Kennedy is speaking to actress and comedian Roseanne Barr over a half-eaten meal of takeaway beef ribs. He describes how he watched a nearby car hit and kill a bear cub while on a day trip hunting with a falcon. He said he initially wanted to take the dead animal home and skin it. After his schedule changed, he decided to discard the carcass in New York City’s Central Park – along with an old bicycle, in an effort to make it look like a cycling accident. When someone discovered the bear and the bicycle the next day, it became a headline story in the New York City tabloids and television news programmes. Needless to say, the entire episode - which sounds like a youthful practical joke gone wrong, but took place when the candidate was 60 - is odd.  The falconry trip. The photograph, published in the New Yorker, of RFK Jr posing with the dead bear. The planned skinning and eating. The animal's final resting place in New York’s famous urban park. Even the video itself with Ms Barr – who has herself been embroiled in more than a few controversies – holding a teacup and nodding along as Mr Kennedy recounted his tale. His explanation, that the decision to pick up the dead bear was his “little bit of redneck” coming out, doesn’t quite fit for the nephew of former President John F Kennedy – a member of an American political dynasty. All this is standard fare for Mr Kennedy, however, whose top news lines during his campaign have veered from scandalous to plain bizarre. In May, the New York Times ran an article revealing he had told lawyers involved in his 2012 divorce proceedings that he was suffering from a memory issue relating to a dead brain parasite. In mid-July, Mr Kennedy texted an apology to a former family nanny after Vanity Fair magazine published a story in which she accused him of unwelcome sexual advances. “I have no memory of this incident but I apologise sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable,” he wrote. In comments to the media, he said the Vanity Fair article contained a lot of “garbage” but conceded that he had a “very, very rambunctious youth” and that he was “not a church boy”.  There was a point earlier this year when Mr Kennedy – who launched his independent presidential bid after initially running for the Democratic nomination – was averaging around 15% in presidential preference polls. He narrowly missed qualifying for the first presidential debate in late June. Mr Kennedy appeared to be capitalising on voter dissatisfaction with both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. His pitch blended anti-establishment and anti-corporate rhetoric with liberal social positions and a heavy dose of environmentalism and controversial vaccine scepticism. With Mr Biden’s dismal performance during that first debate, the door may have opened for Mr Kennedy to elbow his way into the American political conversation. Instead, he virtually disappeared off the presidential campaign trial.  He has spent little on advertising and grassroots organising. His biggest headlines involved the aforementioned brain worms, sex-harassment allegations and bear-cub escapades. Meanwhile, his polling support has dropped to the low single digits. According to Clifford Young, president of Ipsos public affairs, Mr Kennedy’s decline was inevitable, even without all distracting headlines. “He was a protest option,” he said. “There was a lot of indifference when it came to the two candidates. People didn’t like either choice and it was an expression of indifference or disdain.” Now, he says, Democrats and Republicans have consolidated their political support. Mr Kennedy was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the Republican National Convention in late July, where he had a telephone conversation with the former president. According to media reports, Mr Kennedy offered to endorse the former president in exchange for a role in his next administration – an offer Trump declined. At this point, it seems unlikely that Mr Kennedy will generate much interest when Americans head to the polls in November. Even a modest performance could tip the presidential race, however, if that support comes in one of the key battleground states where the independent candidate is on the ballot. In 2016, Green Party candidate Jill Stein received more votes than the difference between Trump and Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – the three decisive states in that race. If a fraction of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader’s Florida support had gone to the Democrats, Al Gore would have won the White House in 2000. Mr Young said Mr Kennedy’s appeal is different from those two notable Green Party candidates, however. He is pulling mostly from the disaffected centre of American politics – low propensity voters who tilt slightly to the right. The Green Party candidates, on the other hand, were damaging the Democrats by pulling almost exclusively from the left. Mr Kennedy could still play the spoiler, but it would have to be another extremely close race. And, in the meantime, his chance to shape his campaign’s direction on a larger scale seem to have been buried under an avalanche of strangeness.",2024-08-06 23:10:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mnn8zneppo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

There was some uncertainty over whether Brown would be fit enough to take part in the final only a couple of hours later, but she made another remarkable recovery to shine at the Place de La Concorde. A sensational final run of 92.31 mved her to third behind 14-year-old Australian Arisa Trew and Japan's Kokona Hiraki, ensuring she added to the bronze she won in Tokyo, when she became GB's youngest medallist aged 13 years and 28 days.

1130,'She did a really smart thing': Democratic voters like Harris's pick,"It's been a busy couple of weeks in American politics since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. On Tuesday, she made her selection for vice-president: Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and a former congressman, teacher and army veteran.  Josh Shapiro and Andy Beshear, the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky, had been in the running, as had Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. The BBC spoke to Democratic voters on what they thought of the choice. Ms Vaughn, who grew up in a Republican household but votes Democrat, wants to see Mr Walz in a debate with Trump's running-mate JD Vance. He's a teacher of 20 years, he's a rural Democrat, I'm a teacher, I'm a rural Democrat. He's an IVF parent, I'm also an infertility parent.  He's a great pick, I think this is going to add a lot of energy to the campaign, he offers so much.  The Harris-Walz ticket is going to be incredibly competitive with the Trump-Vance ticket.  I would love to see the two VP candidates debate. You have someone who is actually from rural America - who still works as a farmer - versus someone who left his rural roots as quickly as he could and then proceeded to profit off of them after his Ivy League education.  Rural communities had [it] really rough under Trump. We lost our child tax credits, IVF has been under attack since Roe [the federal right to abortion] was dismantled. This gives hope that maybe we will have a strong advocate for those aspects of life that are so close to mothers and children and teachers.  Ms Tye initially preferred Mark Kelly as the VP choice but her research on Mr Walz has turned her head.  I'm excited. Walz brings something to the party that Shapiro doesn't and somehow Kelly doesn't seem to either.  He's a fun, engaging guy who gives fun interviews and he has a background that I think a lot of Americans can appreciate.  I think she [Ms Harris] did a really smart thing. Somebody who's a gun guy could bring in some of the people who are really hesitant to vote for an anti-gun Liberal, but Walz has a hunting background and at one point had a positive rating with the NRA.  I really appreciate that he's worked really hard with kids. I love that he facilitated a gay-straight alliance when he was a teacher and he's really worked to make sure that people have a minimum wage that is adequate.  Kamala and Walz will blow the Republicans out of the water.  Mr Chandler thinks Mr Walz is the perfect choice to shore up Democratic support.  Looking at all Walz's policies, he's a very progressive pick.  I really like that he stood up for unions, I really appreciate that he fought so hard for kids to be able to have free lunches in schools in his state.  He has been very adamant about needing peace in Gaza. I'm really happy with the pick because he feels more inspiring, he reminds me of a really nice grandpa, even though he's basically the same age as Kamala Harris.   I like that someone who has been a big proponent of helping people who are struggling is the pick. It's what we need right now in this country.  The Harris-Walz ticket is more representative of the wider American public than the Trump-Vance ticket: it makes me feel a lot more inspired for this election.  Ms Mendenhall said she would have reluctantly voted for Mr Biden and Ms Harris. Now she's excited by the Harris-Walz ticket.  I was pleasantly surprised, it seemed like it was going to go to Josh Shapiro but I think Tim Walz was the better choice.  I don't know that much about him but I know he's been a really good governor in Minnesota and seems to support progressive values.  I'm cautiously optimistic, I know it's going to be difficult, but Walz compared to Vance - there's really no comparison.  I would love to see the two of them debate, I don't know if that will happen, but I do feel pretty good about it.  It's amazing how within a matter of a few weeks the outlook for the election really turned around.  With Biden and Harris there was essentially no hope of winning, but now there is at least a fighting chance to win.

American Thomas, installed as favourite following the pre-competition withdrawal of Jamaica's world champion Shericka Jackson, dominated the final to win in 21.83 seconds. Neita, who also missed out on a 100m bronze by four-hundredths of a second on Saturday, and Asher-Smith were each hoping to become the first British woman to make an Olympic sprint podium for 64 years. But Asher-Smith finished fourth in 22.22 and Neita crossed the line fifth in 22.23, behind runner-up Julien Alfred (22.08) and American bronze medallist Brittany Brown (22.20). Thomas had to settle for world silver behind Jackson last year, having taken Olympic bronze in Tokyo. But coming in as the fastest woman this year, and in the absence of her main rival, the 27-year-old unleashed a triumphant roar across the line and held her hands on her head in disbelief after seizing her moment. ""I've envisioned this race over and over in my head so many times, as I do with every race, and that's how I win races,"" said Thomas. ""But I did not expect to feel how I felt when I crossed that line. ""I couldn't believe it. I never would have imagined in my wildest dreams that I would become an Olympic gold medallist. It was the happiest moment of my life."" It was a second Games medal for runner-up Alfred after the 23-year-old had dominated the 100m final to make history as St Lucia's first Olympic medallist. Behind her was Brown, 29, as she clinched her second global medal – and first since winning world 200m silver behind Asher-Smith in 2019. Neita and Asher-Smith are just edged out in the 200m final Neita, 27, had made no secret of her determination to end her wait for an individual global medal in Paris - and she could not have gone much closer to achieving that. Such are the fine margins in global sprint finals, she has finished a combined 0.07 seconds away from medals in the Olympic 100m and 200m. Having made five global podiums as part of the women's 4x100m relay squad, Neita has made impressive progress since reaching – but finishing last - in the Olympic 100m final in Tokyo three years ago. ""All in all it has been a fantastic Olympic Games for me,"" Neita told BBC Sport. ""I am a double finalist. Fourth place in the 100m by a couple of hundredths and [almost] the same here. I know my time is coming, I have to be a little bit more patient. ""I gave it my all tonight. I'm proud of myself but I really wanted to leave here with an individual medal and I am just hungry."" It is to the relay where Neita's attention now turns, alongside team-mate Asher-Smith. Five years have passed since Asher-Smith, at the age of 23, realised her dazzling potential by becoming the first British woman to win a major global sprint title in this event at the 2019 World Championships. In pursuit of a first Olympic medal, three years after being left in tears when she missed out on the 100m final in Tokyo, the 28-year-old was bitterly disappointed to fall short once again over that distance in Paris. But Asher-Smith ensured a positive end to her individual campaign as she brushed off that setback to produce a strong 200m showing. ""I feel good. It has been a long week and I am proud of that performance,"" she said. ""It was a really strong field, all the girls between them had so many strengths. So many good bend runners, so many amazing finishers and I was really proud that I held my own."" Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith set up his opportunity to race for Olympic 400m gold by cruising to victory in a high-quality semi-final. With three of the six fastest men in the world this year in the same line-up, world silver medallist Hudson-Smith obliterated his competition and eased down before crossing the line in 44.07. However, team-mate Charlie Dobson, making his Olympic debut, missed out on the qualifying positions as he clocked 44.48 for fourth in his race. Grenada's Kirani James, a three-time Olympic medallist in the event, posted the fastest time of the round in 43.78. The men's 400m final takes place at 20.20 BST on Wednesday.

The 27-year-old produced a best leap of 8.14m as Greece's Miltiadis Tentoglou retained his Olympic title by jumping 8.48m. Fellow Briton Elizabeth Bird was seventh in the women's 3,000m steeplechase final, which saw gold go to Winfred Yavi, of Bahrain. Laviai Nielsen suffered heartbreak in the women's 400m hurdles semi-finals as she fell after clipping the final barrier. Team-mate Jessie Knight also failed to qualify, finishing fifth in her semi-final.

1138,Usha Vance defends husband's 'childless cat ladies' remark,"Usha Vance is defending controversial comments made by her husband, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, about ""childless cat ladies"", telling Fox News that she thought critics had taken the remarks too seriously. Mr Vance initially made the controversial remarks in a 2021 interview. He argued those without children shouldn't be leading the country and that women who don't have kids are ""miserable"". The comments resurfaced after former President Donald Trump chose Mr Vance as his running mate. The backlash - from critics including the actress Jennifer Aniston - was swift, and so was Mr Vance's defence of his words. Now, Ms Vance has weighed in, telling Fox News that the remarks were a ""quip"" and she wished people would look at the larger context of what her husband said.  Addressing criticism that his comments were insulting to those who struggle with fertility problems, she said Mr Vance would ""never, ever, ever want to say something to hurt someone who was trying to have a family, who really, was struggling with that"". She said she understands there ""are a lot of other reasons why people may choose not to have families and many of those reasons are very good"". Mr Vance was a candidate for Senate at the time of the 2021 interview, which also happened on Fox News.  He told former channel host Tucker Carlson that the US is run by ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too"". He went on to question why a number of high-profile Democrats do not have children, including Kamala Harris who is now running to replace Joe Biden as president. Ms Harris is a step-mother to her husband Doug Emhoff's two children. JD Vance argued leaders without children were making choices for the future even though they ""don't really have a direct stake in it"".  He also said those without children live in small apartments, chase wealth, careers and ""status"" and then end up ""hating"" those who have families and homes, whom he said are happier and better equipped to lead the country.  Mr Vance, who has three children with Ms Vance, has since defended the remarks - particularly ""childless cat ladies"" - as a ""sarcastic comment"" in service of making his larger point.  ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said,"" Mr Vance told the conservative media personality Megyn Kelly. He said his remarks were not aimed at belittling people who do not have children, rather, they aimed to criticise the ""Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-children,"" he told the host.

1144,Khelif wins again to reach final amid eligibility row,"This video can not be played Algeria's Khelif reaches women's 66kg final Boxer Imane Khelif will fight for an Olympic gold medal on Friday after putting aside the row surrounding her eligibility to comprehensively win her semi-final against Janjaem Suwannapheng in Paris. The Algerian welterweight is one of two boxers competing in Paris despite being disqualified from last year's World Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) after she was reported to have failed gender eligibility tests. Amid wild support under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier - the French tennis venue repurposed for the boxing finals - Khelif dominated her Thai opponent to win by unanimous decision. The win secured progression to her first Olympic final, having been knocked out in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago. She will fight Liu Yang of China in the gold-medal bout, bidding to become Algerian's first boxing gold medallist. ""I am focused,"" the 25-year-old said.  ""I am here for a good performance and my dream. I will give everything I have for the final."" Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? GB's Richardson takes bronze in agonising semi-final loss Harrington defeats Yang to win second Olympic gold Khelif beat Suwannapheng by unanimous decision at last year's World Championships, before being disqualified by the IBA. Here, the crowd chanted her name as she entered the ring - and the Algerian looked more confident than she had at any point this week. After the result was confirmed she dropped her guard and danced on the canvas, and a bout fought in good spirits ended with an embrace between the two fighters. “I had heard about the news regarding her, but I wasn't following it closely,"" Suwannapheng said. ""She is a woman, but she is very strong. I tried to use my speed, but my opponent was just too strong."" Khelif added: ""I am very happy. I am happy for all the support here in Paris.  ""I want to thank all of the people of Algeria who came here."" Khelif's Games began with a win against Angela Carini last week – a fight that lasted just 46 seconds before the Italian abandoned saying she ""had to preserve"" her life. That sparked widespread debate over the eligibility of Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, who was also disqualified by the IBA last year. The IBA said Khelif had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out"" in its regulations, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the pair had been ""suddenly disqualified without any due process"". The IOC, which suspended the IBA in 2019 because of concerns over its finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging, has allowed the pair to compete and strongly backed them. President Thomas Bach said on Saturday there was ""never any doubt"" they are women. A chaotic news conference held by the IBA on Monday did little to lessen the confusion, with key IBA figures giving conflicting statements on why they were banned. The IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female. It will now see Khelif, already guaranteed bronze by reaching this semi-final, in the final of its biggest stage in three days' time. Lin fights in her semi-final in the 57kg category on Wednesday.

An Irene Paredes own goal set Brazil on their way, with Gabi Portilho scoring a second on the stroke of half-time to stun the side that many had tipped as favourites for the gold medal. Adriana added a third for Brazil, who were still without their all-time leading scorer Marta, 38, after she was suspended following her dismissal in the Group C defeat to the Spaniards. While Duda Sampaio headed into her own goal to give Spain hope, Kerolin raced clear in the first of 15 added minutes to score Brazil's fourth before Salma Paralluelo bundled in a late consolation. Spain will now play Germany for the bronze medal in Lyon on Friday (14:00).

1148,Harrington defeats Yang to win second Olympic gold,"This video can not be played Ireland's Kellie Harrington secures gold in women's 60kg final Ireland's Kellie Harrington made history by winning back-to-back Olympic gold medals with victory against China's Wenlu Yang in the women's 60kg final at Roland Garros. After the bout, Harrington said that would be the end of her boxing career and the start of her ""life chapter"" with her partner, Mandy.  And for the 34-year-old, it was the perfect way to go out. In an atmosphere that felt more like Dublin than Paris, Harrington claimed a split 4-1 points decision over Yang. Harrington's gold means Paris 2024 is the most successful Olympics in Ireland’s history - with four golds and three bronze medals. It was fitting that it was Harrington to secure the feat after the Dublin boxer backed up her gold medal from Tokyo three years ago to cement her status as one of Ireland's greatest Olympians. When the decision was announced, the 34-year-old fell to her knees before dancing in the ring as the huge number of Irish supporters started their party in the stands of the Court Philippe-Chatrier. The Irish support swelled to the ring-side rows as the medal ceremony was prepared, with the in-house sound system keeping the waiting fans dancing with hit after hit. When Harrington emerged to receive her gold medal the whistles and cheers were deafening, with the smile on her face visible from everywhere inside the stadium. Harrington then burst into tears as she was declared Olympic champion for a second time as the reality of her achievement began to sink in. Khelif wins again to reach final amid eligibility row GB's Richardson takes bronze in agonising semi-final loss Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? The tears started to flow as Harrington received her gold medal in Paris The Court Philippe-Chatrier, the main arena at Roland Garros, had already reached fever-pitch following Imane Khleif’s semi-final win over Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng. Harrington entered the stadium to a raucous reception by the Irish fans, who dominated the home of French tennis in their numbers with flags and colour. It was a controlled start by Harrington, who let Yang come on to the front foot but the Irish fighter was measured in her approach. Harrington landed a superb blow in the final action of the round, which briefly caused the Chinese fighter to stumble, and she was awarded the round by all but one judge. The second round followed a similar vein, but Harrington stumbled onto the canvas midway through before unleashing a barrage of punches in an immediate response. The scores were split in the second round, but it was Harrington who held advantage heading into the decider with three judges in her favour, while two more scored the fight level. Yang had to come forward in the final round, but again the composure and control by her opponent shone through, as the Irish crowd rose to their feet in the final 10 seconds of the bout. After the bell both fighters shared an embrace, before Harrington walked around the ring with her hands in the air, before dancing with the joyous Irish support who had travelled to the north west of Paris in their thousands. When Harrington won Olympic gold in Tokyo she was awarded the freedom of Dublin. Now, she has enhanced her reputation as one Ireland's sport greats. Along with rowers Paul O’Donovan and Fintan McCarthy, who defended their double lightweight sculls title, and hammer thrower Pat O’Callaghan, who won gold in 1928 and 1932, Harrington is the only other Irish athlete to defend their Olympic title.

1146,GB's Kerr takes 1500m silver as Hocker claims shock gold,"This video can not be played Kerr 'did his best' and secures silver in 1500m final Great Britain's Josh Kerr was made to settle for Olympic 1500m silver behind shock champion Cole Hocker, as Jakob Ingebrigtsen missed out on a medal. As world gold medallist Kerr and defending Olympic champion Ingebrigtsen played out their anticipated battle for the title, American Hocker found his way past both on the inside to clinch his first global outdoor title. With a perfectly timed final surge, Hocker took gold in an Olympic record three minutes 27.65 seconds. Kerr, who upgraded his Olympic bronze from Tokyo, crossed the line in a British record 3:27.79 as another American athlete, Yared Nuguse, ran a personal best 3:27.80 for bronze. Norway's Ingebrigtsen led from the front but faded in the closing stages to miss the podium in fourth, having lost out in successive world 1500m finals to Kerr and fellow Briton Jake Wightman since his Tokyo triumph. ""It’s the fastest I’ve ever run. It’s the best 1500m performance I could ever ask for - a British record and a personal best,"" Kerr said. ""I told you guys we were going to put on a 1500m that would go down in generations and we did that today."" Kerr's spectacular victory in 2023 ignited a fierce rivalry with Ingebrigtsen and the pair have exchanged public comments ever since. The 26-year-old, winner of world indoor 3,000m gold in March, was bidding to become the first British man to win Olympic 1500m gold since Sebastian Coe beat team-mate Steve Cram at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. It was Coe himself, the World Athletics president, who predicted the ""sumptuous"" rivalry - reminiscent of his own with Steve Ovett - could produce ""a race for the ages"" in Paris. But, with the crowd enraptured as the expected tussle played out before their eyes, Kerr edging on to the shoulder of Ingebrigtsen on the final bend, their attention fixed on each other, Hocker stole in to claim a stunning, unforeseen victory. This video can not be played Michael Johnson analyses men's 1500m final Kerr and Ingebrigtsen 'destroy each other' as Hocker rips up script The two gold-medal favourites emerged to an incredible noise inside the Stade de France, both well backed as British and Norwegian flags waved in the stands. Ingebrigtsen, the fourth-fastest man of all-time in the 1500m, was aiming to become the first man since Coe to win successive Olympic titles. Kerr, who visited the stadium last year to picture what his crowning moment would look like, sought to assert himself as the undisputed current king of men's 1500m running. As the Scot came past his main rival in near-identical style to his world triumph at the conclusion of a spellbinding final, the British fans present in huge numbers could sense gold again, one night after Keely Hodgkinson's 800m success. This video can not be played Kerr's reaction to winning silver Those fans, along with Kerr and Ingebrigtsen, had not counted on Hocker crashing the party. At the end of a ferociously fast race, in which Ingebrigtsen set the pace with a 54.9-second opening lap as the two heavyweights fixated on destroying each other, it was Hocker who had the legs to push on. Sixth in Tokyo three years ago and seventh at last year's worlds, this was not an outcome anyone expected, with all the build-up centred on the rivalry which had seen the men's 1500m emerge as the unmissable athletics final at Paris 2024. Lining up with a personal best of 3:30.59, the 23-year-old Hocker improved upon it by almost three seconds as leader Ingebrigtsen turned the screw in trademark fashion. Against the odds, the American seized the biggest opportunity of his fledgling career, raising his arms aloft as he crossed the line to the astonishment of all, with Kerr and Ingebrigtsen in his rear-view. Team GB's Neil Gourley finished 10th, in a time of 3:30.88. ""Of course, I was looking for that gold medal, but it's a better medal than I got three years ago,"" Kerr said. ""It was fast, this crowd was absolutely electric. We went for it, we promised a fast and great race, and that was the result. ""I executed the fastest that I've ever run by almost two seconds. It wasn't enough today. That's sport. I'm very proud of myself. I left no stones unturned and that's the result today."" Ingebrigtsen later admitted his fast start had not been intentional, and ultimately proved his downfall. ""I opened with a 54-second lap. That wasn't the plan at all. It was at least two seconds too fast,"" said Ingebrigtsen, whose winter training was disrupted by an Achilles injury. ""I was thinking about slowing down, but the next lap was almost the same speed.

Brown, 16, was seen clutching the left shoulder she dislocated last week after a heavy fall during Tuesday's preliminary round. But a sensational final run of 92.31 ensured she added to the bronze she collected in Tokyo, when she became GB's youngest medallist aged 13 years and 28 days. ""I feel like this made my story,"" Brown said.  ""I felt the adrenaline and was just hyped up. I didn't even think about it."" Australia's Arisa Trew, 14, took gold at Place de la Concorde with 93.18, as Japan's Kokona Hiraki also repeated her result from three years ago, scoring 92.63 for silver. A new winner had been guaranteed after defending champion Sakura Yosozumi failed to advance earlier in the day.  And Trew, who was sporting her trademark pink helmet, superbly executed a high-risk and high-speed final round to become the youngest medallist at Paris 2024. Zheng, 11, becomes China's youngest Olympian Teenage medal hope Brown cleared to compete after injury Sky Brown, 16, was already Great Britain's youngest Olympic medal winner of all time Brown vowed to ""fight through"" the pain after coming through qualifying and said she would require surgery after the Games. She delivered a display brimming with grit and flair despite performing with heavy strapping. Sitting just outside the podium places after an opening 80.57, she increased the difficulty of her routine with each round and was eyeing an upgrade on her medal from Tokyo 2020 until the last skater, Hiraki, pipped her. Nevertheless the bronze is a remarkable achievement for the British boarder, who only turned her attention and training back to the skatepark when her bid to qualify for the surfing came up narrowly short in March. ""This journey has been crazy with lots of downs but lots of ups,"" she added. ""Since Tokyo I have learned a lot. I was one spot away from qualifying for the surfing. It made me stronger. I am super stoked. I wasn’t even sure I was going to make it here."" A turbulent build-up to Paris also included a tear to the medial collateral ligament in her right knee in April.

Lyles won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday. The 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, finished second in his 200m semi-final in 20.08 seconds to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo. World 100m silver and 200m bronze medallist Tebogo set the fastest time of the round at Stade de France on Wednesday evening, clocking 19.96secs. The Olympic men's 200m final takes place on Thursday at 19:30 BST. Kenneth Bednarek, of the United States, also set a faster time than Lyles, in 20.00, while compatriot Erriyon Knighton, who upgraded to world 200m silver last year, also safely progressed. But Canada's Andre de Grasse will not defend his title in the final after finishing third in his race (20.41). The Olympic 200m bronze winner three years ago, Lyles claimed world 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold in Budapest last year. Following that achievement, when he became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to complete a 100m and 200m world double, he claimed he could look to add the 4x400m relay title to that treble haul in Paris. Jamaican sprint legend Bolt completed individual sprint doubles at three successive Olympic Games among his eight titles, adding relay gold in 2012 and 2016. Only nine men have achieved that double in the history of the Games. Lyles became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, with his narrow triumph. A three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will line up as favourite as he looks to further assert himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.

1162,"Who is Gwen Walz, wife of Harris's VP pick?","America was introduced to a fresh political family on Tuesday when Vice-President Kamala Harris appointed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  While Gwen Walz, the two-term governor's wife, may not officially be on the ticket, her background is getting plenty of attention too.  An educator for more than two decades and life-long Minnesotan, Ms Walz was an agenda setter during her husband's time in office.  She prioritized education and criminal justice reform, initiatives that could see traction in Washington with a Harris-Walz White House.  Ms Walz, 58, met the Minnesota governor when the two were teaching in Nebraska.  They married in 1994 and share two children Hope and Gus.  Mr Walz has previously spoken about the couple's infertility struggles and how they used IVF to conceive.  While Mr Walz created a social-media forward platform for himself during his time as governor, Ms Walz appears to have taken on a less-public role.  She only created an Instagram account in recent days. She also participated in few media interviews as Minnesota's First Lady.  When she does speak publicly, however, it is often about her commitment to education, criminal justice reform and how the two intersect.  ""Education is transformational. And I believe that in every sense of the word,"" Ms Walz said during a 2019 interview with PBS. ""And if we're going to solve problems, we have to look at real ways to solve problems. And education is a real predictor of not going back to prison."" Her first public event as first lady of Minnesota was a rally for restoring convicted felons' voting rights.  Ms Walz also chaired a task force on recidivism and toured state prisons.  “It’s a crucial conversation to have,” Ms Walz said in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio in 2019. “I’m convinced that people are looking for ways to address all kinds of different issues within corrections and within criminal justice.” She is said to advise her husband and she is the first Minnesota governor's spouse to have an office in the state capitol.  Since her launch into national politics this week, she's also been on the receiving end of criticism from the right, especially for comments she made during Minneapolis' 2020 racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd.   In a now viral clip, Ms Walz described the smell of the burning tires and said she kept the window open for as long as she could ""because I felt that was such a touchstone of what was happening"".  Republicans are using the clip to cast Ms Walz, and her husband, as too far-left for voters. ",2024-08-07 23:09:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jpwz19e98o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1167,D'Tigress overcome adversity to shine at Olympics,"D'Tigress are celebrating breaking new ground for Africa at Paris 2024 Nigeria’s historic run in the women’s basketball tournament at Paris 2024 has been underlined by defensive steel, as well as a sprinkling of inspiration from their young coach. The team known as D’Tigress became the first African side - male or female - to reach the quarter-finals of an Olympic Games after beating Canada in their final group game on Sunday. The West Africans registered a win on their Olympic debut in Athens in 2004 but had to wait 20 years for their second victory. The challenge now is to build on their progress. “I'm really proud of them putting Nigeria on the map again after 20 years,” Mfon Udoka, a member of the 2004 squad, told BBC Sport Africa. “I'm just hoping in the near future that it doesn't take another 20 years to see the same success.” However, the squad has had to show plenty of resilience off the court to get to this stage. Since the turn of the millennium Nigeria has emerged as the continent’s dominant side in the women’s game, but the West African nation has failed to translate that success onto the global stage. Their appearance at Tokyo 2020 was overshadowed by disputes over bonus payments and allowances, while governance issues within the national federation cost the team a place at the Fiba World Cup in 2022.  However, their triumphant return to AfroBasket in 2023 set up their recent renaissance. “This programme has been through a lot and we're still striving and fighting,” said Lagos-born guard Elizabeth Balogun. ""We're showing that no matter where you're from, we can compete. It's been a long road and we're still going."" Inadequate support and financial struggles nearly crippled the team, and even before travelling to Paris the side had to deal with another set-back, as captain Sarah Ogoke was forced to withdraw for personal reasons. Power forward Nicole Enabosi believes their performances in France reflects the squad’s fighting spirit. ""This is our job and we have to take care of business,” she said. “No matter what we had to go through, the adversity, we were still able to come out on top. It shows the magic behind basketball.” Rena Wakama has guided Nigeria to continental glory and unchartered territory at the Olympic Games The glue binding this team together is Rena Wakama, the 32-year-old whose journey with the team has been remarkable. In just over a year in charge, as the first female head coach of D’Tigress, Wakama won AfroBasket last year and then secured qualification for the Olympics in February. “I believe her resilience, her hunger to make a name and also prove a point to critics who didn't feel she was good enough to take the job has [made] an impact,” basketball commentator and analyst Queen John-Moseph told BBC Sport Africa. Udoka, who formerly served as an assistant coach with D’Tigress, says Wakama has done an “amazing"" job. “It’s great for her being so young and it just shows the bright future she has,” the former international added. Wakama hopes her journey will inspire people across the continent to go after their dreams and, most importantly, help grow the women’s game. ""If we invest in Africa we're capable of doing amazing things,” she said following their 79-70 victory over Canada. “We have got to put some eyes on Africa and develop the game there. It starts with grass roots.” African basketball is often set around the strategy of 'Take care of your defence and the offence will take care of itself'. Nigeria’s defensive game has certainly caught the eye - particularly their ability to pressurise opponents. It was evident in their opening 75-62 win over Australia, who were forced into 26 turnovers, while D'Tigress lead the tournament in steals. “It has been the strength of this Nigerian team,” John-Moseph said. “It has really helped us. They gave Australia no space at all.” Nigeria have used the aggressive nature of the African game to their advantage, with guard Balogun saying it is “a lifestyle” for the side. “We wake up and do this every day,” the 23-year-old added. “Nigeria is known for aggressiveness, trapping, running.” Meanwhile, a 75-54 defeat in the second group game against hosts France provided food for thought for Wakama. “It humbled us a lot and it made us dig deep and get back to what we did."" Ezinne Kalu, who plays her club basketball in France, is featuring at her second Olympics One figure who has showed up and showed out for Nigeria is point guard Ezinne Kalu. The 32-year-old is averaging 19.3 points per game, and her haul of 21 points against Canada made her the first Nigerian player to score 20 or more points at the Olympics since Mfon Udoka, who managed that feat twice in 2004. “Ezinne has been the heart and soul of the team,” Udoka said. “She's tough, feisty and strong, and has had a really great tournament. The rest of the team follows suit."" Guard Promise Amukamara leads the team in assists, averaging 6.7 per game, while forward Murjanatu Musa has been crucial defensively with an average of 6.7 rebounds per game. D’Tigress now face their toughest challenge yet. The United States, the defending champions, stand in their way at the Bercy Arena on Wednesday (19:30 GMT). America’s women have won the past seven Olympic tournaments, are chasing their 10th gold overall and, with WNBA superstar A’ja Wilson and veterans Breanna Stewart and Jackie Young on their roster, Nigeria seemingly have their work cut out. “We'll definitely play them tough, but I don't know how long that's going to last because we don't have a lot of depth,” Udoka admitted. “The USA, whoever comes off their bench, they keep the same pace, the same momentum.” The encounter is the second Olympic meeting between the two teams, after the US won their clash at the Tokyo Games three years ago, while D’Tigress also suffered a a 100-46 thrashing in February’s qualifying tournament. “You have a lot of assassins on the US [team] to guard,” John-Moseph told Newsday on the BBC World Service. “It’s going to be really tough but the girls have fought hard to come this far. For Wakama, D'Tigress have already done much of the hard work over the last few years. “[There is] no pressure now. We proved to everybody that we should be here.”",2024-08-07 23:09:56,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c0e880eqz5zo,Kelvin Kimathi,2024-08-07 23:09:56,,True
1160,Australian hockey player 'sorry' after Paris cocaine arrest,"Tom Craig was part of the Australia team that won silver at Tokyo 2020 Australia hockey player Tom Craig has apologised after being released from custody in Paris following his arrest for allegedly buying cocaine. The Paris prosecutor's office said an individual was arrested on Tuesday night for buying cocaine in the ninth arrondissement. Craig was released with a warning and did not receive a convinction or a fine. ""I'd firstly like to apologise for what has occurred in the last 24 hours. I made a terrible mistake. I take full responsibility for my actions,"" Craig said as he left police offices. ""My actions are my own and in no way reflect the values of my family, my team-mates, my friends, my sport, and the Australian Olympic team. I've embarrassed you all. I'm truly sorry."" Craig, 28, won silver at the Tokyo 2020 Games and has made more than 100 appearances for Australia. Australia's chef de mission Anna Meares said she was ""glad"" Craig had been released but ""cannot condone"" what he had done. She added: ""He is a good person who made a bad decision. But there are consequences for decisions like this. ""He has apologised, shown remorse, he has owned up to his mistake, and we will support him if he needs help.""

1159,Beijing Olympic skating medals handed out in Paris,"Wednesday's ceremony ended a two-and-a-half-year wait for athletes to receive their medals The reallocated team figure skating medals from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics were finally handed out in Paris on Wednesday at the end of a lengthy doping saga. Skaters from the United States and Japan were given their medals after Russia were dropped from gold to bronze following Kamila Valieva's four-year ban for doping. Canada were left fourth after failing in an appeal to be promoted to third. The USA were awarded gold, with Japan promoted to silver. The Russian Olympic Committee was not represented at the ceremony because of its ongoing suspension by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC decided to wait until Valieva's case had been resolved before handing out the long-awaited medals, with the legal battle leaving the outcome uncertain for two and a half years. Valieva, 18, was banned in January after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. American Madison Chock said it was ""almost surreal"" to finally receive her gold. ""We got our medals, and I turned around and I saw the Eiffel Tower, and I was just blown away,"" she said. ""It took my breath away."" Team-mate Vincent Zhou - a member of the US team who previously said the system was ""failing athletes"" - said he ""almost got used"" to not having the medal. ""To actually have it around my neck now, I don't know how to process it,"" Zhou said.

1157,Vibes and jibes - why Harris picked Walz as running mate,"As they walked out for the first time as presidential running mates on Tuesday night, Tim Walz turned to Kamala Harris and mouthed one word: “wow”. It spoke to the enthusiastic response from the Philadelphia crowd, but also reflected the unlikely journey that the Minnesota governor has been on over the past week. Few people had Mr Walz on their early lists of possible vice-presidential choices. But on Tuesday, the dark horse won the race. In a year when ""vibes"" have been everything in politics - on the economy, on the campaign trail - that is exactly what Kamala Harris has gone for: good vibes. The Minnesota governor has a ""midwestern nice"" appeal, even when he is throwing political punches. His background - a teacher, a football coach, an Army National Guard enlisted soldier - broadcasts ""meat-and-potatoes middle America"", as does perhaps his balding, rotund, slightly dishevelled appearance. All of this was on display here in Philadelphia. After noting that violent crime rates went up under Donald Trump, he added – with a smile - “and that doesn’t even count the crimes he committed”. He called the Republican ticket “weird as hell” –a label that has become a Democratic mantra in just a matter of days. And on the topic of abortion, he said government should follow a midwestern golden rule: “Mind your own damn business”. Mixing humour with jabs - and speaking openly of the “joy” he sees in Democratic politics - may prove to be a more effective way to convince undecided voters who were simply not convinced by the dark “threat to democracy” rhetoric the Biden campaign had been using. Mr Walz’s aw-shucks affability stood in sharp contrast with other possible choices - the polished and ambitious Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, with his arrow-straight military demeanour. Mr Shapiro served as the warm-up act for the new Democratic ticket, and he received a hero’s welcome from his home-state crowd. It was a reminder of what Ms Harris passed over in picking Mr Walz – a popular politician with a silver tongue from perhaps the most important state on the electoral map. Mr Walz was a safer pick than the Pennsylvanian, however, whose criticism of pro-Palestinian protesters and support for using public funds for private schools prompted objections from key parts of the Democratic base. These risked reopening intraparty divisions at a time when Democrats were finally pulling together. And while Minnesota is not a battleground state, the Harris campaign may hope that Mr Walz has midwestern appeal in places like Wisconsin and Michigan, which will ultimately help decide this election. By taking a Republican-held House seat in 2006, Mr Walz has already shown he can win round a significant number of rural and Republican voters. And Mr Walz has proven adept at defending his record of progressive legislation in a way that moderates and independent voters can understand. He’s also a native of Nebraska, which in 2020 delivered one of its electoral votes to Joe Biden. It’s by far the smallest battleground, but in a close race it could be the difference between victory and defeat. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat grandee who was so instrumental in persuading Joe Biden to step aside for Ms Harris, has been gushing in her praise of the ""wonderful"" Mr Walz. It is no surprise. His 2006 victory helped deliver the House majority to Ms Pelosi as House Speaker, and to the Democrats for the first time in 12 years. Republicans are going to try to erase these early good vibes and replace them with a darker picture. The Trump campaign has already branded him a ""dangerously liberal extremist"" and a “far-left lunatic”. They point to his record in Minnesota of enacting left-wing social programmes and accuse him of not doing enough to control the demonstrations that broke out after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020. At the very least, Republicans may welcome not having to face-off against Mr Shapiro, who has a more centrist profile and might have given Ms Harris a decisive boost in Pennsylvania. JD Vance, Mr Walz's Republican adversary for the vice-presidency, said the choice showed Ms Harris was willing to ""bend the knee to the most radical elements of her party"". Trump, meanwhile, said Mr Walz will unleash ""HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals imaginable"". But even if Mr Walz provides a more inviting target for Republicans, making that rhetoric stick on his friendly, meat-and-potatoes persona will be no easy task for the Trump campaign. Now the newly minted Democratic ticket hits the campaign trail, with 91 days left until election day. “That’s easy,” Mr Walz said of the three-month home stretch. “We can sleep when we’re dead”.",2024-08-07 23:09:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jlldpzl7go,Unknown,Unknown,,True

1161,Boxer Lin reaches final amid gender eligibility row,"This video can not be played Lin Yu-ting into women's featherweight final Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting secured a place in Saturday's Olympic women's featherweight final amid the ongoing controversy over her eligibility. Lin and Imane Khelif are competing in Paris despite being disqualified from last year's World Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) after reportedly failing gender eligibility tests. After Khelif secured her place in the welterweight final on Tuesday, 28-year-old Lin reached her own gold-medal match with another comprehensive, unanimous decision victory as she overcame Esra Yildiz Kahraman. As she left the ring, the 27-year-old from Turkey made the same 'X' sign with two fingers as Lin's previous opponent, Svetlana Staneva. Kahraman first held the ropes open for Lin, then returned to the centre of the ring and made the symbol with two of her fingers, turning around to present it to all areas of the crowd. Staneva's 'X' was reportedly said to have symbolised female XX chromosomes. Kahraman did not speak to BBC Sport after the fight. One of her team said ""no comment"" when asked by the media about the meaning of the gesture. Lin will meet 20-year-old Pole Julia Atena Szeremeta, who beat Tokyo silver medallist Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines, in the biggest bout of her career on Saturday. ""I feel very excited and one step closer to my final goal,"" Lin told BBC Sport. Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? Esra Yildiz Kahraman was beaten in the quarter-final of the Tokyo Olympics  Lin has won two golds medals at World Championships but has not contested an Olympic final, having lost in the last 16 to Petecio at the Tokyo Games. At last year's World Championships, Lin reached the semi-finals - thus securing a bronze medal - but was disqualified by the IBA. The IBA said Lin had ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out"" in its regulations. But Lin and Algerian Khelif, who was disqualified from the same tournament, have been allowed to compete at the Olympics, which is run by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC, which suspended the IBA in 2019 because of concerns over its finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging, has strongly backed Lin and Khelif, with president Thomas Bach saying there was ""never any doubt"" they are women. The organisation said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female, and a a chaotic news conference held on Monday did little to lessen the confusion around the IBA's stance as key figures gave conflicting statements as to why the pair were banned.

1169,What it's like to be your country's only Olympian,"As the only athlete sent by his country to the Olympics in Paris, sprinter Shaun Gill has been revelling in his temporary status as “the most famous man” in Belize.  He is one of four athletes sent to the 2024 Games as their nations' sole representative. It is a responsibility that brings pride - and some extra anxiety. Solo competitors told the BBC their jobs could be lonely, but being their nation’s default flagbearer during the opening ceremony had been exhilarating. As a result of Gill's sudden celebrity, others in the athletes’ village have been chasing his autograph, the 31-year-old told the BBC.  “I had a joke with one of my friends that I may need a security detail,” he laughed. The larger Olympic delegations – such as those sent by the US and the UK – are able to choose their flagbearers from groups of hundreds of athletes. But Belize, a Central American nation with a population of less than half a million, had only one candidate - as did Liechtenstein, Nauru and Somalia. Gill waved his country’s flag with all the patriotic zeal he could muster, as he and other athletes paraded along the River Seine in boats. He went viral for his impassioned efforts in the driving rain. Carrying the hopes of a nation was pressurising, Gill admitted. He did not advance to the men’s 100m final, and reflected that jet lag had left him unable to run as fast as he hoped. “When the performance is lacking, I’m like, ‘Man, I hope I didn’t make you all disappointed,’” he said. Somalian runner Ali Idow Hassan is hoping that he manages to do what Gill did not: make it to the medals podium in the Stade de France. If Hassan is fast enough in the men's 800m on Wednesday, he will advance to the semi-finals.  Otherwise, the Olympic medal hopes of the east African nation will be over in little more than 100 seconds: the time it will take for Hassan and his rivals to dash around the track. Some of the world’s smaller nations benefit from universality rules that are designed to ensure a diverse representation of countries during the sporting contest. Hassan, 26, told the BBC he was “very happy” to be his nation’s solitary envoy at Paris 2024, but admitted there was a flipside: “I feel very sad when I’m alone."" But Hassan has befriended athletes from other African countries. The experience of staying in the athletes’ village had been less isolating than might be expected, the competitors agreed.  Romano Püntener, a mountain-biker who represented Liechtenstein on his own, was hunted down in the compound by none other than Andy Murray.  The tennis ace wanted to swap pin-badges with Püntener, knowing that one from Liechtenstein was a rarity. The badges are regularly traded by athletes touring the international circuit. Liechtenstein is a small, land-locked country between Austria and Switzerland, with a population of 38,000 people. Top-level athletes have been few and far between.  The Olympics had been ""unforgettable"" for Püntener, who said he had enjoyed the sheer investment he had received as his country's only hope at the 2024 Games. “It only helped me,” Püntener reflected. “We could really build the whole team around me, and I could decide who I wanted to have with me - and who not.” The 20-year-old finished 28th in last week’s race, his Olympic debut. But since he was not expected to win a medal, he had been able to enjoy himself, and cherish the support of the 20 or 30 compatriots who turned out to cheer him on. Among them was the country’s prime minister. But in a digital age, a deluge of support is capable of becoming a distraction when the sportsmen want to focus on delivering for their countries. “It felt like I got a message from every person living in Liechtenstein,” said Püntener. Gill said he had received “thousands” of well-wishes. “My phone freezes, my Instagram freezes,” he said. “I had to turn it off at one point because I couldn’t even have a moment of peace to myself... I do appreciate it, but I guess I had to just learn how to manage it real quick.” Despite the huge support they may have received, the solitary competitors are running against the odds in many ways. Winzar Kakiouea competed in the men’s 100m race for Nauru, an island in the Pacific that is the world's smallest republic and heavily reliant on aid.  He told the New York Times many people he met had not heard of his country (population: 11,000), which did not even have a proper race track, only a “dirt oval”. When the Games are over, and the spotlight moves on to something else, these competitors will return to lives that may look very different to those lived by the world’s sporting megastars. Gill has chosen to retire from big races and will now focus on training the next generation of runners in Belize, as well as his own future career as an engineer. Püntener will return to his home in Schaan, in the mountains of Liechtenstein, which is perfect for cross-country cycling. “For me, it feels like a big town,” he said. Hassan will go back to training in Ethiopia, though he hopes one day he will live again in his birth city of Mogadishu.  Speaking on the eve of the men’s 800m contest, he was hopeful that improvements in Somalia’s security situation could mean more delegates being sent to future Olympics.  Somalia has a population of 17 million, but has been beset by a civil war for decades. “One day, there will be more athletes,” Nassan predicted. “Ten athletes, 100 athletes will be here.”",2024-08-07 23:09:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxll21leryo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

The American, 27, claimed the 100m title by five-thousandths of a second in a historic final on Sunday. But just four days later he was helped off the track in a wheelchair as Botswana's Letsile Tebogo took the 200m crown, with Lyles having tested positive for the virus early on Tuesday morning. ""It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks,"" said Lyles, who kept the positive test result a secret from his rivals. ""I was coughing through the night.

All seemed well when Lyles came bouncing out on to the track, producing his usual theatrics as he excited the crowd before attempting to become only the 10th man to win 100m and 200m gold at a single Games.

But, after making only the sixth-fastest start in the 200m final, Lyles was unable to make up ground on Tebogo and spent almost the entire race in third, crossing the line behind US silver medallist Kenneth Bednarek. It only became apparent just how much Lyles was struggling once he finished, appearing short of breath before he was helped into a wheelchair after being pictured lying flat-out on the track. “We were trying to keep this close to the chest,"" said Lyles.

""I still wanted to run, it was still possible, we just stayed away from everybody,"" Lyles said. ""This is by far the best day I've felt out of the last three days. Still not 100% but closer to 90 to 95%. ""That only works for one shot. I've got to settle down for a while. It's one and done, there's no holding back."" Defeat in the 200m ended Lyles' ambitious hopes of winning four gold medals in Paris, having had plans to add the 4x400m relay to the world 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble he achieved 12 months ago. Given how he felt immediately after contesting the 200m final on Thursday night, his participation in one or both of those relays could now be in doubt. The 4x100m final takes place on Friday at 18:47 BST, with the 4x400m final held on Saturday at 20:00 BST. ""We haven't decided yet, I'm going to talk to the 4x100m crew,"" Lyles said. ""I'm going to be very honest and transparent with the coaches, and I'll let them make the decision. ""No matter what happens, this 4x100m team can handle everything. I've been with them in practice, I know they can come out with a win, break as many records as they put their mind to."" Noah Lyles had to be helped off the track following the men's 200m final At the Tokyo Games three years ago, postponed one year by the coronavirus pandemic, athletes had to compete in empty stadiums and maintain strict social distancing to tackle the spread of infections. In Paris, while the virus has not disappeared, things have largely returned to normal. Covid is now treated like other respiratory illnesses, with no strict protocols which prevent athletes from competing. USA Track and Field (USATF) told BBC Sport that it and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) ""swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors"" after learning of Lyles' positive test. ""Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,"" USATF said. ""As an organization, we are rigorously adhering to CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], USOPC, and IOC [International Olympic Committee] guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.""

1199,US superstars reach Olympic final after 'special' fightback,"This video can not be played USA comeback from 13-points down to beat Serbia and reach Olympic final A star-studded United States side showed their quality when it mattered as they fought back from a 13-point deficit in the final quarter to beat Serbia in a thrilling Olympic men's basketball semi-final. The vast array of NBA superstars, led by LeBron James and Steph Curry, trailed 76-63 after three quarters. But they turned up the heat and turned around the deficit to win 95-91 at a noisy Bercy Arena. ""To come back the way we did... I've seen a lot of team USA basketball and that was a special,"" said Curry, who finished with game-high 36 points. The comeback maintained the Americans' bid for a fifth successive gold in an Olympic event which they have dominated since it was introduced in 1936. On Saturday, they will play hosts France in the gold-medal match. Serbia, led by Nikola Jokic, the NBA's reigning most valuable player (MVP), must settle for a crack at bronze when they face Germany earlier on the same day. Pretty much every US Olympic squad since the 1992 Games has been compared to the 'Dream Team' led by Michael Jordan and none have ever come close. This Gen Z ensemble cast, featuring four NBA regular season MVP winners - James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid - 11 NBA All-Stars and seven NBA champions, is not far behind. Coach Steve Kerr - himself one of the greatest bosses in NBA history  - wondered how he would knit together five players from a 12-man squad where each could be a future Hall of Famer. Against Serbia it took a while for the individuals to get going as a team with only Curry, finding space to land his trademark three-pointers, keeping them within touching distance. Jokic looked on course to upstage his American opponents, playing a key role as Serbia, who led by as many as 17 points, stifled them in a dominant first half. But, as the US powered back into the game, Serbia faltered. Three-pointers from Durant and Embiid started to turn the tide in the last quarter before James bustled through to put them level at 84-84. Curry landed another from behind the arc as the Americans led with two minutes and 24 seconds left  - the first time they had been ahead since 45 seconds after the game started. With an A-List crowd including Simone Biles, Snoop Dogg and Travis Scott cheering them on, they closed out a memorable victory and danced in celebration on the court. Serbia were unhappy with some of the refereeing decisions in the clutch moments, making their feelings known by lambasting the officials as they walked off the floor.

With jubilant fans celebrating inside the arena, and many more watching television screens outside Parisian bars, France moved into the gold-medal match for the second successive Games. In Tokyo, Les Bleus had to settle for silver as they were unable to end the American stranglehold. France face a tough task to stop them again, although they also have an NBA superstar themselves in 20-year-old Victor Wembanyama. The spindly 7ft 4in centre, known as Wemby or the ‘Alien’ for his height and wingspan, lived up to the hype that preceded his first season at the San Antonio Spurs by winning rookie of the year. His fine year has continued by being at the forefront of his nation’s Olympic run and he says the team will put their bodies on the line in order to beat the Americans. ""In our national anthem, we talk about blood, too. We're willing to spill blood on the court,"" said Wembanyama. ""So it's no big deal. If it allows us to win gold, I'm all for it.""

1200,'Overwhelming' - GB's Aldridge wins kite sailing gold,"This video can not be played Aldridge wins women's kite gold for GB Great Britain's Ellie Aldridge said she ""still can't believe"" she won gold in the women's kite sailing final at Paris 2024, adding it felt ""overwhelming"". The 27-year-old became the inaugural Olympic kite champion by winning two races in the final series on Thursday. Aldridge, who claimed Team GB's 13th gold medal of Paris 2024, said ""the whole thing just feels like a dream"", but also revealed relief at no longer having to ""put on weight"" for the event. ""We use the same equipment as the guys use, and they're all 100 kilos,"" she added. ""It's become pretty obvious in recent years that, the heavier you are, the bigger kite you can hold down, and the faster you'll go. ""Everyone's been trying to put on a bit of weight when they can and it's become just part of the fleet really. It's definitely been the hardest part of my journey. I can't wait to not have to eat food now."" Aldridge also said the equipment for the sports next cycle ""has already been announced"", but hoped for ""different-sized kites or something a bit fairer"" in the future. Three victories are needed in the final series for an athlete to finish first, but Aldridge carried one over from the opening series. She convincingly took the first race of the final and then won the second after leader Lauriane Nolot, of France, fell into the water. Nolot won silver based on her two automatic wins from the opening series and Annelous Lammerts of the Netherlands took bronze thanks to her combined points total. Kite sailing is new to the Olympics, with competitors using a kite to be pulled forward across the water on a board at speeds of up to 45mph (40 knots). Over the first four days, competitors participate in up to 16 races, aiming for the highest possible ranking. The top two riders from this series advance directly to the grand final, while those placed 3rd to 10th proceed to the semi-finals. The eight remaining riders are split into two semi-final groups of equal strength with the objective of winning three races. The higher-ranked riders in each semi-final group start with two race wins, while the second-ranked riders carry over one race success. The winner from each semi-final advances to the grand final. In the conclusion, the leading rider from the opening series starts with two race wins, while the second-ranked rider begins with one. The aim is to achieve three race wins to end the competition.

Aldridge won her first major title at the European Championships in Portsmouth a few months later. The kite event at Paris 2024 has been hampered by low winds, with races seven to 16 cancelled. Aldridge advanced straight to the final as the second-best rider in the opening series behind Nolot. She dominated the first race of the final, leading from start to finish and in the second race benefited from her French rival's fall on the way to a convincing victory.

1201,Johnson-Thompson leads Olympic heptathlon,"This video can not be played Johnson-Thompson leads heptathlon after four events Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson leads the Paris 2024 heptathlon after four events as she seeks a first Olympic medal. The two-time world champion roared with delight after throwing a personal best in the shot put of 14.44m on Thursday evening, before clocking 23.44 seconds in the 200m to move back above rival Nafissatou Thiam. Johnson-Thompson, 31, has 4,055 points - a narrow lead of 48 over Belgium's two-time reigning Olympic champion Thiam, with American Anna Hall 99 behind the Briton. The heptathlon concludes with the long jump (09:05 BST), javelin (from 10:23) and 800m events (19:25) on Friday. Johnson-Thompson led the standings after making a superb start to the competition. Producing season's-best performances in the 100m hurdles and high jump, she led Thiam by just 24 points, with 33 points separating the three pre-competition gold medal favourites. The shot put represents one of Johnson-Thompson's weaker disciplines but she displayed her gold-medal credentials by launching the best throw of her life to ensure she would limit her losses to superior thrower Thiam. The 29-year-old Thiam edged ahead by matching her personal best with an unmatched 15.54m. But Johnson-Thompson, in the event which brought a heartbreaking end to her podium bid in Tokyo three years ago, finished the opening day strongly to reclaim top spot. On her brilliant effort in the shot put, Johnson-Thompson said: ""That was entirely for Denise Lewis sitting in the BBC studio. ""Probably the best thing I've ever done in my career - and I've jumped 1.98m [for high jump]. That topped everything. A little 14m shot put. ""I'm in really good 200m shape so that was really frustrating. I was aiming for as close to 23 seconds as possible but it's the heptathlon, [I was] very tired at the end of the first day so I'll take it."" The reigning world champion called her second global heptathlon triumph in Budapest last year ""the best day of my life"", having completed a remarkable turnaround in her career. Following the maiden global success in 2019, Johnson-Thompson overcame a career-threatening Achilles rupture only to suffer injury heartbreak in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics. Last year, in the absence of the injured Thiam, she took world gold ahead of Hall to set herself up perfectly for the chance in Paris to at last claim an Olympic medal.

Here's what would happen if all three matched their personal bests from here… Long jump (from 09:05 BST) Johnson-Thompson PB: 6.93m (1,202 points) Thiam PB: 6.86m (1,187 points) Hall PB: 6.74m (1,141) Javelin- (from 10:23 BST) Johnson-Thompson PB: 46.14m (822 points) Thiam PB: 59.32m (1,065 points) Hall PB: 45.75m (815 points) 800m (19:25 BST) Johnson-Thompson PB: 2:05.63 (1,064 points) Thiam PB: 2:11.79 (961 points) Hall PB: 2:02.97 (1,110 points) Totals Thiam: 7,220 Johnson-Thompson: 7,143 Hall: 7,022 Also on Thursday, Great Britain's two-time global medallist Laura Muir and Georgia Bell both qualified for the final of the women's 1500m. Drawn in the same semi-final, Bell finished second in three minutes 59.49 seconds, just behind Kenya's two-time reigning Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon (3:58.64), with Muir comfortably through in fourth (3:59.83).

1198,Harris campaign says it doesn't support Israel arms embargo,"Kamala Harris will not support an arms embargo on Israel, her national security adviser says, a day after the presidential candidate was heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters at a rally in Detroit. In a post on Twitter/X, Biden administration official Phil Gordon said Ms Harris ""has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups"". The statement came after leaders of the Uncommitted movement - which has urged Democrats to boycott the election over US support for Israel - said Ms Harris had ""expressed an openness"" to meeting with them to discuss an arms embargo.  Mr Gordon seemed to dispute that report. He added that Ms Harris ""will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law"". His statement comes as tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate. Iran has threatened to ""punish"" Israel after the assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week. Israel has not claimed responsibility.  The US has accelerated its weapon supplies to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attacks. Both Mr Biden and Ms Harris have called for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid in Gaza.  Since Mr Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his second in command, leaders of the Uncommitted movement have been pressing Ms Harris to halt US military support for Israel.  Ms Harris's rally on Wednesday took place in a swing state that is home to the largest Arab-American community in the US.  Leaders of the Uncommitted movement said in a statement that they had a chance to speak to the vice-president before the rally and told her that the US needed an arms embargo. ""We want to support you, Vice President Harris, and our voters need to see you turn a new page on Gaza policy that includes embracing an arms embargo,"" Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of Uncommitted, said he told the Democratic nominee.  Afterwards, a number of pro-Palestinian protestors gathered at the rally and interrupted Ms Harris's speech, chanting: ""Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won’t vote for genocide"". Ms Harris responded by telling the crowd: ""Everyone's voice matters.""  But as the protestors continued to chant, she stopped again and said: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” Both Trump and Ms Harris have made a number campaign stops in the Midwest this week as they try to woo voters in critical swing states.  The latest poll, from Marquette University Law School, shows Ms Harris is leading Trump 53% to 47% among likely voters, a big bump from when Mr Biden was still in the race and was trailing Trump nationally and in several battleground states.

1197,The AI tech aiming to identify future Olympians,"Fans at the Olympics are trying out a new AI-powered talent spotting system that hopes to find the gold medallists of the future. Its developers aim to use a portable version of the technology to bring advanced sport science to remote areas around the world. As the alarm sounds, Tacto races frantically to swipe the infra-red sensors in front of him as some of them suddenly flash blue. Not far away his younger brother, Tomo, sprints down a short running track as his motion is tracked by a series of cameras. The seven and four-year-old siblings from Yokohama, Japan, are taking part in a series of AI-powered tests that have been specially set up near the Olympic Stadium in Paris. The aim of the system is to identify the potential gold medallists of the future. Data is gathered from five tests which include activities like running, jumping, and measuring grip strength.  This information is then analysed to assess a person's power, explosiveness, endurance, reaction time, strength and agility. The results are compared with data from professional and Olympic athletes. “We’re using computer vision and historical data, so the average person can compare themselves to elite athletes and see what sport they are most physically aligned to,” says Sarah Vickers, head of Intel’s Olympic and Paralympic Program. After completing the tests, each participant is told which sport they would be most suited to from a list of 10.  Intel says all the data collected from the people taking part is deleted once the process is complete. Aside from technology, it is something the young brothers are having fun doing.  “I enjoyed it,” says Tacto. “I liked the bit where we had to sprint the best.” The AI system that is open to fans at Paris 2024 has a far smaller, more portable counterpart that can be run on most devices which have a basic camera and a little computing power. “With just a mobile phone or a tablet or a PC you have this opportunity to go into places where you couldn’t go before,” says Sarah. This AI technology can assess people’s performance just by analysing video from the camera without the need for physical sensors. The International Olympic Committee recently took the system to Senegal, where it toured around five different villages and assessed more than 1,000 children on their athletic potential. Partnering with Senegal’s National Olympic Committee, and after a follow-up round of more advanced tests, it identified 48 children with “huge potential”, and one with “exceptional potential”. They have been offered places on sports programmes if they want, to see how far they can take their athletic abilities. It is hoped that the system can be rolled out further and used to offer opportunities to people in areas which it would be impossible to reach with bulkier assessment systems. Prof John Brewer, a visiting lecturer at University of Suffolk, who has worked with England’s Football Association on talent identification, says spotting potential at a young age is the “holy grail” of sport. However, he warns that a basic system that can only measure a few attributes would be limited when it comes to technical sports like football or basketball, or ones that require endurance. “If you want to win the marathon or the 10K you have to have that aerobic capacity, that oxygen transport capacity, that no filming will ever show,” he says. Prof Brewer does see the benefits of the system for making initial assessments of potential athletes. “If they are revealing skill and agility which suggests that they are able to have talent in a particular sport then that has to be encouraged,” he says. “And if it is portable and can be taken to areas where they don’t necessarily have access to high-tech assessment methods, then that can only be a good thing.” “But it would only be one part of a much bigger talent identification system.” Back at the Olympic Stadium, young Tacto has his results - he has been identified as a potential sprinter. He is delighted, although he says he currently prefers football and tennis. Two more experienced athletes are Hank and Brock, who both used to compete for their university in the US at inter-collegiate level. This standard can offer world-class facilities and has produced many Olympians. “We’re former athletes and we’re competitive and thought it’d be fun,” says Hank. “This kind of technology wasn’t around when we were swimming 10 to 15 years ago,” Brock adds. And what were their results? “Rugby,” says Hank.  “I got basketball and I’ve literally never played basketball in my life,” replies Brock. “Well, he played with me once and we never allowed him back,” replies Hank. It seems even with AI technology, computers cannot get it right every time.",2024-08-08 23:10:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmj2jkppvx3o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1202,"He's the new VP pick. To his students, he's Mr Walz","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz could be America's next vice-president. Nobody is more enthusiastic about it than former students in his small-town, midwest classroom. At Mankato West High School, years before he joined the political scene, a young Mr Walz taught geography and social studies, supervised the lunchroom and coached the football team. The Harris campaign has sought to highlight Mr Walz's career as a teacher, even though he served six terms in Congress before he returned to Minnesota to run for governor, a position he's held since 2018.  Those who knew him back then told the BBC that his teaching history is a guide to the politician he has become and the vice-president he could be.  It was 1999 and Jacob Reitan - the first openly gay student at Mankato West - was part of an effort to form the first gay-straight alliance at the school. GSAs, student-run organisations focused on supporting LGBTQ youth, emerged across the country through the nineties. Mr Reitan still remembers the bullying he faced back then, from the homophobic insult spray-painted on his driveway to a smashed-in car window in the school parking lot. But he told the BBC the Walzes promoted inclusion, kindness and ""jointly made the school a place where it was safe to come out"". And because the new GSA required a faculty advisor, Coach Walz stepped up. ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" he said in a 2018 interview, explaining why he took the role. Mr Walz remained a firm supporter of same-sex rights and, in 2011, Mr Reitan stood by the then-congressman's side as President Barack Obama signed his bill repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for gay and lesbian Americans serving in the military into law. ""He's so perfect as an addition to the Harris ticket,"" Mr Reitan said. Introducing him on Tuesday at their first joint campaign event, Ms Harris lavished more praise on Coach Walz than on Governor Walz, his current title. ""Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having, and that every kid deserves,"" she said. ""He's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice-president he will be."" The Trump campaign has assailed Mr Walz as ""a dangerously liberal extremist"" who, along with Ms Harris, forms a ticket that they say is too far left for most Americans to stomach. They have scrutinised his record as Minnesota's governor - from enacting an ambitious left-wing agenda to delaying deployment of the National Guard in response to violent protests following the murder of George Floyd. The Harris campaign is leaning into a biography they believe can win over the rural and working-class voters she needs to defeat Mr Trump this November. While Ms Harris grew up and built her career in liberal California, Mr Walz spent his childhood fishing, farming and hunting in rural Nebraska and came to politics later in life. He joined the National Guard at age 17. For about 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he worked in public high schools - first for a year in China, then in Nebraska and later in his wife's native Minnesota. And former students like Mr Reitan are glowing in their praise for the ex-educator. For brothers Jake and Josh Jagdfeld, attending Mankato West was akin to ""home-schooling with the Walzes"". Josh Jagdfeld took classes with both Tim and Gwen Walz in the 10th grade, and he remembers worrying politics would change his favourite teacher. But when they met on Monday night, Mr Walz greeted him with a shout of ""Mankato West in the building!"" and a big hug. ""He's warm, engaging, cares about everybody he talks to. That's exactly the same Tim Walz I knew,"" Josh Jagdfeld told the BBC. Coach Walz, a defensive coordinator for the school's football team, tapped Jake Jagdfeld as line-backer, putting him ""in a position to succeed"". When Coach Walz joined the team, Mankato West was reeling from a winless 0-27 season. Three years later, it won its first ever state championship. ""Great credit goes to him,"" Jake Jagdfeld said. ""He helped to create an inspirational environment for us young men to feel confident and work hard."" In 2004, Noah Hobbs was in Mr Walz's last geography class before he left teaching. ""He's a very high-energy person, whether school was just starting or it was the end of the day, and that energy was infectious,"" he said. ""The level of care that he gave to all students - not just the kids getting 4.0 [GPAs] - was really impactful for me as a young kid."" Mr Hobbs believes the US is ""looking for someone that is authentic, and Tim embodies that in a way not seen in politics at that level very often"". Mr Walz's evolution from teacher to politician has been described as accidental. In his telling, it stemmed from an incident at then-President George W Bush's 2004 campaign rally in Mankato. He and another teacher chaperoned two students to the event but local organisers refused to let them in. ""They knew we were Democrats,"" Matt Klaber, one of the students, told the BBC. ""At this time, the Bush campaign was turning away any possible protesters from their rallies and this was no exception."" When Mr Klaber pulled out his ID, the staffers observed a faded John Kerry sticker on his wallet. The students were sent home. Mr Walz has described being ""struck by how deeply divided our country was becoming"". He went on to volunteer for the Kerry campaign, develop his own local contacts and then launched a bid for Congress in 2006. ""The news reports say part of what Kamala was looking for was chemistry and a governing partner,"" said Mr Klaber. ""Then picking Mr Walz was a no-brainer. All the good things people have been saying about him as a person are absolutely true."" When Mr Walz arrived on Capitol Hill, new members of Congress were learning in orientation sessions about their salary and benefits. ""They were talking about, ‘I know most of you are taking pay cuts,’” he told local Minnesota television station KSTP. “And I leaned to my aide and said, ‘This is four times what I’ve ever made in my life.’",2024-08-08 23:10:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5rr0rgg3lo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1217,Ngamba beaten but takes refugee team's first medal,"This video can not be played Ngamba claims 'brilliant' boxing bronze Cindy Ngamba was beaten in her boxing semi-final but will still return from Paris 2024 with a historic bronze medal - the first by an athlete from the Refugee Olympic Team. Having already secured a medal by reaching the last four, 25-year-old Ngamba, who lives in the UK and trains with the GB squad, was beaten by Panama's Atheyna Bylon in the 75kg category. Bylon, 35, was penalised a point for excessive holding in the final round of a tight bout before one judge gave Ngamba the win and another sided with her opponent. But the three judges who had previously scored the fight even all ultimately sided with Bylon for a 4-1 victory - a decision that was met with loud boos at Roland Garros Arena. ""They voted for the boxer who was incredibly negative throughout the three rounds,"" BBC boxing expert Steve Bunce said. ""Ngamba is broken and upset. She knows she has done enough to win. ""Bylon picked up a warning and they still gave her the verdict. I find that really, really odd."" Despite being visibly upset and frustrated by the result, Ngamba's place in history remains assured as the first athlete in any sport to secure a medal while representing the refugee team. From Cameroon to handcuffs to Paris Olympics She moved to the UK aged 10 and is unable to return to the country of her birth, Cameroon, because of her sexuality - homosexuality is punishable with up to five years in prison in the African country. Aged 20, Ngamba was arrested, along with her brother Kennet, and sent from Manchester to a detention camp in London and at risk of being deported until being released a day later. She lives in Bolton, where she took up boxing aged 15, and has since graduated from Bolton University with a degree in criminology. She is yet to gain British citizenship, however, which prevented her from being part of Team GB in Paris. She trains with the squad in Sheffield, took part in the pre-Games photoshoot with the British squad and had GB Boxing coaches in her corner against Bylon. The refugee team was first introduced in 2016 for the Rio Olympics but did not win a medal in Brazil or five years later in Tokyo. Their squad is made up of 37 athletes in Paris across 12 sports with Ngamba one of the flagbearers at the opening ceremony. Other athletes include runner Dominic Lobalu, cyclist Eyeru Gebru and Farzad Mansouri, who competes in taekwondo. Elsewhere in Thursday's boxing, Hasanboy Dusmatov won gold for Uzbekistan in the men's 51kg category by beating home favourite Billal Bennama.

There was also success in the velodrome where Emma Finucane took bronze in the women's keirin to win her ""surreal"" second medal at these Games. A good start for Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson means she leads the heptathlon after day one. But there was heartbreak for Jade Jones as she suffered a second successive Olympic first-round loss in the women's under-57kg taekwondo. British team-mate Bradly Sinden cruelly missed out on the podium, having to pull out before a bronze medal bout because of injury. Botswana's Letsile Tebogo claimed a surprise but brilliant Olympic 200m gold at the Stade de France, with Covid-affected 100m winner Noah Lyles leaving the track in a wheelchair after taking bronze.

In doing so she became the inaugural champion, with the discipline making its debut. It is a fast and furious event, with competitors flying above the water on hydrofoils attached to lightweight boards and powered by huge kites at up to 40 knots. Aldridge secured gold by winning two races in the final series on Thursday. The 27-year-old went into the last of those tied on points with France's Lauriane Nolot but behind her on countback. World silver medallist Aldridge led almost from start to finish in the first race of the day and was even more dominant in the second, in which Nolot fell off her board early on to put herself out of contention. Aldridge was able to cruise to the finish line before celebrating her moment of history and Team GB's 50th medal of the 2024 Games.

Tebogo, 21, stormed clear of his rivals to clock an African record of 19.46 seconds and finish ahead of American Kenneth Bednarek, who crossed the line in 19.62 secs. America's sprint showman Lyles, who claimed 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second on Sunday night, burst out on to the track to huge cheers before the race. However, he struggled to compete with those at the front and ultimately matched his Tokyo bronze in 19.70 secs, before receiving medical attention and leaving the track in a wheelchair. US Track and Field then revealed that Lyles had tested positive for Covid and pictured showed he had been wearing a mask before coming out to race. Winner Tebogo, competing in his first Olympics, lost his mother in May and wears her date of birth on his shoes. ""It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field. It gives me a lot of motivation. She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy,"" he said after taking gold.

Twice a world champion, the 31-year-old finished 14th on her Olympic debut in 2012, came sixth four years later in Rio and injury prevented her from finishing in Tokyo three years ago. In the opening discipline - the 100m hurdles - she was eighth fastest overall before going toe to toe with two-time defending Olympic champion Nafissatou Thiam in the high jump. Johnson-Thompson and Thiam were the only two women to clear 1.92m, and while the Belgian won the event as she needed fewer attempts to reach that height it was enough to put the Briton top of the standings after the first two events. And she was top at the end of the day, too, after posting a new shot put personal best of 14.44m, before going on to win her 200m race in 23.45 seconds. Those results put Johnson-Thompson on 4,055 points, 48 ahead of Thiam in second, while Anna Hall of USA sat third on 3,956, with GB's Jade O'Dowda in 17th. The athletes compete in long jump and javelin on Friday morning, before the 800m decides the medals.

However, after losing a tight second round, he received two kicks to the head in the decider and slipped to a 10-2 defeat. That left Sinden facing a bronze medal bout but he was forced to pull out with a knee injury. But Jones' hopes of gold were over at the last-16 stage, as they were in Tokyo. She was beaten 7-6 4-5 1-1 by Miljana Reljikj - who won the tie despite the drawn final round as she landed more hits across the bout. It follows a controversial build-up to the Games for Jones. She was provisionally suspended for failing to provide a sample to testers before being cleared to compete after she was found to having committed a no-fault doping violation on confidential medical grounds.

The 31-year-old Briton was bidding to become the first three-time Olympic champion in the sport's history. She was beaten at the same stage in Tokyo three years ago, which she later described as the ""biggest low"" of her career. On Thursday, Jones lost the first round of the best-of-three tie to Macedonia's Miljana Reljikj, narrowly won the second and drew the third. That led to the number of registered hits being used as a tie-breaker, with Reljikj coming out on top. In the men's 68kg competition, Britain's Tokyo silver medallist Bradly Sinden pulled out of his bronze-medal fight through injury. Jones was cleared to compete in Paris after being found to have committed a no-fault doping violation on confidential medical grounds. The Briton was provisionally suspended by the UK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) after she failed to provide a urine sample to officials who arrived at her hotel in Manchester on 1 December 2023. Ukad said it had been presented with confidential medical records that showed Jones bore ""no fault or negligence for her refusal or failure to submit to her sample collection"". Jones, who tested negative later that day after providing a sample to a separate tester, says she made a ""mistake"" by not providing the sample at the first time of asking.

1220,GB's Finucane takes keirin bronze for second medal,"This video can not be played GB's Finucane wins bronze Great Britain's Emma Finucane took bronze in the women's keirin to win a ""surreal"" second medal of the Paris Olympics. Finucane had been aiming to become the first British female athlete to win three golds in a single Games but had that bid for history ended when she finished behind winner Ellesse Andrews of New Zealand and Dutch silver medallist Hetty van de Wouw. ""I’m just living my little dream to be honest. I can't believe it,"" Finucane, who has another medal chance in the individual sprint, told BBC Sport.  ""To get a bronze medal, it literally feels like gold to me because I left everything out there on the track."" Katy Marchant, who like Finucane was part of the team sprint gold-winning team earlier this week, came fourth. Fellow Briton Ethan Hayter finished out of the medals in the men's omnium, coming eighth in a four-race event won by France's Benjamin Thomas. Portugal's Iuri Leitao took silver and Belgium's Fabio van den Bossche got the bronze.  In the day's other action at the velodrome, Britain's Jack Carlin qualified for the semi-finals of the men's sprint but Hamish Turnbull was eliminated. Finucane was grateful to even make the six-strong final after squeezing through her semi-final in third following a photo finish.  But, starting from the back once the derny - the motorbike that riders have to follow in the order they have drawn for the first three laps - left the track she moved quickly up the field, sitting second until she was pushed into third by Van de Wouw right at the end.   ""It's honestly so surreal,"" she said. ""If you told me a year ago I'd be coming to the Olympics and getting a gold in track sprint and then bronze in keirin, I would've been like 'no way' but here I am."" She was delighted that her family from Wales were in the packed velodrome to witness her latest success. ""That's my whole family, they've come from Carmarthen. To look at them in the crowd and to see the union jack flags and their little faces supporting me whether I win or lose it's about that,"" she said. ""It's about giving back to my family, them watching me with a smile on my face and I couldn't have given any more today."" Finucane's third chance of a medal comes in the women's sprint - an event in which she is the world champion. Qualifying for that starts on Friday, with the final on Sunday.  Hayter was back on the track less than 24 hours after his ""whole body went weak"" and he struggled to hold himself on the bike in the final lap of a pulsating team pursuit final, where Great Britain were beaten by Australia. The 25-year-old, who is a double world champion in the event, had a slow start in cycling’s multi-race omnium. He was 10th after the scratch and tempo races but had put himself into contention for a medal going into the final race by coming first in the elimination race to sit fifth. But he could not build on that momentum in a thrilling 100-lap points race, where winner Thomas recovered from a fall towards the end to take gold in front of his boisterous home fans. ""Today I was on the backfoot and getting my head kicked in,"" Hayter said. ""Definitely I didn't want to be passive, it's not my style. Normally I take it on and batter everyone's heads in, that’s the style and then they start playing the game. I just wasn’t good."" With Finucane's bronze, Great Britain have kept up their record of winning a medal every day in the velodrome in Paris so far. There are more chances to come, including for Carlin after he got a reprieve in the men' sprint quarter-finals.  He had lost his opening race to Kaiya Ota and it had looked like he had also lost the second but the Japanese was relegated after being judged to have impeded the Briton. That put them into a decider, which Carlin won in another feisty race. He will face Dutch defending champion Harrie Lavreysen - who beat Carlin in the Tokyo 2020 semi-finals - on Friday for a place in the final later in the day.

1231,Rapper Travis Scott arrested in Paris over hotel violence,"Rapper Travis Scott has been arrested in Paris after fighting with his bodyguard, according to French authorities. The 33-year-old US star is alleged to have attacked a security guard who attempted to break up the two men at the five-star George V hotel on Friday morning. French prosecutors told the Reuters and AFP news agencies they had opened a criminal investigation into ""unspecified violence"" against the guard. A representative for Mr Scott told BBC Newsbeat: “We are in direct communication with the local Parisian authorities to swiftly resolve this matter and will provide updates when appropriate”. On Thursday evening, Mr Scott, real name Jacques Bermon Webster, was photographed at Team USA's Olympic basketball match against Serbia. He was pictured next to American businessman Michael Rubin and fellow rapper Quavo, former frontman of hip-hop group Migos. Earlier this year Mr Scott was arrested in Miami in relation to an argument on a private yacht. Showbiz news site TMZ has reported that prosecutors dropped a charge of disorderly intoxication against him, but he still faces a count of trespassing. Mr Scott is a 10-time Grammy Award nominee and one of the biggest hip-hop acts in the world. He was previously in a relationship with Kylie Jenner and the pair have two children together. In 2021, 10 fans died in a crowd surge at Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas. He did not face criminal charges over their deaths but remains involved in civil cases alleging that organisers were at fault. Last year he scored his first UK number one album with Utopia, which was released a week after a planned show in front of Egypt's pyramids was cancelled.

Katarina Johnson-Thompson ended her long wait for an Olympic medal with silver in the heptathlon, narrowly missing gold despite posting a personal best in the 800m finale. Another silver went to Team GB's women in the 4x100m relay, before the men's quartet took bronze in their race. There were more medals for Great Britain at the velodrome as Elinor Barker and Neah Evans took madison silver, while Jack Carlin came away with a dramatic bronze in the sprint.

With just two more days of competition left, Great Britain are in a tight battle to finish as the highest European nation in the medal table.

""I am just lost for words. To find out that I had got the gold in that moment was truly incredible,"" Roberts told BBC Sport. ""I have been training for this moment my whole life.

She narrowly missed out on gold to Belgium's history-maker Nafissatou Thiam in a dramatic conclusion to the competition. Two-time outdoor world champion Johnson-Thompson trailed by 121 points - equating to roughly 8.5 seconds - heading into the decisive seventh event. Johnson-Thompson opened a significant lead on Thiam during the 800m and crossed the line in a personal best two minutes 04.90 seconds. That gutsy performance from the 31-year-old was not quite enough, however, and Thiam took gold at the Stade de France by 36 points to become the first woman to win three Olympic heptathlon titles.

There was drama in the men's individual sprint bronze medal race as Britain's Jack Carlin, who was tied at one race win apiece, moved up the track and collided with Dutch rider Jeffrey Hoogland. Already on a yellow warning from an earlier race, Carlin received a reprieve with the race restarted after he was judged to have mistakenly caused the collision and he took advantage to take the bronze medal.

1226,Five Olympic moments from Paris you won't have seen on TV,"For two weeks, the world has come to play in Paris. One of the planet's most stunning cities has played host to the ""crème de la crème"" of Olympic royalty.  National leaders and celebrities have joined the sports stars to strut their stuff, their every move beamed across the globe by the broadcasters gathered here.  But as the athletes like to say, it is often the fans who really complete the Games. That has been all the more true in 2024, with spectators allowed to return to the Olympics en masse for the first time since Covid struck. They have not been awarded medals, but with their quirky displays of passion, patriotism and downright peculiarity, they have provided plenty of highlights. Here are five of the most memorable sights from the French capital that you probably won't have seen on TV. Lamp posts, cycle stands, bins, post boxes: it seemed there was no piece of street furniture that spectators were unwilling to climb to catch sight of the action. It was the first Saturday of sport, and many Parisians were starting to warm to the Games. The cycling time-trial contests were unfolding along some of the city's most beautiful boulevards - and big crowds were beginning to gather.  The most acrobatic - or foolhardy - spectators started scaling any available object to get a better view - performing feats of acrobatics not seen until the Games's official climbing contest began a week or so later.   The sight of residents dangling precariously out of their windows left you wondering what George-Eugène Haussmann, the man who carefully rebuilt Paris in the 19th Century, would make of it all. A legion of picture-takers lined up to get their photos taken with ""Asterix and Obelix"" after a judo final in the nearby Champ de Mars Arena.  If there was a gold for fancy-dress, the French pair would have been in serious contention thanks to their depictions of the legendary comic-book Gaulish warriors. The two men - real names Sebastian and Thomas-Felix - said the Games were showcasing French culture and bringing people together in a party atmosphere. At least everyone could ""cry together"" after losing the men's 60kg judo final, they said. Paris might be known for high fashion, but some of the fortnight's other head-turning looks have included an Egyptian pharaoh costume, various national dresses and headwear inspired by the Games's smiling red-cap mascots.  There was also this man:  Some of the most rousing renditions of the French national anthem heard in Paris have not been in the sporting arenas, but have instead been spontaneous singalongs by wandering French fans draped in their tricolore flags. A version of La Marseillaise belted out on a busy metro train after the opening ceremony surpassed the more mumbly performance heard in the rain-soaked stands of the Trocadéro during the official event. The chanting seemed to encapsulate a nation's relief that the ceremony had been pulled off successfully after so many worries about security and organisation. Later in the Games, social media users observed a perfect pun could be achieved by substituting the tune's marching line with the surname of France's most decorated athlete in Paris. ""Marchons! Oui, marchons!"" is the original. The alternative references swimming sensation Léon Marchand: ""Marchand! Oui, Marchand!"" Expect to hear it at the next Olympics in 2028. The coin-operated telescopes found 115m (380ft) up the Eiffel Tower are typically used by tourists to marvel at some of Paris's other top sights, such as the details on the faraway Arc de Triomphe or the Notre-Dame cathedral.  But the city's world-famous monuments have felt quieter than normal, briefly outshone by exhilarating spectacles of sporting endeavour.  On a woozy Monday afternoon, those sightseers who had assembled on the tower's second-floor viewing platform discovered a clever ruse: the telescopes could be used to spy on a beach volleyball match happening down below. It was possible to witness a thrilling comeback for Spain's women over the Netherlands. It was just one creative way curious bystanders managed to get a glimpse of the sporting action, with all but the priciest tickets often sold out. Many of the Games's volunteers have had a ball in Paris, if the gleeful dancing by a troupe near the Stade de France on one balmy night is anything to go by.  Standing on the concourse of a nearby railway station, the group pulled off a well-choreographed routine to Toto's Africa - all the while waggling their giant foam fingers as they directed punters to the platforms below with megaphones.   Some 45,000 people are said by organisers to have given up their time to help deliver the Olympics and Paralympics - herding people around metro stops, attending to athletes, and chaperoning others around bewildering security cordons. They have even been photographed spraying fans with water to cool them down. In their distinctive turquoise and pink garb, they have frequently been the Games's unsung heroes, and could certainly be allowed a brief evening boogie.

1222,GB win women's 4x100m relay silver and men take bronze,"This video can not be played GB take silver in women's 4x100m relay final Great Britain's women claimed Olympic 4x100m relay silver before the men's team took bronze in two thrilling races at a rain-sodden Stade de France. Dina Asher-Smith, Imani Lansiquot, Amy Hunt and Daryll Neita had two tricky changeovers as the rain fell in Paris but Neita was superb on the anchor leg. She almost overhauled 100m silver medallist Sha'Carri Richardson down the final straight, but the American crossed first in 41.78 seconds. Britain clocked 41.85secs, with Germany third in 41.97. Zharnel Hughes then starred for the men on the anchor leg, securing bronze alongside Jeremiah Azu, Louie Hinchliffe and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake. The United States - without 100m champion Noah Lyles, who contracted Covid-19 earlier in the week - were disqualified for a faulty first changeover. The women's relay silver will be particularly sweet for Neita and Asher-Smith, who missed out on individual medals by narrow margins earlier in the Games. Neita was four-hundredths of a second off the 100m podium in fourth and both she and Asher-Smith were within three-hundredths of a second of a 200m medal. However, both ran superb legs in the relay, with Asher-Smith reaching Lansiquot first, and Neita coming so close to chasing down Richardson after a messy handover between her and Hunt. The American, one of the sport's most engaging athletes, had a quick glance to her right to see the approaching Neita, before finding an extra burst to cross the line in a season's best time. Britain were given a warning for a first lane infringement but, having avoided repeating it, were able to keep their medal. ""I just pushed for home. I was not going to let these ladies down,"" Neita told BBC Sport afterwards. ""For us to be leaving here with a silver medal at the Olympic Games - we're going on the podium, we're representing Team GB and we're just so proud."" Asher-Smith also paid tribute to Bianca Williams and Desiree Henry, who ran in the heats and will also receive medals on the podium. ""This is truly an effort, not just us four here and the two ladies that ran in the heats,"" she added. ""We worked so hard as a women's squad when we didn't make that Olympic Games in 2012 and for the last 10 years we've been pushing because we know that we're this good."" This video can not be played Canada win gold in men's 4x100m relay as GB take bronze The women's team stayed trackside to roar on the men, who faced a difficult task against heavy-hitters the United States. And just as Neita had done, Hughes put in an exceptional final 25 metres, having suffered his own disappointments this week. He failed to reach the 100m final, finishing sixth in his semi-final, and subsequently withdrew from the 200m heats with hamstring tightness. ""My hamstring is heavily strapped but I came out with determination in my heart,"" Hughes told BBC Sport. ""I told the guys before we left the hotel 'hey, I'm going to do my very best to get us on the podium, and you guys do your bit'. ""They did that – they got me the baton and I ran my heart out."" Canada took victory in a season's best 37.50, with South Africa second in 37.57 and Britain third with 37.61. Hughes was part of the GB team that won relay silver in Tokyo three years ago, but they were later stripped of their medals after CJ Ujah tested positive for two banned substances.  Ujah was cleared of intentionally taking prohibited drugs but banned for 22 months. The US will be left to rue their first changeover, with Christian Coleman and Kenny Bednarek essentially running into one another as they attempted to pass the baton. They were later disqualified - meaning they have not won an Olympic title in an event that they previously dominated since 2000, or even a medal since 2004. Nine-time Olympic champion Carl Lewis was heavily critical of the team in a post on X, calling the result ""completely unacceptable"". Coleman defended his team-mates after the race, saying they had ""practised a lot"". ""We're all human beings too and we've been through ups and downs in life, this is another of those,"" he said. ""This is a part of the sport. This is a risk-reward type of thing. We do it on the biggest stage."" Despite the men's disappointment, the US have dominated the track and field events. They have won 29 medals alone in the athletics, including 11 golds - with Canada next best with three golds out of four medals. The US will also be the favourites in the men's and women's 4x400m relays, which take place on Saturday. Rai Benjamin added to the tally with a stunning 400m hurdles gold, running a season's best 46.46 seconds to beat Norway's all-conquering Karsten Warholm. Elsewhere, Ireland's Rhasidat Adeleke narrowly missed out on a medal on her Olympic debut, finishing fourth in the 400m. Britain's Amber Anning was fifth, setting a new national record of 49.29 seconds, as Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic set an Olympic record of 48.17secs to take gold. Kenya's Beatrice Chebet added 10,000m gold to her 5,000m crown in Paris, winning in 30 minutes 43.25 seconds. Italy's Nadia Battocletti took silver while Sifan Hassan, who won gold in the discipline in Tokyo, was third. Team GB's Eilish McColgan, who was unable to run for six months after having knee surgery at the end of 2023, was 15th, with fellow Scot Megan Keith 23rd.

1221,Khelif wins gold amid gender eligibility row,"This video can not be played Algeria's Khelif wins boxing gold in the women's 66kg Imane Khelif won Olympic women's boxing gold a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing a gender eligibility test. The Algerian, amid a controversy that has overshadowed the boxing events in Paris, beat Chinese world champion Yang Liu by unanimous decision to win the welterweight division. The 25-year-old was roared to the ring by swathes of Algerian support - who waved their green, white and red flags - and dominated the fight. She was showboating at the bell, dancing while already knowing the victory was hers, before the pair shared a warm embrace. ""It is my dream. I am very happy,"" Khelif told the BBC. ""It is fantastic. Amazing. ""Eight years of work, no sleep. I want to thank all of the people in Algeria. ""I am very happy for my performance. I am a strong woman."" When the result was confirmed, Yang raised her opponent's arm into the air - a sharp contrast to the scenes after Khelif's opening fight against Italy's Angela Carini - and Khelif was then carried around a jubilant arena on the shoulders of her coach. Lin Yu-ting, the second boxer banned last year under the same ruling, will fight in her final on Saturday but Khelif's Games - one of the most extraordinary and controversial in recent memory - ended with her standing on top of the podium. She was applauded by all three of her fellow medallists and there were tears in her eyes as the Algerian anthem was played. Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? What does science tell us about boxing’s gender row? Carini abandoned in Khelif's opening bout after 46 seconds, saying she had to ""preserve"" her life.  The Algerian, whose previous best result was a world silver in 2022, followed that with convincing, unanimous-decision victories to reach this stage. This was expected to be a tougher bout - Yang represented a step-up in class - but it proved to be another clear victory. Yang was due to face Khelif in the final of last year's World Championship - a title Wang went on to win - but Khelif was disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA), meaning they did not meet. The IBA said Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, who contests her final on Saturday, ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which runs the boxing events at the Olympics, has allowed the pair to compete and strongly criticised the IBA, insisting Khelif and Lin were ""born and raised as women"". President Thomas Bach said earlier on Friday the organisation ""does not like the uncertainty"" but suggested there is not a ""scientifically solid system"" to ""identify men and women"". Khelif won in front of thousands of Algerian fans on court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros - the tennis court that has been transformed into a boxing arena for the Olympics Many of the pair's opponents and coaching teams have been unhappy with their involvement, however, indicating a level of discontent behind the scenes. Carini said it ""was not right"" immediately after her loss to Khelif, although she later apologised for how she handled the moments after the fight. Her coach said he had advised her not to fight, saying people had told her not to ""fight a man"". Before the next round, opponent Anna Luca Hamori from Hungary said: ""I don't think it is fair"", while the Hungarian Boxing Association protested about Khelif's inclusion. After the fight Hamori wished Khelif good luck. Neither her semi-final opponent, Janjaem Suwannapheng, nor the Thailand's boxer team made any direct comment on the controversy, though Suwannapheng said after the fight: ""She is a woman but very strong."" Two of Lin's opponents, meanwhile, have made 'X' gestures - said to be intended to represent female chromosomes - in the ring after defeat. Svetlana Kamenova Staneva left the arena saying ""no, no, no"" and made the 'X' sign.  Before the fight, the Bulgarian had said it was ""not good for boxing"", while her boxing federation said they ""strongly"" opposed Lin and Khelif’s participation in Paris 2024. After Lin's semi-final victory over Esra Yildiz Kahraman, the Turkish fighter also made the 'X' sign in the centre of the ring.

1243,Nigeria's Olympic cyclist thanks German team for bike loan,"Nigeria's first ever Olympic cyclist has praised the German team for giving her a bike to compete with in the Paris 2024 Olympics after she was unable to source one of her own. Ese Ukpeseraye had initially only been registered for the women's road race but competed in two track events - which require a different kind of bike - at ""short notice"", she said on social media platform X. The 25-year-old wrote that with no bicycle to race with and in the spirit of sportsmanship the German team had come to her rescue. Her post prompted several Nigerians online to question the competency of their national sports authorities, but Nigeria's sports minister insisted the situation was unavoidable. John Owan Enoh said the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world's foremost cycling authority, offered Nigeria last minute slots in two women's track events ""due to the disqualification of a country"". The offer was made after Ukpeseraye and the rest of Team Nigeria had arrived in Paris for the games, Mr Enoh said. ""For this track race reallocated to Team Nigeria, a very special equipment (approved specifically for the Olympic track game) is used,"" he posted on X. ""It'll take months to have it delivered after ordering and making payment."" Online commenters remained sceptical, however. Some linked Ukpeseraye's case to incident earlier on in the games, where Nigerian sprinter Favour Ofili discovered last minute that she could not race in the women's 100m as she had been left off the entry list. ""I would have asked what happened to Favour Ofili who missed her 100m race because whoever was supposed to fill in her name for the competition failed to do so. Does that also take months to import?"" one X user wrote. Others asked why Nigeria was yet to win any medals at this year's games. It is an outcome even Nigeria's government seems frustrated by - the information ministry touched on ""the disappointing performances of Nigerian athletes"" in a recent press release. In this year's games, Ukpeseraye became the first Nigerian - man or woman - to compete in a cycling event. Her first event was the women's road race, but she was among a number of athletes who failed to complete the 154km (96-mile) route. ""It was an honour to represent Nigeria at this level. Although I couldn’t finish the race, being here is a victory in itself,"" she is quoted by the Nigerian media as saying. Ukpeseraye also missed out on the finals of the two track events she competed in -  she finished sixth in her keirin heat and 28th in the sprint qualifiers. However, she remains proud of her achievements, writing on X that she has ""set the ball rolling for cycling in Nigeria"". Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

1242,Refugee b-girl disqualified for message at Olympics,"The International Olympic Committee bans political statements at the Olympics Refugee athlete Manizha Talash was disqualified for displaying the words ""free Afghan women"" on her outfit during her Olympic breaking battle in Paris. The Afghan, who was competing for the Refugee Olympic Team as B-girl Talash, had the message emblazoned in large letters on a cape she wore in her pre-qualifying battle against India of the Netherlands as the dance sport made its Games debut. Talash lost but was later also disqualified because political statements and slogans are banned on the field of play at the Olympics. ""I wanted to show people what is possible,"" she told reporters. Talash, originally from Kabul, lives in Spain and is one of 37 athletes competing for the refugee team. She fled Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power in 2021 and effectively banned music and dancing, and barred females from classrooms and gyms.  The Taliban say they respect women's rights in line with Sharia law. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter states ""no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas"". It says if there is a breach, each incident will be evaluated by their respective National Olympic Committee, International Federation and the International Olympic Committee, and disciplinary action will be taken on a case-by-case basis as necessary. Talash was eliminated from the competition before the round-robin stage but her message will have been seen on the biggest stage her sport has ever been on.

1244,Trump fights for spotlight as Democrats dominate coverage,"On Thursday, Donald Trump walked into a room of journalists gathered at his Mar-a-Lago estate for a news conference. He didn’t look particularly happy. His remarks came after a week in which Kamala Harris and her new running mate Tim Walz have dominated media attention, raked in millions of dollars and enjoyed a bump in polling. Trump's media event seemed more an attempt to win back the spotlight than announce anything new. Just before Trump stepped up to the podium, one of his advisors texted me the wry assessment that Donald Trump is ""never boring!!"" (the exclamation marks were his). The event included a couple of news items. Trump announced that he'd agreed to join a TV debate with Vice-President Harris on 10 September. ABC News, the debate host, confirmed that Ms Harris had agreed to participate as well.  Trump also said he'd like to do two more debates. There's no word from the Harris team yet on whether they’ve accepted those additional matchups. Over the course of the hour-long event, Trump took dozens of questions and he chastised Ms Harris for failing to take questions from reporters since ascending to the top of the ticket. Much of the event, though, was spent on Trump's old favourites, as if he was reaching for his rally hits. He talked about poll numbers, the unfair media, the dire state of the country and, yes, crowd sizes (even comparing his crowds to those of the civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King, Jr) Historically, one way Trump gets attention is by saying things that are controversial. And there was some of that today, too. He suggested America was on the brink of a world war and said Jewish Americans who support Vice-President Harris need ""to have your head examined"". This attention deficit is an unusual position for Trump. The former president is not used to having to fight for the limelight, particularly in this election cycle. The Biden campaign was happy to let Trump dominate the news, in the belief that the more the race was about the former president, the better it would be for the current one. The Biden team wanted Trump front and centre. But the shake up on the Democratic side has been dramatic and newsworthy and has pushed Trump off the front pages. To make things harder for the Republican candidate, much of the coverage of Ms Harris's unexpected roll out as Democratic candidate has been positive. So, the strategy by Democrats has flipped. Right now, Democrats are enjoying the media attention. Ms Harris wants this race to be about her. And with all the Democratic political drama, the press has been happy to oblige. Hence the Mar-a-Lago news conference that didn't really have much news. Trump may do better following the advice of Marc Lotter, the Republican strategist who ran communication strategy for his 2020 campaign, who texted me to say the way the former president should win back attention was to stay focused.  ""Define Harris and Walz on policy,"" he said. ""He wins on policy and results."" To be fair, there was some of that in this press event. Trump repeatedly described Ms Harris as ""extreme"" and ""liberal"". He did tout his own record on the economy and the border.  But the attacks got rather lost in his grievance about crowd sizes and how they are reported, and even suggested that there may be something unconstitutional about the Harris campaign. And, then it was over. And, as if to prove a point, within minutes of Trump walking off stage, the fickle cable news cameras had shifted their lenses from Florida to  Michigan where Ms Harris and Mr Walz were holding a meeting with union workers. It was the Democrats time for some press coverage. Once again. North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

1234,What does science tell us about boxing’s gender row?,"Images of the Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting on the medal podium in Paris will go down as some of the most unforgettable of the 2024 Olympics. A frenzied debate has raged over the International Olympic Committee clearing the duo to compete in the women's boxing in Paris, despite them having been disqualified from last year's Women's World Championships for failing to meet eligibility criteria. Amid the heat, science is shedding increasing light on our different chromosomal make-ups and what advantages they may bring to sport. But the research is ongoing and even among the experts who spend their professional lives working on it, there are differing interpretations on what the science tells us. We do know that the process of sex determination starts when a foetus is developing. Most females get two X chromosomes (XX), while most males get an X and a Y chromosome (XY). Chromosomes influence a person's sex.  But hormones are important too, before birth - as well as later on during puberty. While the baby is still growing in the womb, hormones help the reproductive organs develop. However, at some point through the pregnancy some babies’ reproductive organs don’t develop in the way most people's do. This can be caused by conditions called DSDs: differences in sex development. Listen to Sofia read this article There are a group of about 40 conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs that develop in the womb. It means a person's sex development is different from that of most other people's. These chromosome abnormalities are rare - but they have come into sharp focus because of the boxing row at the Olympics. Both fighters were said to have failed International Boxing Association gender eligibility tests last year – but there has been conflicting information whether XY chromosomes or elevated testosterone were found. While representatives of the fighters and the IOC insist the fighters were “born women, raised as women and always competed as women”, critics, including some of their opponents at Paris 2024, have speculated that perhaps the fighters have DSD. Because these genetic variations are so many and so varied, some experts say it’s impossible to establish that everyone with a Y chromosome is a male and everyone without a Y chromosome is a female. “Just looking at the presence of a Y chromosome on its own does not answer the question of whether someone is male or female,” says Prof Alun Williams, who researches genetic factors related to sport performance at the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport. “It’s obviously a very good marker, as most people with a Y chromosome are male…but it’s not a perfect indicator.” For some people with DSD, the Y chromosome is not a fully formed typical male Y chromosome. It may have some genetic material missing, damaged or swapped with the X chromosome, depending on the variation. When it comes to being male or female, what is usually crucial is a specific gene called SRY - which stands for ‘sex-determining region of the Y chromosome’. “This is what is called the make-male gene. It’s the master switch of sex development,” says Dr Emma Hilton, a developmental biologist who studies genetic disorders. She is also a trustee of the Sex Matters charity, which argues Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting shouldn’t be competing until further testing is done. There are some people born with XY chromosomes who have lost what Dr Hilton calls the ""make-male"" gene. “These people don’t make testosterone. They develop a very typical female anatomy,” Dr Hilton says. So a test that identifies XY chromosomes does not offer a complete picture. And in the case of Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, the IBA has not disclosed details of the way they were tested. However, Dr Hilton also says that in most people with DSD who have XY chromosomes, the SRY ""make-male"" gene is present. These people usually have testicles which are often inside the body. “When they hit puberty they start producing testosterone - which is what underpins male advantage in sports,"" says Dr Hilton. The most famous example is Caster Semenya - a double Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion over 800m, though Prof Alun Williams says there is not direct evidence that DSD athletes have the same advantage as typical males. The roadblock is in a gene required to generate external genitalia - which boys need in order to grow a penis. Anyone with the same condition as Caster Semenya has a mutation within that gene that stops it functioning normally. In the womb, they will develop a male anatomy until the final stage of growing a penis - and when they are not able to, then they’ll start developing a vulva and a clitoris. But they don’t develop female reproductive organs: they don’t have a cervix or a uterus. These people don’t have periods and they can’t get pregnant. Having sex with males can be difficult. Discovering you have this kind of genetic mutation can be a shock. “The most recent woman we diagnosed with having XY chromosomes was 33,”  says Claus Højbjerg Gravholt - an endocrinology professor at Aarhus University who spent the past 30 years dealing with DSD. His patient came to see him because she had no idea why she couldn’t get pregnant. “We discovered she didn’t have a uterus, so she would never be able to have a baby. She was absolutely devastated.” Prof Gravholt says the implications that come with questioning one’s gender identity can be destabilising - and he often refers his patients to a psychologist. “If I showed you her photo, you would say: that’s a woman. She has a female body, she is married to a man. She feels like a female. And that is the case for most of my patients.” When Prof Gravholt asked her why she didn’t consult a doctor about not getting periods, she said there was another older woman in her family who never menstruated - so she thought it wasn’t abnormal. There is another genetic mutation Prof Gravholt has come across. He has diagnosed males who have XX chromosomes - which are normally found in females. “These men are infertile. They look like normal males, but their testes are smaller than average and don’t produce sperm. It’s always devastating when they find out. As they grow older, they stop producing testosterone in the way most men do.” In some cultures, talking openly about periods and female anatomy is not culturally acceptable. In some parts of the world, women may lack the education to understand that there’s something atypical going on in their bodies. And that’s why experts believe that many DSDs are never diagnosed - which means that comprehensive data is scarce. But Prof Gravholt points to figures from Denmark as a good indicator. “Denmark is probably the best country in the world at collecting this data - we have a national registry with everyone who has ever had a chromosome examination.” He says that XY chromosomes in females are very rare - in Denmark it’s about one in 15,000. But he believes that when adding these many genetic conditions together, about one in 300 people are affected. “We are learning that these variations are more common than we thought,” Prof Gravholt says. “A lot of patients are being diagnosed later in life. The oldest person I diagnosed was a male in his 60s.” Do people with differences of sex development have an unfair advantage in sport? The short answer is that there is not enough data to reach a definitive conclusion. “It wouldn’t surprise me if some people with a type of DSD had some physical advantage over women,” says Prof Alun Williams. Those advantages could include larger muscle mass, as well as bigger and longer bones and larger organs such as lungs and heart. He says they may also have higher levels of blood haemoglobin that lead to improved oxygen delivery to where it’s needed in working muscles. ""Some people with some types of DSDs might have advantages in some or all of those elements, ranging from 0-100%, depending on the type of DSD and its precise genetic cause."" He believes his opinion is representative of the experts in his field, but that more evidence is needed. When it comes to Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, we don’t have enough information to know if they have a DSD that would need to be regulated. Regulating elite sports, which typically rely on male-female binary categories in competition, is complicated because the biology of sex itself is complex. Dr Shane Heffernan has a PhD in molecular genetics in elite sports and is currently working on a paper on what athletes think about competitors with a DSD. He says it’s all about the nuance of the individual’s genetic condition. For example, females with a DSD known as androgen insensitivity syndrome have XY chromosomes; they produce testosterone; but their bodies aren’t equipped to process it. So they don’t get any of the benefits from that testosterone, like males do. Dr Heffernan says that there aren’t enough known and studied athletes with a DSD to make a valid scientific conclusion as to whether they definitely have an advantage, and as to whether they should be eligible or ineligible to compete in the female category. He believes that the International Olympic Committee is not basing its eligibility criteria on the best available science. “This is worrying. The IOC makes an 'assumption of no advantage' - but there is no direct evidence for this, nor that there is a performance advantage with DSD athletes solely because of their genetic variations. “We simply don’t have enough data. Many people hold an emotional position when it comes to inclusion in the female category, but how can the IOC justify this position - without the data to support it?” He is one of many people who are urging the Olympics committee, international federations and funding councils to invest in research on athletes with a DSD - but he appreciates it’s difficult, because there can be a lot of stigma towards the individual athletes when it comes to these conditions. Some are calling for mandatory sex testing at the next Olympics - including Reem Alsalem, the UN’s special rapporteur on violence against women and girls. “Screening DNA is now a piece of cake,” Dr Emma Hilton says. “A simple cheek swab would be sufficient, and it’s minimally invasive.” She says swabs should happen when athletes first register for their first affiliated competition - before they start winning medals and the spotlight hits them, so as to avoid what happened with Imane Khelif. But there’s disagreement on that among scientists. “A cheek swab wouldn’t allow you to reach a robust conclusion on someone’s sex and potential advantage in sport,” says Prof Williams. He argues a comprehensive sex test would have to include these three categories: 1. Genetics (including looking for a Y chromosome and the SRY ""make-male"" gene). 2. Hormones (including, but not limited to, testosterone). 3. The body’s responsiveness to hormones like testosterone. Some people might have a Y chromosome, but be completely insensitive to testosterone. He believes this is currently not being done because it’s expensive, it requires people with very specific expertise - and there are ethical concerns about the testing procedure. “This assessment can be humiliating. It includes measurements of the most intimate parts of anatomy, like the size of your breast and your clitoris, the depth of your voice, the extent of your body hair.” One thing is certain: this controversy is not going away.  For now, science is not yet able to offer a definitive view on how people with differing chromosomal make-ups should be categorised for the purposes of elite sport. For those who spend their lives trying to make sense of the science, their hope is that this latest row will propel much-needed research.

1238,Johnson-Thompson ends Olympic medal wait with silver,"This video can not be played Watch all of Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon events Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson ended her long wait for an Olympic heptathlon medal but narrowly missed out on gold to history-maker Nafissatou Thiam in a dramatic concluding 800m in Paris. Two-time world champion Johnson-Thompson set up a captivating finale by ensuring Belgium's Thiam remained within 121 points - equating to roughly 8.5 seconds - before the decisive seventh event at the end of the two-day competition. Johnson-Thompson, with a superior lifetime best by six seconds, opened a significant lead on Thiam and crossed the line in a personal best two minutes 4.90 seconds. It was a gutsy performance from the Englishwoman, but Thiam followed her home with about two seconds to spare to win by 36 points and become the first woman to win three heptathlon titles. Johnson-Thompson put together a superb competition at her fourth Games, recording the second best points total of an illustrious career which has delivered two global triumphs. This emotional silver, no matter how close to gold, is one to be celebrated and savoured for Johnson-Thompson - her arduous pursuit of a first Olympic medal now complete after numerous setbacks. Having earned the opportunity to chase the sport's ultimate prize over two laps, three years after injury heartbreak in Tokyo, Johnson-Thompson gave everything in the 800m run of her life. But it was Thiam - the heptathlon great of her generation - who added Paris gold to Olympic triumphs in Rio and Tokyo by finishing in 2:10.62. “I can’t even describe the words that this week has taken. I’m just so relieved,” Johnson-Thompson told BBC Sport. “I’m just so, so happy that I've got an Olympic medal to add to my collection.” Thiam finished on 6,880 points - ahead of Johnson-Thompson on 6,844. Thiam's compatriot Noor Vidts moved above Switzerland's Annik Kaelin in the final event to take bronze. Team GB's Jade O'Dowda finished 10th overall, while Ireland's Kate O'Connor was 14th. This video can not be played Johnson-Thompson runs PB in heptathlon 800m As Johnson-Thompson crouched on the track, eyes fixed on the big screen which seemed to take an age to display the full results, she wore a look of acceptance - aware she had not quite been able to produce the sensational finish required for gold. But when Thiam's sixth-place finish flashed up, confirming the 29-year-old had done enough, it did not take long for Johnson-Thompson's expression to change. A beaming smile spread as a lifelong dream at last came true, Johnson-Thompson donning a silver tiara and waving her nation's flag proudly above her head. She had gritted her teeth through the final metres of the race, the lactic building with every stride, years of hurt channelled into every stride. The gap would grow - just not enough. Johnson-Thompson was always going to finish ahead of Thiam, but the margin required for victory seemed unlikely against a competitor of her opponent's stature and experience. Thiam became the youngest Olympic heptathlon gold medallist in history with her first triumph aged 21 and has now won 10 of the 11 international titles she has contested since that breakout triumph. The one exception? Silver as Johnson-Thompson won the 2019 world title. Johnson-Thompson has had to overcome a career-threatening Achilles rupture and a devastating mid-competition injury at the Tokyo Olympics, but in Thiam's absence she returned to the top of the world last year to complete a remarkable turnaround in her career. Fit and firing once again in Paris, she pushed Thiam all the way to have a chance of gold, and Olympic silver after world gold represents a fitting reward for her perseverance. “I wanted to compete and I wanted to be able to respond. I knew coming into the champs I was in good shape - physically, mentally, emotionally,” Johnson-Thompson said. “Today I proved to myself that I can have that competitive energy. Those third time jumps, third time throws and clearances. I’m just so happy with how everything went, I've got no complaints.” This video can not be played 'I'm so relieved' - Johnson-Thompson reacts to winning her first Olympic medal Thiam prevailed despite bettering Johnson-Thompson in only three of the seven events. The three-time European champion excels in the throwing events and topped the standings in both the shot put and javelin - crucially outperforming Johnson-Thompson by 166 points in the latter. Johnson-Thompson said her magnificent shot put personal best on Thursday was ""probably the best thing I've ever done in my career"" as she limited her expected losses, and a season's-best javelin performance kept her in contention after the penultimate on Friday morning. It was in the 200m and long jump events where Johnson-Thompson will recognise missed opportunities to make greater gains. Describing her 23.44 200m as frustrating, she still gained 98 points on Thiam to take the overnight lead. Thiam leapt one centimetre further in the long jump on Friday morning as Johnson-Thompson landed a conservative second attempt after miscuing on her first, improving to 6.40m on her third despite a post-injury best 20cm further. Those twists and turns left Johnson-Thompson facing a tall task - too tall, ultimately - in the finale. However, in the context of her wider journey to this point, to get that close and achieve a first Olympic medal all the same, meant the moment was no less meaningful.

1249,'Glad I didn't give up' - Johnson-Thompson's Olympic silver joy,"This video can not be played 'I'm so relieved' - Johnson-Thompson reacts to winning her first Olympic medal Four Olympic Games have brought four very different experiences for Katarina Johnson-Thompson. It has been a rollercoaster journey through a career marked by stunning highs and desperate lows. From the top of the world to fearing it might all be over, and back again. Each experience led Johnson-Thompson to this moment at Paris 2024 - when silver felt almost as good as gold. With a podium place on the sport's biggest stage at last in reach, the 31-year-old arrived at the decisive 800m race of her fourth Games with the chance of becoming champion. The near-certain guarantee of a medal represented - beyond any doubt - an exceptional achievement in itself, four years after a career-threatening Achilles injury and three years after being dealt another devastating injury setback in Tokyo. Faced with the task of needing to finish 8.5 seconds ahead of arguably the greatest heptathlete of all-time, Johnson-Thompson produced a fearless performance to clock a personal best before facing an agonising wait for the official results. Deep down, she already knew as she crouched on the track at the Stade de France. It was confirmed that Nafissatou Thiam had crossed the line with two seconds to spare, winning by only 36 points to become the first woman to win three Olympic heptathlon titles. In truth, though, it didn't really matter at all. It was silver for Johnson-Thompson, who said earlier this year ""it's really hard to be a fan of me"". The magnitude of her emotional podium finish will not be lost on those who have followed the ups and downs of her career since London 2012. ""I can't even describe the words that this week has taken,"" Johnson-Thompson told BBC Sport. ""I'm just so, so happy that I've got an Olympic medal to add to my collection. ""It has been so hard getting back to this point so I'm just so relieved."" Johnson-Thompson ends Olympic medal wait with silver GB win women's 4x100m relay silver and men take bronze This video can not be played Watch all of Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon events Above the three-inch scar on Johnson-Thompson's left Achilles tendon is a tattoo of a blue shell, used in the game Mario Kart to wipe out the race leader. Johnson-Thompson had at last fulfilled her world-beating potential to become world champion in Doha in 2019, beating reigning Olympic champion Thiam by a sensational 304 points and breaking Jessica Ennis-Hill's British record. A year later, it all came crashing down. An Achilles rupture on her take-off leg, so crucial to the jumping capabilities which allowed her to achieve her maiden global triumph, saw Johnson-Thompson start the Olympic year wearing a protective boot. Remarkably, she recovered in just eight months to make the Tokyo Olympics, only to suffer further heartbreak. In a soulless stadium absent of spectators amid the global pandemic, a calf tear sustained during the 200m left her writhing on the track in pain, bringing the cruellest end to her latest bid for an Olympic medal. Emblematic of the resilience she has shown throughout, she picked herself up and carried on, hobbling across the finish line, but the significant blow ultimately led to a year of indifference and underperformance in 2022. Repeated setbacks left her disheartened. Almost a bystander at the World Championships, she finished a disappointing eighth and later admitted: ""Eugene was the worst of me. It was such a horrible experience."" It took gold in front of a home crowd at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham later that summer to reignite her desire to fight for titles, putting her on the path that would eventually lead to the moment she had long dreamed of in Paris. Denise Lewis, Olympic heptathlon champion at Sydney 2000, said on BBC TV: ""She has worked doggedly to be the best that she can be. ""Her demeanour has changed. She is more confident. She is resilient, absolutely resilient. ""She is the national record holder, a double world champion. Had she not left this arena with a medal she would have been really disappointed. It completes the set."" Only in winning world gold in 2019 has Katarina Johnson-Thompson performed better than at Paris 2024 Johnson-Thompson described her second global heptathlon triumph in Budapest last year as ""the best day of my life"" after she defended a narrow lead over favourite Anna Hall to complete a remarkable turnaround in her career. With expectations raised, it was time for redemption on the sport's biggest stage. London 2012 represented a learning experience for the teenage Johnson-Thompson, who finished 13th as Ennis-Hill won gold on an unforgettable Super Saturday for Team GB, but it was sixth place in Rio that she felt marked a missed opportunity. It even caused her to question whether she wanted to continue - long before the unfortunate events of Tokyo. ""Rio 2016 was mental exhaustion. Tokyo 2020 was physical exhaustion,"" Johnson-Thompson said. ""After both of those Olympics, I wanted to give up for different reasons, but I'm glad I didn't. ""I'm so happy with the last three years and the team around me. I wouldn't be on the start line without them."" Speaking on BBC TV, Ennis-Hill said of Johnson-Thompson: ""I remember in Rio after we competed, she was almost ready to stop there. She had just had enough. ""But she kept going for two more Olympics. It's so hard to put into words how challenging that is and how well she has done."" In Paris, those 12 years of global championship experience were channelled into putting the record straight. Johnson-Thompson produced a personal best in the shot put, by far one of her weakest disciplines, to remain in gold medal contention, before running the 800m of her life as she amassed the second-best score of her career in pursuit of the ultimate prize. Wearing a beaming smile, a silver tiara on her head and with a Union Jack draped over her shoulders, the achievement of going so close to gold at all was not lost on her for a second as Thiam's victory was confirmed. Even this year there had been concern surrounding preparations after Johnson-Thompson withdrew from the European Championships in June with a minor leg issue, having contested only three events but already fallen behind Thiam. That was a necessary sacrifice to make as she went after the one prize she desperately desired. ""I'm very grateful and emotional. I'm feeling overwhelmed. I've got no regrets,"" Johnson-Thompson said on Friday evening. ""I'm just trying to take it all in and live in the moment. It's the ultimate relief. ""I was running for gold, but to be honest I had such mixed emotions that I was sort of grieving gold but also fighting for gold. Then I was celebrating silver. So many mixed emotions. ""Just to be on the podium is such an honour. Olympic cycles can be brutal, and I know that more than anyone.""

1250,Egypt wrestler arrested in Paris for sexual assault,"Egypt wrestler Mohamed Ibrahim won bronze at Tokyo 2020 Egyptian Olympic wrestler Mohamed 'Kesho' Ibrahim has been arrested in Paris for an alleged sexual assault. The Paris prosecutor's office released a statement saying: ""On August 9 around 5am, a man born in March 1998 in Egypt who was a wrestler in the Olympic delegation was arrested in front of the Oz cafe."" It is understood he was arrested for allegedly touching the buttocks of another customer at the cafe. The Egyptian Olympic Committee (EOC) named Kesho, who won a bronze medal at the Tokyo 2020 Games, as the team member who had been arrested. The EOC added he will be investigated by its ethics committee and could face a life ban from competition. ""If the allegations are substantiated, the wrestler will face permanent suspension and will be barred from participating in both domestic and international competitions,"" it said. Kesho was beaten by Azerbaijan's Hasrat Jafarov in the first round of the men's 67kg Greco-Roman wrestling on Wednesday. The EOC said he had been given permission to leave the Egyptian camp to watch the final of his weight category but failed to return and turned off his phone.

1247,Netherlands secure historic Olympic hockey double,"This video can not be played Netherlands win women's hockey gold The Netherlands overcame an almighty scare to retain their Olympic title in the women's hockey by beating China on penalties in the final. The Dutch were the overwhelming favourites having thrashed China 3-0 in the group stages, but were nine minutes away from missing out on gold before Yibbi Jansen equalised with a drag flick. The match finished 1-1, and the current world and European champions dominated the shootout with Dutch keeper Anne Veenendaal making three saves in a 3-1 win. It means the Netherlands have now won four of the past five Olympic titles - the one exception being a silver medal in 2016 - and the Dutch became the first nation  to win two hockey golds at the same Games after the men's team won their final on penalties on Thursday. China, who matched their best hockey finish at a Games when they lost to the Dutch at Beijing 2008, opened the scoring in the first quarter when Chen Yi deflected in Dan Wen's pass across goal. The Dutch had also hit the post in the second quarter through Frederique Malta's drag flick. In the bronze medal match, Argentina defeated Belgium 3-1 on penalties after the game finished 2-2 after 60 minutes. Sofia Cairo scored the winning penalty against a Belgium side who were playing in only their second Olympics, as goalkeeper Cristina Cosentino saved three shootout attempts. Belgium took the lead early on through Emma Puvrez before Agustina Gorzelany equalised seven minutes into the second quarter. Argentina went ahead through Agustina Albertarrio, before Belgium's Justine Rasir levelled the scores and her side defended resolutely for the rest of the game.

1248,Spain edge France in extra-time thriller to win football gold,"This video can not be played Spain win Olympic gold after eight-goal thriller in final against France Spain continued their recent dominance of international football by edging past France - who fought back from 3-1 down to force extra time - to win Olympic men's gold at Paris 2024. The hosts took an early lead but in a pulsating match they quickly fell two goals behind before half-time, then mounted a stunning second-half comeback. However, Thierry Henry's side could not see the job through as Spain substitute Sergio Camello kept calm in the most tense of situations to score twice in the extra period. Both goals sparked jubilant celebrations among the Spanish, who mobbed Rayo Vallecano forward Camello as they won Olympic gold for the first time since 1992. The thrilling triumph continued Spain's success, little over a month after they won the men's European Championship, beating England in the final. They also won the men's under-19 European title last month, while the women's team lifted the World Cup last year. In contrast, the mood of the hosts was initially one of deflation before a more celebratory tone as the squad received their silver medals. ""It wasn't easy to build this team up, but I'm proud of the work we did,"" said Henry. With France unable to clinch victory, Great Britain remained fifth in the Paris 2024 medal table. Both nations have won 14 gold medals but Team GB have 57 overall which is one more than France. Why Spain's teams are dominating football  Spain have won Olympic men's football gold for the first time since 1992 Henry is a national hero for his playing exploits, having helped France win the 1998 World Cup on home soil before going on to become their all-time record goalscorer. Leading Les Bleus to a first Olympic gold in 40 years would have further immortalised the 46-year-old among his compatriots. In front of a passionate 48,000 crowd at the Parc des Princes, France made an encouraging start when Enzo Millot's shot squirmed through weak hands from Spain keeper Arnau Tenas. But Spain's attacking quality quickly clicked into gear to stun the host nation. Within seven minutes, they had equalised when Barcelona's 21-year-old Fermin Lopez finished off an incisive move with a first-time shot which he scuffed but spun into the bottom corner. Spain were slick, sharp and got their rewards again to take the lead. Fermin notched his second when he was more alert than the French defenders, gambling when Guillaume Restes went to gather a left-wing cross and then pouncing when it did not stick to the French keeper's gloves. When Alex Baena casually and precisely clipped in a free-kick for the third, it looked ominous for France. However, Henry's side rallied in dramatic fashion and retained belief with their stirring second-half display. The evolving emotions of the home crowd - from excitement through joy, despair, and anger - had turned to hope. France pulled a goal back when Maghnes Akliouche diverted in Michael Olise's inswinging free-kick, continuing the surge of momentum and confidence. With time running out, though, more drama produced a gripping finale. A melee in the box led to referee Ramon Abatti being told to go to the pitchside monitor and, after a moment of theatrical tension, pointed to the penalty spot with Benat Turrientes deemed to have been holding France substitute Arnaud Kalimuendo. Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta held his nerve to convert with a composed finish in stoppage time, sparking more wild celebrations among the home fans who collectively caught their breath before extra time started. Spain, though, looked they still had the capability to carve open France with their slick passing - and that's what happened as Camello turned an incredible game back in their favour with his double strike. ""There were a few minutes during the first half in which we disappeared,"" added Henry. ""And we paid a high price for that.""",2024-08-09 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/live/ce800785073t,Jonathan Jurejko,Unknown,,True
1253,Celine Dion 'does not endorse' Trump  use of Titanic song,"Celine Dion's team has criticised former US President Donald Trump for the ""unauthorised"" use of a clip of one of her hits at a presidential campaign event. The song My Heart Will Go On - which featured in a 1997 film about the doomed ship Titanic -  was played to supporters before Trump appeared on stage at a rally in Bozeman, Montana, on Friday.  In a statement released on X, Dion's team said she did not ""endorse"" the use of the song, adding: ""And really, that song?"" Artists and bands including Neil Young, Queen and the Rolling Stones have previously complained about Mr Trump using their songs at campaign rallies. The statement said: ""Today, Celine Dion's management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc, became aware of the unauthorised usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing My Heart Will Go On at a Donald Trump / JD Vance campaign rally in Montana. ""In no way is this use authorised, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use. ""...And really, that song?"" The Trump campaign has not responded to the statement.  My Heart Will Go On is one of five-time Grammy winner Dion's best-known songs. The Oscar-winning ballad was on the soundtrack of the 1997 blockbuster Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as two lovers who meet on the doomed ship's maiden voyage in 1912. Dion made a triumphant return to live singing last month at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. It was her first performance since revealing she had been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) in 2022. SPS is a rare neurological disorder that causes muscles to spasm and can be debilitating. The singer discussed her struggles with SPS in a film called I Am: Celine Dion, which Amazon Prime Video said last month had become its most successful documentary ever. The Canadian artist Neil Young has also previously objected to Trump using his songs, and in 2020 the Rolling Stones threatened him with legal action after the song You Can't Always Get What You Want was played at a political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne sent a notice to Trump banning him from using Black Sabbath music in campaign videos in 2019.  The Republican Party's presidential candidate is not the only politician to receive criticism from artists over the use of songs during campaign rallies.  Last year, rapper Eminem asked aspiring Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to stop using his songs. Bruce Springsteen castigated President Reagan for planning to use Born in the USA for his 1984 election campaign. Fatboy Slim furiously denounced the UK Labour Party for using his hit Right Here, Right Now at their 2004 conference - the year after the Iraq War.  Legally, US politicians do not always need direct permission from artists.  Their campaigns can buy licensing packages from music rights organisations giving them legal access to more than 20 million songs. However, artists have the right to remove their music from that list. ",2024-08-10 23:09:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xlj48pl42o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1254,Hayes leads US to Olympic gold in her first tournament,"This video can not be played Watch highlights as Emma Hayes leads US to Olympic gold beating Brazil in first competition  Emma Hayes underlined her status as one of the best coaches in the women's game by leading the United States to Olympic football gold in her first tournament in charge. The 47-year-old Englishwoman only took over little under three months ago, but has transformed a transitional US team into Olympic champions. Mallory Swanson's composed second-half finish was enough to secure the Americans' first Olympic gold since 2012 - and fifth overall. An entertaining encounter at a sweltering Parc des Princes had not produced the goal that it deserved until Swanson beat the off-side trap and coolly slotted beneath Brazil keeper Lorena. Brazil almost snatched an equaliser early in the 10 minutes of injury time when Adriana saw her diving header clawed away by US keeper Alyssa Naeher. But they were unable to create any more opportunities as their wait for a first international women's title goes on. Hayes took over the United States after leaving Chelsea, where she won 14 trophies in her 12-year tenure, in May When Hayes received a call about the US job, she described how she was left ""stunned for a couple of days"" at the prospect of taking over one of the most iconic roles in women's football. Sure the aura of the world's once-dominant team had faded in recent years, but the lustre of restoring glory to the powerhouse of the game remained. Hayes, who left Chelsea as their most-decorated head coach after winning 14 trophies in a sensational 12-year tenure, warned the revival would take time. Last year, the US recorded their worst performance at a Women's World Cup when they were knocked out by Sweden in the last 16. Slipping to fifth in the world rankings was an unwanted nadir. But Hayes has already managed to build a style of play, added to a team spirit underpinned by her British humour,, external which has proved successful. After weathering some early Brazil pressure, including Ludmila seeing a goal ruled out for a tight off-side, the Americans grew into a game which flowed from end to end. Swanson was unable to take their best chance of the first half, but made amends after the break to become the golden match-winner on her 100th cap. Hayes instantly hugged her coaching staff at the final whistle as the rest of the bench raced onto the pitch with Bruce Springsteen classic 'Born in the USA' blaring out. Marta is the all-time leading scorer in World Cups, men's or women's, with 17 goals in 23 appearances across six tournaments As well as offering the shot at an historic international title, Brazil's run to the final also provided an opportunity for the iconic Marta to bow out on the biggest stage. One of the greatest players which the women’s game has ever seen, Marta has won a vast array of team and individual honours – but will retire without the international trophy which she craved. Marta, 38, left the pitch in tears when she was shown a straight red card in the group game against Spain. Her team-mates reaching the final, though, allowed the chance of redemption, although the  six-time Fifa world player of the year had to settle for a place on the bench. Marta, part of the Brazil team which won Olympic silver at Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008, was introduced moments after the US took the lead. With half an hour to make an impact, she struggled to find space and did not have any clear-cut opportunities from open play. Her best effort came in the final five minutes of normal time when she bent a 20-yard free-kick over the bar. Time ran out for the Brazilians - and the clock ticked down on Marta’s international career.  As the forward walked off the pitch, Brazil coach Arthur Elias stalled Marta to ensure she was the last player off and the focal point of a heartfelt standing ovation from both Brazil and US fans.

1256,Trump campaign says its internal messages hacked by Iran,"Donald Trump’s campaign has said some of its internal communications have been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives. US news website Politico reported on Saturday that it had been emailed campaign documents including internal research carried out on Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election,” a campaign spokesman told the BBC. Politico said it had confirmed the authenticity of the documents. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. The campaign did not give any further details or any evidence linking the document leak to Iranian hackers or the Iranian government. Its statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June. Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear phishing email – a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link. “Over the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,” the MTAC report said. Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung said the June hacking attempt mentioned in the MTAC report “coincides with the close timing of President Trump’s selection of a vice presidential nominee"". “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,” Mr Cheung said. Politico said that in late July it began receiving emails from a person who identified themselves only as “Robert” using an AOL email account. The news outlet said the Vance file was 271 pages long and based on publicly available information about Vance’s past record and statements. The email account also sent part of a research document about Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also a vice presidential contender, it said. Presidential campaigns routinely research potential vice-presidential nominees in order to ferret out any potentially embarrassing revelations. Politico reported that some of Mr Vance's previous - and well-known - criticisms of Trump were labelled in the document as ""potential vulnerabilities"".  The Microsoft report noted: ""Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles."" Microsoft had released a similar report during the 2020 election saying Iranian hackers had targeted presidential campaigns.  US security sources have also warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month’s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president. The BBC has contacted Iranian officials for comment.",2024-08-10 23:09:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge30ze4dpo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1264,Criticism of Australian Olympic breaker 'disappointing',"This video can not be played Australia's 'Raygun' competes in breaking at Paris 2024 Australian Olympic great Anna Meares says the social media mocking of a breaker for her routine and choice of clothing is ""really disappointing"". Rachael Gunn, 36, failed to win over the judges as she lost her three round-robin contests in the competitive form of breakdancing by an aggregate score of 54-0 on Friday. The university lecturer - who competes under the name Raygun - wore a green and yellow Australian Olympic tracksuit, while her rivals were kitted out in streetwear as breaking made its debut as a Games event. As well as criticising her attire, social media users mocked the Australian's routine as she bounced around on stage like a kangaroo and stood on her head at times. Explaining her performance, Gunn said: ""I was never going to beat these girls on what they do best, the dynamic and the power moves, so I wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative because how many chances do you get in a lifetime to do that on an international stage? ""I was always the underdog and wanted to make my mark in a different way."" Meares, a two-time Olympic cycling gold medallist who is the Australia team's chef de mission in Paris, said of the criticism: ""I think that what has occurred on social media with trolls and keyboard warriors, and taking those comments and giving them air time, has been really disappointing."" Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Meares said: ""I absolutely love her courage. I love her character, and I feel very disappointed for her that she has come under the attack that she has."" Breaking: The new Olympic sport for 2024 explained Breaking makes head-spinning Olympic debut Responding to the backlash on social media, Gunn said: ""Don't be afraid to be different, go out there and represent yourself, you never where that's gonna take you."" Meares says the criticism of Gunn was evidence of misogyny. ""In 2008, she was locked in a room crying being involved in a male-dominated sport as the only woman, and it took great courage for her to continue on and fight for her opportunity to participate in a sport that she loved,"" Meares said. Gunn appeared to agree with Meares' sentiment, as she questioned whether male counterparts would be met with the same level of outrage for their clothing choices. ""Looking forward to the same level of scrutiny on what the b-boys wear tomorrow,"" Gunn said on Friday. In breaking, female participants are known as 'b-girls', while males are referred to as 'b-boys'. Breaking - a style of street dance that originated in 1970s New York - was announced in 2020 as part of the Olympic programme for Paris. The event, which has been introduced to attract a younger audience to the Games, is not yet part of the programme for Los Angeles in 2028.

A serial winner in club management, the 47-year-old maintained her golden touch in her first act on the international stage as Mallory Swanson's composed second-half finish helped the Americans win the gold medal for the first time since 2012.  It ensured there would be no fairytale ending for Marta. An icon of the women’s game and six-time world player of the year, she heads into retirement at the end of her sixth and final Olympics, aged 38, with a third silver medal. The US have been crowned champions five times since women's football was introduced to the Olympic programme in 1996. American dominance also extends unsurprisingly to the basketball court, where they have now won every single men's competition they have entered, aside from in 1972, 1988 and 2004. A star-studded side containing LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant proved too strong for a French squad that included NBA rookie of the year Victor Wembanyama. Leading 49-41 at half-time the US eventually sealed a 98-87 win, with Curry contributing 24 points.

However, Shortman and Thorpe's Olympic success had been in the making for a while after they became the first Britons to win a duet medal at the World Championships earlier this year - where they took a silver and bronze. The pair were fractionally outside the podium positions after Friday's technical routine although a score of 264.0282 was less than a point off the Netherlands, who held third place overnight.

And as they celebrated at the Stade de France, their third-place run was matched by Victoria Ohuruogu, Laviai Nielsen, Nicole Yeargin and Amber Anning, who clocked a British women's national record of 3:19.72 as the USA again took gold, this time ahead of a Netherlands team anchored by the fast-finishing Femke Bol. It marked a fifth relay podium result for GB, who also won a silver in the women’s 4x100m and men’s 4x100m bronze on Friday, following mixed 4x400m bronze last week. That success was a huge factor in the team reaching 10 athletics medals - their highest at an Olympics for 40 years, since 16 were won by GB athletes at Los Angeles 1984.

1263,Chiles could lose Olympic bronze in score dispute,"Chiles was initially in fifth place before her score was upgraded American gymnast Jordan Chiles could be stripped of the bronze medal she won in the women's floor final after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). It upheld a complaint by the Romanian Olympic Committee that an inquiry submitted by the US team about Chiles' score fell outside the one-minute limit for such appeals and should be disregarded. Chiles initially scored 13.666 in Monday's final, putting her in fifth place in the competition, and leading Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu, who scored 13.7, to believe she had won the bronze medal. However, after the inquiry by Chiles' coach Cecile Landi with regard to her difficulty rating, officials upgraded Chiles' score to 13.766, placing her third. The adjustment left Barbosu, who had begun celebrating her medal, upset and led to a protest from the Romanian team. In reinstating Chiles' score to 13.666, Cas said in a statement it was up to the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) to ""determine the ranking of the final of the women's floor exercise and assign the medal(s) in accordance with the above decision"".

1261,US superstars beat France to win Olympic gold,"Steph Curry scored 24 points as he led the way again for the United States  The United States maintained their grip on the Olympic men's basketball title by overwhelming hosts France to win a fifth successive gold medal in Paris. A star-studded American team packed with NBA icons, led by LeBron James and Steph Curry, demonstrated their quality to win 98-87 amid a febrile atmosphere at Bercy Arena. The success saw the current crop emulate the 1992 'Dream Team' which they have been regularly compared to. In front of almost 20,000 boisterous fans, France refused to roll over and moved back within three points at 82-79 with the clock ticking down in the final quarter. But Curry, as he so regularly does, instantly landed a three-pointer for 85-79 to ease the pressure and swished three more as the Americans raced away. Ultimately, Les Bleus did not have enough to put the Americans into an unwanted bracket of failure. Pretty much every US Olympic squad since the Barcelona Games has been compared to the side led by Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. Six teams have won Olympic gold - but none have ever come close to being revered like this Gen Z ensemble cast. Now, after securing victory in Paris, a group featuring four NBA regular season MVP winners - James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid - 11 NBA All-Stars and seven NBA champions has to be mentioned in the same breath. Curry was the focal point of the American celebrations when the final hooter went, hugged by his team-mates and draped in a Stars and Stripes flag by James. On the penultimate night of the Games, it was the Bercy Arena which felt like the hottest ticket in town. France, led by NBA rookie of the year Victor Wembanyama, against the American All Stars. The magnitude of the occasion was indicated by the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron and calibre of athletes - past and present - courtside. The hosts were represented by football icon Thierry Henry and NBA legend Tony Parker, along with swimmer Leon Marchand and judoka Teddy Riner. On the American side of celeb row was sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson, television personality Jimmy Fallon and Scottie Pippen, part of the legendary 1992 roster which the current crop were trying to emulate. Not everyone was so lucky, however. Fans without tickets waited outside holding homemade signs pleading for someone to help them out. If those outside did manage to join the 16,000 other fans inside, it was well worth the gamble. Scottie Pippen sat next to fellow basketball legend Sue Bird and former United States footballer Megan Rapinoe The high-octane atmosphere in the stands continued on the court as the stars came out to play. France began well with their talisman Wembanyama - the 7ft 2in prodigy - scoring seven points in a fast and furious start. But the Americans quickly raised their level and responded strongly. James illustrated their growing confidence with a behind-the-back assist which Devin Booker put away before a pair of three-pointers from Anthony Edwards secured a 20-15 advantage at the end of the first quarter. France rallied at the start of the second period to turn a five-point deficit into a lead, but Team USA stepped on the gas. A six-point gap opened up at 37-31 when James trampled through French defenders in trademark fashion, with Curry and Jrue Holiday landing from behind the arc to put them eight points ahead at half-time. The hosts had an uphill task in front of them to dethrone the kings of the Olympic court. Continued to be backed by vociferous support, they kept plugging away to stay within reach. The third quarter closed at 72-66 and, although they refused to give up in the final period, their wait for a maiden Olympic title goes on.

1262,Taiwan's Lin follows Khelif by winning gold amid controversy,"This video can not be played Lin Yu-ting beats Poland's Julia Szeremeta to win women's featherweight gold An emotional Lin Yu-ting became the second boxer in 24 hours to win women's Olympic gold despite the ongoing row over her gender eligibility. The Taiwanese beat Polish 20-year-old Julia Szeremeta by unanimous decision to claim the featherweight title, a day after Imane Khelif became the welterweight champion. Lin and Khelif have been allowed to compete in Paris despite being disqualified from last year’s World Championships after reportedly failing gender eligibility tests. It was her fourth victory by unanimous decision from four in the competition after the 28-year-old, once again, dominated. Lin entered the ring to loud cheers once again and there was no sign of protest from Szeremeta, as has come from some of Lin’s previous opponents. Lin and Szeremeta shared an embrace after the result was confirmed. The Taiwanese was then visibly emotional during the medal ceremony and afterwards was embraced by bronze medallist Esra Yildiz Kahraman. After defeat by Lin on Thursday, Turkey's Kahraman made an 'X' gesture to the crowd - said to be intended to represent female chromosomes - but both were smiling after their hug on the medal podium. Lin’s victory signalled the end of one of the most controversial stories at this Olympics but the debate is likely to continue, and could even impact whether boxing is part of the next Olympics in Los Angeles. Hours before Lin's fight, a French lawyer had said he is representing Khelif in a legal complaint in France for online harassment over the issue. Nabil Boudi said Khelif has decided to ""begin a new fight, a fight for justice, dignity and honour"". He said she has filed the complaint for ""aggravated online harassment"". Asked if she would take similar action, Lin said: ""This is something I will discuss with my team. I will decide later what will be the next step."" Lin said she ""shut herself off"" from social media during the competition to avoid the controversy. ""Some of the noises and news articles... of course I heard some of the information through my coach, but I didn’t pay too much mind to it,"" she said. ""I was invited by the IOC to take part in the Games, this is what I focused on."" Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? What does science tell us about boxing’s gender row? Lin has won each of her fights by a 5-0 scoreline  Lin and Khelif were banned last year by the International Boxing Association (IBA) who said the pair ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". But the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which runs the boxing events at the Olympics, allowed them to compete, insisting Khelif and Lin were ""born and raised as women"", and has strongly has criticised the IBA. The IOC had previously suspended the Russia-led organisation over concerns around governance and regulation and has raised doubts about the tests. The row erupted after Khelif’s first bout in which Italian Angela Carini abandoned after 46 seconds, saying afterwards she had to “preserve” her life. As Lin and Khelif progressed with comfortable victories in the ring, a chaotic news conference held by the IBA last week did little to clear the confusion around their bans. Chief executive Chris Roberts said the pair had ""chromosome tests"", while president Umar Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests determined the fighters' testosterone levels. The IOC, which has run the boxing events at the Olympics since suspending the IBA, said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female and has backed the pair throughout. There has been apparent criticism from Lin and Khelif’s fellow competitors, however. Like Kahraman, Bulgaria’s Svetlana Staneva made an 'X' gesture in the ring after defeat although Yang Liu, who Khelif beat on Friday night to secure her victory, raised the Algerian’s arm in celebration after the bell. Lin and Szeremeta’s bout seemed to be fought in good spirits. The Pole, a surprise silver medallist who continued her unusual technique of keeping her hands low but was picked off by two-time world champion Lin, made a heart shape with her hands in the direction of the crowd before leaving the ring. Elsewhere on the final night, Uzbekistan won two more golds to take their total in boxing to five. Bakhodir Jalolov successfully defended his super-heavyweight title by beating Spain’s Ayoub Ghadfa. Abdumalik Khalokov won the men’s featherweight title by beating Munarbek Seiitbek Uulu of Kazakhstan. And China’s Li Qian beat Panama’s Atheyna Bylon to take the women’s middleweight crown. Team GB medics save Uzbekistan boxing coach's life Today's Olympics guide In 2021 the IOC issued new guidance for women’s sport which placed the responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport. Since then many sports have banned transgender women from taking part in women's events, such as athletics, aquatics and both rugby codes. Athletics has also brought in specific rules around athletes with differences of sex development (DSD). Were a body to come in and take over the running of amateur boxing from the IOC it could implement its own rules on eligibility. Bach left the door open to revisiting the IOC’s own eligibility rules when he spoke to the media on Friday. “If someone is presenting us a scientifically solid system how to identify men and women, we are the first ones to do it,” he said. “We do not like this uncertainty, we do not like it for the overall situation, we would be more than pleased to look into it.” The controversy has overshadowed much of the boxing in Paris, doing little to help the uncertain future around the sport’s place at the Olympics. The sport has been part of every Olympics since 1920 but there have been doubts around whether it would remain part of the programme for the Los Angeles Games in 2028. “The IOC will not organise boxing in LA without a reliable partner,” Bach said.",2024-08-10 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c1w7q075pw0o,Unknown,2024-08-10 23:09:46,,True
1269,Bach to step down as Olympic chief next year,"Bach is a former Olympic fencing champion International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach says he intends to stand down after the end of his second term next year. The German lawyer, who has been in charge since 2013, surprised members at a session during the Paris Games, saying he would not continue despite being asked to. An extension would have required a change in the Olympic charter that limits the president to a maximum of 12 years - a first eight-year term and a second four-year term, that he himself had helped draft. ""After 12 years in the office of IOC president our organisation is best served with a change in leadership. New times are calling for new leaders,"" he said in an emotional speech. The new IOC president will be elected in March 2025 at a session in ancient Olympia and will take over in June of that year, Bach said. No member has yet openly campaigned to succeed him. An Olympic fencing champion in 1976 who joined the Olympic body as a member in 1991, Bach has ruled firmly since taking over from his predecessor Jacques Rogge 11 years ago. He introduced sweeping reforms for the faster introduction of sports onto the Olympic programme, and to the bidding process and staging of the Games, reducing overall costs and making the event more attractive to potential candidate cities.

1270,The hockey legend who stood tall in cricket-mad India,"The moment India won a bronze medal in hockey at Paris Olympics, the players burst into wild celebrations. But PR Sreejesh quietly walked to one end of the field and bowed down in front of the goalpost - his home for almost two decades. He will miss that home, but India will miss him even more. The goalkeeper, who played his last international match on Thursday, leaves an illustrious legacy behind him. The “Wall of India”, as he is popularly known, played a crucial role in India’s podium finish. His team were up 2-1 and Spain were fighting hard for an equaliser but Sreejesh thwarted their attempts, especially in the dying minutes of the match. The instincts and the tactful dives he is known for were on full display. His impact on the game can be understood from the fact that the Spaniards earned nine penalty corners,  but couldn’t convert any. Sreejesh and his defence team put their bodies on the line to protect their lead until the end.  The former Indian captain can also be credited with bringing India into contention for a medal. The knock-out match against Great Britain went into a penalty shootout and once again it was down to the Wall to protect his team - he did exactly that with two masterful saves. He was in tears after India lost the semi-final to Germany as he knew the elusive gold medal was out of his grasp, but he quickly turned his attention to the bronze medal match. On Thursday, he was crying again – but this time in joy. Indians cried with him and social media was flooded with tributes to the man who carried the country's hopes and dreams for nearly two decades. India is known to be cricket crazy and players from other sports often don’t get the same attention, fame or money. And for a hockey goalkeeper, it’s even harder to be acknowledged. “It’s difficult to love a goalkeeper. He is invisible, and is only in the limelight when he makes a blunder. When I was young, I didn’t know who India’s goalkeeper was then,” he told the Indian Express in 2021. Sreejesh never chased attention or stardom; he just liked to get on with the job. It was this attitude that kept him going despite a bitter-sweet debut. He had already made waves in the junior circuit with his quick reflexes and ability to judge a ball’s trajectory in nano seconds. But his debut in the senior team in 2006 at the South Asian Games didn’t go that well. He performed well in the tournament but missed a crucial save in the final against India's arch-rival Pakistan. The criticism that followed was a steep learning curve for him. The next few years were tough as he didn’t get a permanent place in the team. Indian hockey also went through a bad phase during this period, with the team failing to even qualify for the Beijing Olympics in 2008. But Sreejesh continued to work hard on his skills and his moment of redemption came in 2011. It was the final of the Champions Trophy and Pakistan was once again the opposing side. He looked much more self-assured and made two crucial penalty saves to win the game for India. Sreejesh was thrust into the limelight immediately after the match. He travelled with the team to the London Olympics in 2012 but India ended their campaign without a medal. Despite the team’s dismal performance, the custodian of the Indian goalpost continued to perform well. His next shining moment came when he was again faced with Pakistan in the 2014 Asian Games final. He saved two penalties to end India’s 16-year gold medal drought at the Games. But if there is one moment that sums up his character, grit and determination, it has to be the bronze medal match against Holland in the Hockey World League in 2015. He was badly injured, his thighs were covered in ice packs, his thumb was close to broken and his shoulder was covered in protective surgical tapes. He could barely walk the night before the match. He joked that he looked  like a mummy as he took his position at the goalpost. But behind all the pain and the humour was a resolve to win a medal for India in a major international tournament after more than three decades. His stunning saves in the penalty shootout helped India win the match against a superior team. His place as a legend in Indian hockey was now cemented. He was soon asked to lead the team at the Rio Olympics. They didn’t win a medal but reached the quarter-final - bettering their performance from London. But he never let success get to his head, remaining humble and approachable and living his life without the trappings of glamour usually associated with sport stars. This endeared him to his teammates and also Indians at large. An injury in 2017 threatened to end his career. Defying all odds, he made a comeback after two surgeries and several months of rehabilitation. But his performance took time to peak and critics said his famed reflexes had slowed down. Younger goalkeepers were also making a claim for his spot. But he stayed away from the noise and continued to work hard. He was once again ready to end another drought - a 41-year wait for a hockey medal at the Olympics. He helped India win a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with his astute understanding of the game. He was able to ride through many storms in his career largely due to his upbringing.  Sreejesh was born into a farming family in the southern state of Kerala. He loved sports but didn’t enjoy running as much. So after trying out other sports and different playing positions in hockey, he chose goalkeeping as it didn’t involve much running. He did well at the state level and was called for the national trials in Delhi in 2003.  The 15-year-old arrived in the Indian capital after a train journey of more than 48 hours. He spoke little Hindi – the language spoken by most players at the camp. Staying with mostly Hindi-speaking boys in the hostel, he embraced the challenge and learnt the language – including some pretty colourful words that were often heard during tense matches in later years. He was selected for the team but didn't have a good kit to protect himself. His father then sold his cow to raise 10,000 rupees ($119; £93) to pay for the kit. Life came full circle on Thursday when his father was surrounded by hundreds of people in his house to watch his son win yet another accolade for India in his last match. For Sreejesh, his two children will now become his priority, along with his new role as the head coach of the Indian junior hockey team.  “It's time for my kids to start their journey and I'm done, and their life starts,” he told Olympics.com. When asked about his legacy, he prefers not to talk about his achievements. “I want people to remember me as a good person who always had a smiling face,"" the Hindustan Times quoted him.  ""And for the youngsters and kids, when they pad up and step on to the hockey field, they should feel I want to become a keeper like Sreejesh.""",2024-08-10 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje20v4xlzpo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1271,Five crazy weeks as an Olympic chauffeur,"Taxi drivers are often hoping to pick up a five star review, but Olympic chauffeur Elisabeth Lomholdt is hoping she gets a chance to pick up real life stars. The volunteer driver from Denmark is spending the summer behind the wheel, zig-zagging between venues across Paris.  So far she hasn't seen a medallist, instead taking officials to and from the Games but says she's had no shortage of interesting conversations. ""The longer the ride, the better,"" the 25-year-old tells BBC Newsbeat. ""I feel so inspired after hearing people's stories."" Elisabeth, who lives in Copenhagen, says: ""Every time I have passengers, I have one question, because I'm really interested in learning what the biggest sports are from their country. ""Because in Denmark, it's mostly soccer and handball and in all other countries, those are not the main sports."" Elisabeth has been living in Paris for five weeks and says when she first arrived, ""a lot of people told me, 'you're crazy that you want to drive in Paris'."" Traffic in the French capital can be notoriously difficult to navigate. ""When you drive in Paris, people, mostly the motorcycles, put on the light and just go beep, beep, beep, and they just continue in between cars,"" says Elisabeth. ""What I'm used to is like roundabouts with lanes, stuff like that. Here, there are no lanes. ""You just have to kind of adapt."" Lots of people volunteer straight after graduating but Elisabeth might have the best stories. She loves sport, but more than that she says she was drawn to the opportunity to see behind the scenes at such an enormous event when she first applied more than a year-and-a-half ago. ""It's not what you see on televisions, it's all that, all the things that are in the back,"" she says. ""Like, how is it structured? I think that's really interesting."" Elisabeth is one of 45,000 people volunteering at the Paris Olympics out of more than 300,000 who applied. ""It's really inspiring how our help is such a big part of the Olympics,"" she says.  ""The Olympics wouldn't be the Olympics without volunteers."" Paris 2024 pledged to be the most sustainable Games yet.  That's why TikTok has been full of videos of athletes bouncing on cardboard beds and vegan options in the canteen. Organisers also made plans when it came to getting around the city, making all the venues accessible by public transport and creating 400km (250 miles) of new bike lanes. Elisabeth's taxi has had a sustainable makeover. The car she drives is part of an electric fleet and fewer vehicles have been commissioned overall than in previous Games. The 25-year-old hopes to see more people inspired to volunteer their time. ""I know we don't get paid, but it gives you so much more than what money is,"" she says.  ""It gives you perspectives on life."" And with the closing ceremony on Sunday, Elisabeth still has a chance to pick up her dream passengers. ""I think it would be fun to have some of the Danish athletes,"" she says.  ""But I am biased.""

1272,Trump doubles down on scary helicopter trip story,"Donald Trump continues to insist that he once took a scary helicopter trip with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, even as Mr Brown dismissed the story as ""fiction"". But it turns out another California politician, Nate Holden, did accompany Trump  decades ago on a turbulent chopper ride, US media report. Both Mr Brown and Mr Holden are black.  The former president said during a news conference  that he and Mr Brown had gone ""down"" in a helicopter together and Mr Brown had been ""a little concerned"". The story  became an issue after Trump recounted it on Thursday, in response to a question about Mr Brown's relationship with Kamala Harris. The pair dated in the 1990s. Trump was asked whether he thought the relationship had played a role in Ms Harris's career journey. At the time, Ms Harris was a prosecutor and in 2002 was elected district attorney in San Francisco. ""Well, I know Willie Brown very well,"" Trump said, before speaking about his memories of the flight. ""We thought maybe this was the end,"" Trump said. ""We were in a helicopter... and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing."" He then claimed the former mayor had told him ""terrible things"" about Ms Harris.  ""He had a big part in what happened with Kamala,"" Trump said.  Mr Brown, 90, told US media he had never shared a helicopter with Trump, adding: ""I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him.""  He also denied he said anything disparaging about Ms Harris. ""That's so far-fetched, it's unbelievable,"" he told local TV station KRON. ""I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way.  ""She's a good friend a long time ago, absolutely beautiful woman, smart as all hell, very successful, electorally speaking. ""He was doing what Donald does best, his creative fiction.""  Despite a flat denial from the former San Francisco mayor, Trump insisted the story was true in a call to the New York Times, saying he was “probably going to sue” without elaborating. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung posted a photo of a page of Trump's book ""Letters to Trump"" showing the former president pictured with Mr Brown and including a caption mentioning the helicopter incident. Meanwhile Mr Holden, 95, a former Los Angeles city councilman and state senator, told US media outlets he had a distinct recollection of a helicopter trip with Trump. In the 1990s, Trump was attempting to develop property in Los Angeles. Mr Holden said that they took a very turbulent helicopter ride around 1990, during a visit with Trump to his Atlantic City casino.  The helicopter experienced mechanical trouble and was forced to make an emergency landing in New Jersey. Others speculated that Trump, 78, may have confused Willie Brown with Jerry Brown, California's former governor, with whom he shared a helicopter in 2018 to visit the aftermath of the Paradise wildfires. Gavin Newsom, the current state governor, was also on the flight. But both men told US media there had been no emergency landing or danger on that flight. Trump's remarks at an hour-long news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate come as recent polls show him slipping against Ms Harris.  A survey conducted by the New York Times and Siena College from 5 to 9 August puts Ms Harris ahead of Trump by 50% to 46% in three key battleground states - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The RealClearPolitics polling average gives Ms Harris a slight edge in the popular vote, although Mr Trump retains a lead in a number of the most important swing states.",2024-08-10 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c985enjgdy9o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1277,Rapper Travis Scott released without charge in Paris,"Rapper Travis Scott has been released from custody in Paris without charge, French authorities have said, after fighting with his bodyguard. The 33-year-old US star was alleged to have attacked a security guard who attempted to break up the two men at the five-star George V hotel on Friday morning. Mr Scott was held in custody for 36 hours before being released by police.  French prosecutors confirmed he had been let go and the case had been dropped because the offence had been ""insufficiently established"". On Thursday evening, Mr Scott, real name Jacques Bermon Webster, was photographed at Team USA's Olympic basketball match against Serbia. He was pictured next to American businessman Michael Rubin and fellow rapper Quavo, former frontman of hip-hop group Migos. Earlier this year, Mr Scott was arrested in Miami in relation to an argument on a private yacht. Showbiz news site TMZ has reported that prosecutors dropped a charge of disorderly intoxication against him, but he still faces a count of trespassing. Mr Scott is a 10-time Grammy Award nominee and one of the biggest hip-hop acts in the world. He was previously in a relationship with Kylie Jenner and the pair have two children together. In 2021, 10 fans died in a crowd surge at his Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas. He did not face criminal charges over their deaths, but remains involved in civil cases alleging that organisers were at fault.

1278,Trolling of viral Olympics breaker 'disappointing',"This video can not be played Australia's 'Raygun' competes in breaking at Paris 2024 Australian Olympic great Anna Meares says the social media mocking of a breaker for her routine and choice of clothing is ""really disappointing"". Rachael Gunn, 36, failed to win over the judges as she lost her three round-robin contests in the competitive form of breakdancing by an aggregate score of 54-0 on Friday. The university lecturer - who competes under the name Raygun - wore a green and yellow Australian Olympic tracksuit, while her rivals were kitted out in streetwear as breaking made its debut as a Games event. As well as criticising her attire, social media users mocked the Australian's routine as she bounced around on stage like a kangaroo and stood on her head at times. Explaining her performance, Gunn said: ""I was never going to beat these girls on what they do best, the dynamic and the power moves, so I wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative because how many chances do you get in a lifetime to do that on an international stage? ""I was always the underdog and wanted to make my mark in a different way."" Meares, a two-time Olympic cycling gold medallist who is the Australia team's chef de mission in Paris, said of the criticism: ""I think that what has occurred on social media with trolls and keyboard warriors, and taking those comments and giving them air time, has been really disappointing."" Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Meares said: ""I absolutely love her courage. I love her character, and I feel very disappointed for her that she has come under the attack that she has."" Breaking: The new Olympic sport for 2024 explained Breaking makes head-spinning Olympic debut Responding to the backlash on social media, Gunn said: ""Don't be afraid to be different, go out there and represent yourself, you never where that's gonna take you."" Meares says the criticism of Gunn was evidence of misogyny. ""In 2008, she was locked in a room crying being involved in a male-dominated sport as the only woman, and it took great courage for her to continue on and fight for her opportunity to participate in a sport that she loved,"" Meares said. Gunn appeared to agree with Meares' sentiment, as she questioned whether male counterparts would be met with the same level of outrage for their clothing choices. ""Looking forward to the same level of scrutiny on what the b-boys wear tomorrow,"" Gunn said on Friday. In breaking, female participants are known as 'b-girls', while males are referred to as 'b-boys'. Breaking - a style of street dance that originated in 1970s New York - was announced in 2020 as part of the Olympic programme for Paris.

1279,Williams takes bronze for second medal of Games,"This video can not be played Team GB's Noah Williams performs an impressive final dive scoring 94.35 Britain's Noah Williams pulled off a stunning final-round dive to take bronze in the men's 10m platform and win his second medal of the Paris Olympics. Errors by his rivals had opened up the podium positions going into the final round and Williams - who won 10m synchro silver with Tom Daley earlier in the Games - delivered a forward four and a half somersaults dive that scored 94.35 to give him a total of 497.35. Cao Yuan defended his title in convincing fashion (547.50) to give China a clean sweep of the diving gold medals, with Japanese 17-year-old Rikuto Tamai getting the silver (507.65).  ""It's literally a dream – I said that last time with synchro but individually winning a medal, doing it yourself, is a whole other level and I don't think it's sunk in because I'm nowhere near as emotional as last time,"" Williams told BBC Sport. Britain's Kyle Kothari finished 11th on his Games debut, above world champion Yang Hao who was out of sorts and came last in the 12-man final. Williams had only just squeezed into the final after a below-par showing in the semi-finals, so was the first to dive in each round. It meant he had a nervous wait after his brilliant final effort to see if it would be enough for a medal. But when challengers including Mexican Randal Willars Valdez put in messy dives, Williams soon discovered he would be adding to what was Great Britain's biggest diving medal haul at a Games. After four synchro medals, this is Britain's only individual diving medal. Noah Williams won his second medal of the Paris Games This is only the fourth time Great Britain have won a medal in this event. All of them have been bronze and two of them were for Daley - in 2012 and 2020. You have to go back to Brian Phelps in 1960 for the other. Daley was in the stands watching his synchro partner Williams in the final diving event of the Games. Williams has been happy in the past to stay in the shadow of Daley but with these medals he has announced himself firmly on the big stage. He joins Daley and Jack Laugher as the only British divers to win two medals in one Olympics - but is humble in that he does not see himself in the same league. ""I just got lucky,"" he said. ""They're a whole other level. Those two are the greatest of GB diving. Don't get me wrong, I'm so happy with how I've done and it's a huge achievement but they are another class."" It had looked like he was out of the running for his first global individual medal when he over-rotated on his fourth dive but consistency across his other dives, coupled with errors from others, kept him in touching distance before the stunning final effort. He said it had been an advantage to dive first, explaining: ""When you're first, I'm not focused on anyone else, I just literally did what I had to do to get the medal."" Williams' individual bronze brought Great Britain's diving medal total to five in Paris In terms of numbers of medals won, Paris has provided Great Britain with its biggest number ever, surpassing its previous best of three.  Before Williams' individual medal, the other four had come in the synchronised events, with Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen starting the medal rush on day one of the Games in the synchronised 3m springboard. Daley and Williams followed that with silver in the men's 10m synchro platform before Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson took Great Britain's first ever medal in the women's event with a bronze. Laugher and Anthony Harding then added a bronze in the men's synchronised 3m springboard as the nation won a medal in all four synchro events for the first time. Unlike at Tokyo 2020 and Rio 2016 there was to be no British diving gold as China stood on top of the podium in all eight events. But they made the finals in all the individual events to underline that British diving is in a strong place.

1280,Olympic gold 'greatest moment in my career' - Hayes,"This video can not be played 'Best moment in my career' says Hayes leading USA to gold after beating Brazil in final Emma Hayes said winning Olympic football gold with the United States was ""the greatest moment"" of her career. The 47-year-old led the USA to a 1-0 victory over Brazil and their first women's football gold since 2012. Victory at the Parc des Princes came just 84 days after Hayes won the Women's Super League title with Chelsea, the team she managed for 12 years, achieving great success. She had just four warm-up games in her new job to prepare for Paris 2024, with few talking about the USA as serious contenders for the gold medal. ""Chelsea has been my love,"" she said. ""Every trophy I won with that club is dear to me. ""But this professionally is probably much bigger than anything else I have ever done."" This video can not be played Watch highlights as Emma Hayes leads US to Olympic gold beating Brazil in first competiton The USA - who were World Cup winners in 2015 and 2019 - had suffered a dip in fortunes during recent years. At last year's World Cup, they suffered a shock early exit in the last 16 at the hands of Sweden and subsequently dropped to fifth in the Fifa rankings. When Hayes left Chelsea and ended a 12-year tenure in which she won 14 trophies, she told BBC Sport she was doing so to take on ""the biggest job in women's football"". She always believed this squad had the potential to win gold in Paris. ""I just woke that beast up again,"" Hayes said. ""I'm used to being in finals, I'm used to competing for trophies, and so is the US women's national team. The mentality is why I love the country, it's why I am made for it."" The USA have won Olympic football gold in 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2024 When the final whistle blew, Hayes was overcome with emotion as she embraced her staff on the touchline before jumping up and down in celebration with her players. Throughout the tournament, Hayes has often recalled watching the 2012 Olympic women's football final with her late father, Sid, who told her one day she would be the one leading the US to Olympic glory. ""It's been a rough year,"" Hayes said. ""This time last year my dad was dying. I didn't think I had the courage to come and do this. ""This team have embraced me and welcomed me into their family and allowed my to lead them."" Hayes was spotted on camera kissing her necklace and pointing to the sky at full-time in tribute to her father, who died last September. ""It's an American eagle and it's my father's,"" she said. ""I think it's so fitting my dad gave me his American eagle necklace. That was for my dad. ""I felt him with me the whole performance. I just had a moment to myself to remind myself of what I've been through in my life, my career, and to show gratitude to my parents - the people that matter the most.""

1281,Lin follows Khelif by winning gold amid controversy,"This video can not be played Lin Yu-ting beats Poland's Julia Szeremeta to win women's featherweight gold An emotional Lin Yu-ting became the second boxer in 24 hours to win women's Olympic gold despite the ongoing row over her gender eligibility. The Taiwanese beat Polish 20-year-old Julia Szeremeta by unanimous decision to claim the featherweight title, a day after Imane Khelif became the welterweight champion. Lin and Khelif have been allowed to compete in Paris despite being disqualified from last year’s World Championships after reportedly failing gender eligibility tests. It was her fourth victory by unanimous decision from four in the competition after the 28-year-old, once again, dominated. Lin entered the ring to loud cheers once again and there was no sign of protest from Szeremeta, as has come from some of Lin’s previous opponents. Lin and Szeremeta shared an embrace after the result was confirmed. The Taiwanese was then visibly emotional during the medal ceremony and afterwards was embraced by bronze medallist Esra Yildiz Kahraman. After defeat by Lin on Thursday, Turkey's Kahraman made an 'X' gesture to the crowd - said to be intended to represent female chromosomes - but both were smiling after their hug on the medal podium. Lin’s victory signalled the end of one of the most controversial stories at this Olympics but the debate is likely to continue, and could even impact whether boxing is part of the next Olympics in Los Angeles. Hours before Lin's fight, a French lawyer had said he is representing Khelif in a legal complaint in France for online harassment over the issue. Nabil Boudi said Khelif has decided to ""begin a new fight, a fight for justice, dignity and honour"". He said she has filed the complaint for ""aggravated online harassment"". Asked if she would take similar action, Lin said: ""This is something I will discuss with my team. I will decide later what will be the next step."" Lin said she ""shut herself off"" from social media during the competition to avoid the controversy. ""Some of the noises and news articles... of course I heard some of the information through my coach, but I didn’t pay too much mind to it,"" she said. ""I was invited by the IOC to take part in the Games, this is what I focused on."" Boxing's gender row - what's going on and are Russia involved? What does science tell us about boxing’s gender row? Lin has won each of her fights by a 5-0 scoreline  Lin and Khelif were banned last year by the International Boxing Association (IBA) who said the pair ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". But the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which runs the boxing events at the Olympics, allowed them to compete, insisting Khelif and Lin were ""born and raised as women"", and has strongly has criticised the IBA. The IOC had previously suspended the Russia-led organisation over concerns around governance and regulation and has raised doubts about the tests. The row erupted after Khelif’s first bout in which Italian Angela Carini abandoned after 46 seconds, saying afterwards she had to “preserve” her life. As Lin and Khelif progressed with comfortable victories in the ring, a chaotic news conference held by the IBA last week did little to clear the confusion around their bans. Chief executive Chris Roberts said the pair had ""chromosome tests"", while president Umar Kremlev appeared to suggest the tests determined the fighters' testosterone levels. The IOC, which has run the boxing events at the Olympics since suspending the IBA, said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female and has backed the pair throughout. There has been apparent criticism from Lin and Khelif’s fellow competitors, however. Like Kahraman, Bulgaria’s Svetlana Staneva made an 'X' gesture in the ring after defeat although Yang Liu, who Khelif beat on Friday night to secure her victory, raised the Algerian’s arm in celebration after the bell. Lin and Szeremeta’s bout seemed to be fought in good spirits. The Pole, a surprise silver medallist who continued her unusual technique of keeping her hands low but was picked off by two-time world champion Lin, made a heart shape with her hands in the direction of the crowd before leaving the ring. Elsewhere on the final night, Uzbekistan won two more golds to take their total in boxing to five. Bakhodir Jalolov successfully defended his super-heavyweight title by beating Spain’s Ayoub Ghadfa. Abdumalik Khalokov won the men’s featherweight title by beating Munarbek Seiitbek Uulu of Kazakhstan. And China’s Li Qian beat Panama’s Atheyna Bylon to take the women’s middleweight crown. Team GB medics save Uzbekistan boxing coach's life Today's Olympics guide In 2021 the IOC issued new guidance for women’s sport which placed the responsibility on individual federations to determine eligibility criteria in their sport. Since then many sports have banned transgender women from taking part in women's events, such as athletics, aquatics and both rugby codes. Athletics has also brought in specific rules around athletes with differences of sex development (DSD). Were a body to come in and take over the running of amateur boxing from the IOC it could implement its own rules on eligibility. Bach left the door open to revisiting the IOC’s own eligibility rules when he spoke to the media on Friday. “If someone is presenting us a scientifically solid system how to identify men and women, we are the first ones to do it,” he said. “We do not like this uncertainty, we do not like it for the overall situation, we would be more than pleased to look into it.” The controversy has overshadowed much of the boxing in Paris, doing little to help the uncertain future around the sport’s place at the Olympics. The sport has been part of every Olympics since 1920 but there have been doubts around whether it would remain part of the programme for the Los Angeles Games in 2028. “The IOC will not organise boxing in LA without a reliable partner,” Bach said.",2024-08-10 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c1w7q075pw0o,Unknown,2024-08-10 23:09:49,,True
1282,Brazil's 'queen' Marta unlikely to play for country again,"Marta has represented Brazil at six Olympics Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer Marta said she has likely played her last game for her country. The 38-year-old announced in April that she plans to retire from international football this year, but there had been speculation she might play on until the 2027 World Cup, hosted by Brazil. Orlando Pride forward Marta said Saturday's 1-0 defeat by the United States in the Paris 2024 gold medal match was her last ""in the Olympics and probably in official competition"". ""I don't think you will see me again at the World Cup,"" she added. Marta leaves with three Olympic silver medals after three defeats by the USA in 2004, 2008 and 2024. She has never won a major international trophy with Brazil, but goes down as ""the best in history"" according to Brazil boss Arthur Elias. ""We are all very proud of our national team and our number 10, our queen, Marta,"" he added. Marta is the all-time leading scorer in World Cups, men's or women's, with 17 goals in 23 appearances across six tournaments Marta's Olympics in Paris looked to have ended in bitter disappointment when she was sent off in tears for a dangerous tackle in a group-stage defeat by Spain. The straight red card came with a two-match ban, meaning Marta missed matches against France and Spain en route to Saturday's final. Though she was given the chance for a farewell appearance, Marta couldn't make an impact as a second-half substitute against Emma Hayes' USA. Elias said his embrace with Marta at the full-time whistle was a ""goodbye hug"", but she plans to stick around in some capacity. ""I am not going to disappear from football,"" she said. ""I am going to try to contribute somehow to this generation, because they are very talented girls and are well aware of what we can achieve. ""I have spent more than 20 years doing what I love most, and playing a sport that was not always seen as being for women. ""Now we can say that it is one of the most followed sports. Someone had to start that process, so I feel very proud to have contributed and participated in some way so that today people talk much more about women's football.""

Actor Tom Cruise descended from the roof of Stade de France to collect the Olympic flag as part of the handover to the American city of Los Angeles, which will host the next Games in 2028, before departing on a motorcycle. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre then performed on Venice Beach as part of a star-studded music set to conclude the ceremony. Earlier, inside the stadium in Paris, gold medallists Alex Yee and Bryony Page were Great Britain's flagbearers at the ceremony. Yee won the men's triathlon in dramatic fashion, while Page won Britain's first ever Olympic trampoline gold. Great Britain finished seventh in the medal table with 14 gold, 22 silver and 29 bronze. Their final tally of 65 medals was one more than the 64 they won at Tokyo 2020.

He added that they were ""Olympic Games of a new era"" as the first ""delivered completely under our Olympic agenda reforms: younger, more urban, more inclusive, more sustainable and the first Olympic Games with full gender parity"". The German praised athletes for their ""simply amazing"" performances, saying they showed ""what greatness we humans are capable of"". He continued: ""During all this time, you lived peacefully together under one roof in the Olympic Village. You embraced each other. You respected each other, even if your countries are divided by war and conflict. You created a culture of peace. ""This inspired all of us and billions of people around the globe. Thank you for making us dream. Thank you for making us believe in a better world for everyone. ""We know that the Olympic Games cannot create peace. But the Olympic Games can create a culture of peace that inspires the world. This is why I call on everyone who shares this Olympic spirit: let us live this culture of peace every single day.""

1286,Disney unveils new Lion King ride for Paris park,"A brand-new Lion King attraction is coming to Disney's resort in Paris, the entertainment giant has announced. Visitors will go ""on a journey through the African savanna"" alongside iconic characters from Mufasa and Simba to Timon and Pumbaa, theme park chief Josh D’Amaro said on Saturday. Mock-ups of the experience, presented to Disney fans at the D23 convention on Saturday, showed a log flume plummeting down Pride Rock as Rafiki the monkey watches on. The news comes just three days after Disney reported weaker-than-expected theme park results for the quarter that ended in June.  A Lion King experience has been rumoured for the Disneyland Paris resort in Marne-la-Vallée since 2022.  Disney announced last year that it planned to spend $60bn (£47bn) over the next decade to expand its theme park and cruise businesses, double the amount spent over the previous decade, prompting excitement from fans. Bosses have now confirmed that the Lion King-themed land will follow World of Frozen, a themed area based on the Frozen franchise that is due to launch in 2026 in Paris. The new areas are in the Walt Disney Studios Park, which will be renamed Disney Adventure World to signal its new offering. For the Lion King attraction, Disney's creative department - dubbed ""Imagineering"" - has promised to ""bring to life the majestic Pride Rock"". It will serve as ""the gateway to an adventure-filled water attraction that will plunge guests beneath the rock to follow Simba on his journey from cub to king"", the company said. Meanwhile, at Walt Disney World in Florida, the flagship Magic Kingdom park will undergo the largest expansion in its 53-year history, with one new land devoted to classic Disney villains and another area focused on Pixar's Cars movies.  At Disney's Hollywood Studios park, a long-rumoured Monsters Inc rollercoaster themed around the 2001 film's famous ""flying door"" scene was confirmed. And at Disney's Animal Kingdom park, more details for Encanto and Indiana Jones-themed rides were announced. On the US West Coast, the original Disneyland Resort in California will add two superhero-themed rides, a water-based Avatar attraction and the company’s first Coco ride. At Hong Kong Disneyland, a new Spiderman attraction will be opened as part of an immersive Marvel-themed area. Disney also announced four new cruise ships - on top of four others it had previously announced - almost trebling the size of its current fleet by 2031. ""Everything that we’re going to share with you tonight is in active development,"" Mr D'Amaro said on Saturday.  ""This means that plans are drawn. This means that dirt is moving. I just want to be clear with all the fans out there. This isn’t blue sky."" The weekend's flurry of announcements come after a rollercoaster ride behind the scenes at Disney in recent years. Chief executive Bob Iger dramatically returned to lead the company less than a year after retiring following a series of perceived missteps by his successor. Soon after his return Mr Iger announced a reorganisation and thousands of job cuts in a bid to improve the company's profits. Earlier this year, Disney won a boardroom battle against critics who accused the media giant of ""losing its creative spark"". Activist investors, including Nelson Peltz of Trian Management, had sought seats on the company's board of directors, which they said was too close to Disney's leadership. ""All we want is for Disney to get back to making great content and delighting consumers and for Disney to create sustainable long-term value for shareholders,"" Mr Peltz said at a shareholder meeting. Just 31% of votes cast supported Mr Peltz for a seat, according to a source familiar with the results. But the battle raised questions about struggles at Disney.  Last year, the company announced it was scrapping plans to build a new office campus in central Florida following a year-long dispute with Governor Ron DeSantis. Mr DeSantis attacked the company after it opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early years. Disney filed a First Amendment lawsuit against Mr DeSantis and other officials. The company had planned to build the campus around 20 miles (30km) from the giant Walt Disney World theme park resort and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California. Mr D'Amaro said in a memo to employees that ""new leadership and changing business conditions"" prompted the company to abandon those plans. This year, the runaway success of Disney's Inside Out 2 has helped boost the entertainment giant's profits. But operating profit declined 3% to $2.2bn (£1.7bn) with the company blaming a ""moderation of consumer demand"" that ""exceeded previous expectations"", along with higher operating costs.  The 2024 Olympic Games in Paris were partly blamed for the drop in its theme park takings, which make up over half Disney's profit.  However, its parks - among the most visited attractions in the world - have remained a reliable profit engine, helping cushion the impact of declines in traditional television and losses in Disney's video streaming business. The experiences unit, which includes parks, cruise ships and consumer products, contributed 60% of the company's operating profit in the most recent quarter - up from 30% just a decade ago. On Friday, details of new films including the title of the third instalment of Avatar, an addition to the Star Wars franchise and a sequel to Freaky Friday were announced at D23, held near Disneyland in Anaheim.",2024-08-11 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9dxkw70qqo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1295,Ten viral moments from the Paris Olympics,"This video can not be played Olympics 2024: Every Team GB Olympic medal in Paris Not all viral moments at an Olympics end in gold. With thousands in Paris and millions watching across the world, nothing is missed. Whether athletes or even spectators are trying or not, in today's world you can go viral in any given moment. From an unexpected swimmer at La Defense Arena to a casual Turkish shooter, this Games has had plenty of unique moments. Here is a look at the best of them. This video can not be played Iconic shorts man rescues swimming cap from Olympic pool Spectators at La Defense Arena saw some of the fittest athletes on the planet racing. Packed with up to 17,000 on the big nights, those swimmers had trained for years to deliver on the biggest stage. However, when a swimming cap was stuck at the bottom of the pool, they needed someone else to save the day. A middle-aged man was on hand, in some funky coloured trunks, to dive in and retrieve the hat, before raising his arm to receive a cheer from the crowd. You know you're cool when everyone copies you. Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, who won a silver medal in the mixed team 10m air pistol event, has been arguably the most popular character in Paris. The 51-year-old opted not to wear the high-tech gear of his shooting competitors, and held a nonchalant pose, with his non-shooting hand casually tucked into his pocket. That image spread quickly around social media, with Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis and Turkey midfielder Irfan Can Kahveci both copying the pose while celebrating. Storms raged inside me during viral image - Dikec Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen went viral for his review of the chocolate chip muffin from the Olympic Village. Christiansen, who posted food reviews from the village on his social media, rated the muffin, external an 11/10, calling the taste ""insane"". His online review gained the attention of other athletes, who proceeded to post their own review of the muffin. The 'muffin man' failed to reach the final of the 800m or 1500m freestyle events in the pool, and finished 25th in the 10km open water swim, but left with a new nickname. History was made in the women's floor final with the first all-black gymnastics podium ever in the Olympics. Brazil's Rebeca Andrade took gold ahead of United States pair Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles, who showed their class by bowing down on the podium to Andrade. Biles said it was ""just the right thing to do"" after she missed out on a fourth gold in Paris. The world's most decorated gymnast had a big smile on her face when bowing down to Andrade. Unfortunately for Chiles, she was later stripped of the bronze medal after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). Romania's Ana Barbosu was upgraded from fourth to third. Biles bows to 'queen' Andrade in iconic medal moment Team USA's Stephen Nedoroscik was waiting for his pommel horse routine, glasses on and in the zone. The Rubik's Cube-solving 'pommel horse guy' stared deep into the pommel horse, as he quietly waited his turn. Once the glasses came off, the 25-year-old turned into a pommel machine, and delivered a nerveless performances in both the team and individual events. Following his two bronze medals, his girlfriend changed her profile on X to 'Ms Pommel Horse'. His appearance has drawn comparisons to Clark Kent aka Superman, with Nedoroscik even using the United States flag as a cape in his celebrations. French pole vaulter Anthony Ammirati was denied an opportunity, in unique circumstances, to reach a home Olympic final. While qualifying rounds would not tend to make the headlines, a video emerged of Ammirati knocking off the bar via his crotch. That jump was not the reason he didn't qualify for the pole vault final, which many online felt was a more amusing story to tell. The 21-year-old saw the funny side and posted on social media: ""You create more buzz for your package than your performances."" This video can not be played Australia's Raygun competes in breaking at Paris 2024 Australia's Rachael Gunn failed to capture the imagination of the new global breakdancing audience. The 36-year-old university lecturer lost her three round-robin contest by an aggregate score of 54-0 on Friday. Her routine was mocked by social media users as she bounced around on stage like a kangaroo, rolled around on the floor, and stood on her head at times. She added that she ""wanted to move differently"". Trolling of viral Olympics breaker 'disappointing' A picture is worth a thousand words. French photographer Jerome Brouillet nailed this photo of Brazilian surfer Gabriel Medina, who won a bronze in the surfing. He may have jumped off the wave, but was it worth it for his social media account? Is this the photo of the Paris 2024 Olympics?  The 'why do athletes bite their medals' question might be one that China's Zhou Yaqin is asking. A video of the gymnast, who secured silver in the women's beam, saw her looking a tad confused when Italy's Alice D'Amato and Manila Esposito took a bite of their medals. Zhou followed suit, but only put the medal to her lips rather than sinking her teeth into her new silverware. Traditionally this was to check whether or not the gold was real, now it is photographers who ask the athletes to make sure the medal is real. American rapper and record producer Snoop Dogg was spotted at nearly every event in Paris. He was providing commentary for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and made sure to make himself known.

1296,Tom Cruise abseils off stadium roof in daring Olympic finale,"Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise made a dramatic appearance at Sunday night's Olympic closing ceremony in Paris, abseiling into the Stade de France from the roof.  The Mission: Impossible star descended into the stadium carrying the Olympic flag, as the the host city bid an emotional ""au revoir"" to the 2024 competition.   He was then seen in a pre-recorded film travelling through Paris and onto the US - where he journeyed to the legendary Hollywood sign and unfurled the Olympic colours.  Los Angeles is hosting the next Olympics in 2028, and the ceremony in Paris marked the formal handover.  Cruise was mobbed by athletes as soon as he landed in the stadium. He proceeded to take the flag from one of the stars of Paris - American gymnast Simone Biles - before a thrilled audience watched him zoom off on his motorbike.  The pre-recorded clip showing his journey to LA was soundtracked by California natives Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The funk-rock hitmakers then delivered a live performance of their classic track Can't Stop on a beach in Los Angeles. Other acts included Snoop Dogg, who performed with Dr Dre.  Cruise, also known for Top Gun, is renowned for performing his own stunts. Over the last decade or so, these have included scaling Dubai's Burj Khalifa and dangling on the outside of a plane as it took off, both for the Mission: Impossible series. Artistic director Thomas Jolly complemented Cruise's feat with another cinematic-feeling segment. A hushed, darkened stadium watched as a troupe of dancers rolled five giant rings across a stage, ultimately assembling the Olympic logo. The gloomy sci-fi aesthetic was finally punctured by an up-tempo performance from French band Phoenix, who tore into two hits. They were surrounded by athletes who climbed up on stage, to the consternation of the stadium announcer. Cruise's role was perhaps Paris's worst-kept secret. Rumours had been in the press for days - even before he was photographed in the stadium itself on Sunday evening. The 62-year-old was spotted several times in Paris during the Games fortnight, cheering on the US team in the swimming relay and watching multi-medal-winning American gymnast Simone Biles in action.  ""It's awesome,"" he told Reuters news agency at the time. ""Great stories, great athletes. It's incredible what they do."" Artistic director Jolly was also responsible for the Olympics' ambitious curtain-raiser last month. This featured a parade of boats along the River Seine and a comeback performance from singer Céline Dion.",2024-08-11 23:09:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d9ervrv5mo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1297,The best stats from the 2024 Games,"This video can not be played Olympics 2024: Every Team GB Olympic medal in Paris After 16 action-packed days, Paris 2024 has reached its conclusion. It has delivered sporting drama by the bucketload, the emergence of new heroes, world records have been broken and plenty of history written. So what are the stats to savour from this Olympic Games? BBC Sport takes a look... *The Netherlands were sixth with a total of 34 medals - 15 golds, seven silvers and 12 bronze The United States top the medal table for the seventh time in eight Olympic Games. At all eight, they have won the most overall medals. Great Britain matched their total number of medals from London 2012 as they passed the 60-medal mark for a fourth successive Olympics. Their tally of 65 was one better than Tokyo three years ago but it proved a Games of silver linings with just 14 golds collected, their lowest since Athens in 2004. Meanwhile, Japan followed on from their record-breaking success at their home Tokyo Games in which they won 27 golds, and excelled with another 20 golds, which is their second highest tally of all time. Their total was buoyed by their status as powerhouses in the wrestling, where they won eight golds at the Champ de Mars Arena. Australia's 18 golds also helped them to a fourth-placed finish as they beat their previous best total of 17 in Athens and Tokyo. This video can not be played McLaughlin-Levrone wins gold with new world record Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone smashed her own world record as she stormed to a sensational Olympic 400m hurdles gold in a time of 50.37 seconds, while her fellow Americans Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Kaylyn Brown and Bryce Deadmon set a new mark in the 4x400m mixed relay. Sweden's Armand Duplantis had already wrapped up the men's pole vault gold medal when he improved his world best of 6.24m, that he set in April, by one centimetre.  There were 31 world records broken overall, with the highest percentage (39%) arriving in the velodrome. Great Britain's Katy Marchant, Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane were responsible for three of those on the way to gold in the women's team sprint. That compares favourably to Tokyo where 22 world records went and is also slightly above the 27 that were eclipsed in Rio eight years ago. Reports have suggested the Olympic pool's relatively shallow depth of seven feet may have slowed down swimmers due to increased turbulence. Paris 2024 saw the emergence of a new swimming superstar as Leon Marchand became the first French athlete to take four individual golds at a single summer Olympics.   The 22-year-old hogged the headlines on home soil as he became only the third male swimmer ever to achieve the feat, after American greats Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz, and he added to his medal collection in the 4x100m medley relay with a bronze.  His five medals make him the joint most decorated athlete at the Games, along with fellow swimmers Mollie O'Callaghan from Australia and Torri Huske from the US. Away from the pool, Simone Biles was back to her brilliant best with A-listers Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman, Natalie Portman, Spike Lee, Tom Brady and Tom Cruise's presence underlining her status as the hottest ticket in town. Three triumphs - the all-around and vault titles, plus the team competition - took her career Olympic gold medal total to seven. The USA finished 47th when measuring medals by a size of population measure While the USA topped the official medals table, with population of just over 112,000, Grenada were actually the most successful nation when it comes to winning Olympics medals based on the size of their nation.  Anderson Peters and Lindon Victor's bronze medals in both the men's javelin and decathlon meant they averaged one medal per 56,289 inhabitants. Dominica, Saint Lucia and New Zealand, who averaged one medal per 266,945 of their population, make up the top four. Meanwhile Ireland were 18th, with Great Britain in 24th, the USA in 47th and China in 74th, while medal-starved India were bottom of the table averaging one medal per 234,151,666. India sent a contingent of 117 athletes to Paris, yet had a meagre haul of five bronze medals and a solitary silver to show for their efforts. They were also one of 28 teams that failed to win a gold in any sport. One of the big changes in the medal table was the absence of Russia, who have historically always been among the top four medal-winning countries and among the largest contingents. But the country was banned from these Games following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with its ally Belarus also barred. Instead, a handful of athletes from the countries (15 from Russia, 17 from Belarus) were invited to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) without national flags or anthems. They had to meet strict criteria over their eligibility - they had to pass background checks to make sure they did not actively support the war and were not contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies. Medals were won in five events by AINs but these are not being counted in the official medal table. Just one medal ceremony featured the specially composed anthem for AIN gold-medal winners. Belarusians won medals in two trampoline events (Ivan Litvinovich - men's gold, Viyaleta Bardzilouskaya - women's silver), one in rowing (Yauheni Zalaty - silver) and one in weightlifting (Yauheni Tsikhantsou - bronze). The only medal won by Russians was a silver for tennis players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the women's doubles. At all Olympic Games, medals are decided by the finest of margins. That has been particularly true in Paris with Noah Lyles claiming a stunning 100m gold by virtue of thrusting his torso out over the line first. However, in terms of winning margin (either in terms of times/points) that was not the smallest when worked out as a percentage of the winning time or points total. It wasn’t even the closest on the track, with the women’s 10,000m, won by Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet, closer at just 0.005% of the overall time. Great Britain’s photo-finish win over the Netherlands in the women’s quadruple sculls rowing was by a finer margin too, as were Adam Peaty and Matt Richards’ silvers in the pool. However, the closest of them all was the men’s horizontal bar gymnastics final, where Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka and Colombia’s Angel Barajas were barely inseparable. They both scored exactly 14.533 but the former won because of a higher execution score. This video can not be played Hodgkinson wins gold in women's 800m Keely Hodgkinson's superb 800m gold was one of the moments of the Games for Team GB, whose 10 medals on the track was their best tally at an Olympics since 1984 when they won 16 including golds for Sebastian Coe, Daley Thompson and Tessa Sanderson. Alex Yee produced a sensational sprint finish to top the podium in the men's triathlon and trampoline gold for Bryony Page crowned two decades of commitment to her craft, while Ellie Aldridge delivered an exhilarating kitesurfing success.  Lewis Richardson ensured the British boxing team did not walk away empty handed by earning a bronze after all five of his teammates were beaten in their first bouts. Tom Pidcock also defied a puncture to retain his Olympic mountain bike title as GB claimed medals in 19 different sports. Of Team GB's 14 gold medals, six each came in men's and women's events and two in mixed equestrian events, where male and female riders compete together - although the team jumping was won by an all-male trio of Scott Brash, Harry Charles and Ben Maher.",2024-08-11 23:09:38,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cy0rnpp14dvo,Unknown,2024-08-11 22:09:38,,True
1300,The Hollywood Olympics: All you need to know about Los Angeles 2028,"All the sporting action has now finished at the Olympics in Paris, and the famous five-ringed flag is being handed on to the 2028 host city, Los Angeles. US citizens who travelled to Paris for this year's Games told the BBC they have high hopes for 2028. LA resident Marisa was confident the event would be appropriately sprinkled with local “Hollywood glamour”. But she maintained Paris had set a very high bar. Fellow Americans who spoke to the BBC had concerns Los Angeles would not be able to match France's impressive public transport network. With the countdown to LA now under way, here is what we know so far about the next summer Games - which will also mark LA's first Paralympics. The Los Angeles Olympics opening ceremony will take place on 14 July 2028, with the closing ceremony just over two weeks later, on 30 July. The Paralympic opening ceremony will be on 15 August, and the closing event will be on 27 August.  In all, more than 50 Olympic and Paralympic sports will be contested across more than 800 events. The 2028 Games marks the third time LA has hosted the Olympics, and organisers - who have been eager to emphasise their sustainability credentials - have said no new, permanent constructions will be needed for the event. Instead, dozens of existing sites have been earmarked for use, including the home stadium of football team LA Galaxy and the LA Memorial Coliseum, which will host the athletics events as it did in LA's two previous Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly in a city that is famous for its palm-fringed shoreline, beach volleyball is expected to be hosted on an actual beach - something that was not possible in Paris this year.  But some venues will need to be adapted. For example, the SoFi Stadium, as it is currently known, in the suburb of Inglewood, will be converted to host the swimming races, with a resplendent Olympic pool added. Meanwhile, student housing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) will be turned into the athletes' village for the summer, and provide training facilities. From a sustainability perspective, it remains to be seen whether LA can pull off the ""car-free"" Games it pledged after winning the bid in 2017. Moving thousands of spectators across the sprawling Californian city poses a huge challenge for organisers - with current hopes for car-free transit pinned on a fleet of buses, after plans for a major rail network upgrade fizzled out, according to the Los Angeles Times. Nor will it come cheap.  The most recent budget forecasts expenditure of nearly $7bn (£5.5bn) on the Games themselves, in addition to any transport upgrades. In addition to the more familiar Olympic sports, the Los Angeles Games will see a revival of some disciplines not seen for a while, as well as some new additions.  Certain other Olympic sports that are relatively new to the line-up will continue, including surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing. But breaking, which debuted at the Paris Games, has not been picked as one of the disciplines - to the disappointment of some, given that this type of street dance was pioneered by the US. We can expect to see some of the biggest names from Paris 2024 in Los Angeles, too. Keely Hodgkinson stormed to gold in the women’s 800m in France. She will be 26 come the next Olympics – still in her athletics prime. One of the breakout stars from this year's Games has been swimmer Léon Marchand, cheered to four gold medals by the Parisian crowds with cries of ""allez!"" whenever his head emerged above water. Marchand, too, will be 26 in 2028, and looks likely to be in LA to fend off any challengers to his Olympic crown in the pool. The majority of contenders in this year's skateboarding event will remain in contention for 2028, particularly given the remarkable youth of the athletes in Paris, such as 11-year-old Zheng Haohao of China and Britain’s Sky Brown. Brown, twice an Olympic bronze medallist, will still only be 20 by the next Games – the question will be whether she skates, or qualifies for surfing next time. However, the participation of other global stars is less certain. Simone Biles, arguably the most recognisable name at Paris, will be 31. Few gymnasts continue competing into their 30s, but megastar Biles may fancy an Olympics in front of a home crowd, and a bid to add to her 11 medals. Newly-crowned men’s 100m champion Noah Lyles will also be 31 come LA 2028 - but should still be fit and well primed to emulate US compatriot Carl Lewis in his defence of that most celebrated of Olympic titles. But there may be a changing of the guard for Team GB. Swimmer Adam Peaty has hinted that Paris was his last Games, and diver Tom Daley only came out of retirement, to win silver in Paris, at his young son's request. However, GB rower Helen Glover has not ruled out a fourth Games and a bid for a fourth medal in LA – when she will be 42. During one lunch break, fans gathered at 3rd Base Sports Bar in Los Angeles to watch the US women's Olympic basketball team compete in Paris. Loud cheers erupted as soon as the US team walked out on court.  In just four years, many of those sporting events will be held just a few miles away.  The excitement here, though, is mixed with concern - and some dread.  The city is no stranger to hosting big-scale events, from the Oscars to the Super Bowl, but it is also well acquainted with the downsides of hosting major spectacles. LA is also known to have some of the worst traffic in the US, and its poor transit system is bemoaned nationally and internationally. At the time of the bid, it was hoped the Games would force the city to fix some of its transport woes, but the scrapping of plans to extend the train network, and the decision to add a fleet of buses instead, has not thrilled residents.  Nor does it bode well for the millions of tourists the Olympics typically brings to a host city.  “There's already a lot of traffic every day,” said Cory, while enjoying a burger in the bar. ""And then you're bringing people here who don't know where they're going..."" Los Angeles also has one of the highest concentrations of homelessness in the US.  Elisha told the BBC she was ""hopeful"" the 2028 Games might be a catalyst to finally addressing homelessness in the city and finding a long-term solution. The Games will celebrate LA's dramatic and picturesque coastline and the legendary Hollywood sign that hangs over the city's skyline, but the West Coast metropolis can't boast the same extravagant, historic backdrop as Paris.  But while Los Angeles might not offer iconic sites like the Eiffel Tower or the Palace of Versailles, the city has its own charms, Elisha stressed. “It’s not Paris, but LA has Hollywood - and we can make anything happen in Hollywood.""  The last time Los Angeles hosted the Olympics, in 1984, Prince topped the US Billboard singles' chart and the Games were boycotted by a Cold War-era Soviet Union over commercialisation and security issues. Great Britain won five gold medals. Among its champions were decathlete Daley Thompson, javelin thrower Tessa Sanderson, a young rower named Steve Redgrave, and 1,500m runner Seb Coe - who went to lead the World Athletics body. But the undoubted sporting superstar of Los Angeles 1984 was home talent Carl Lewis, who won gold in the men's 100m, 200m, long jump and 4x100m relay events.  The US dominated the medals table, and - unlike today - was unrivalled by China.  Among a number of historic moments, the 1984 Games saw the first women's Olympic marathon. That year's Paralympics were jointly hosted in Stoke Mandeville, England, and New York - marking the final time that a single host city did not host both the Olympics and Paralympics.   The 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles took place under the cloud of the Great Depression, in a California that was much less built-up than it is today. There was no event equivalent to the modern-day Paralympics. The Games were significantly shorter than previous editions, and saw fewer competitors than previously.  But the crowds are reported to have been huge - including a turnout of approximately100,000 people at the opening ceremony.  The year also marked the debut of the now-familiar medals podium.

1301,Palestinian horse centre vows to rebuild after West Bank demolition,"It was 07:30 in the morning in late January when Khaled Ifranji received the phone call he had always feared. He had just passed through an Israeli military checkpoint on his way from his home in occupied East Jerusalem to his work in the occupied West Bank, when one of his employees rang to say the Israeli army was ""demolishing the stables"". Khaled had spent the last seven years building the Palestine Equestrian Club - pouring all his money and every waking hour into the project. The club was built on West Bank land in the Palestinian territories, but in an area which is under full Israeli control. When Khaled arrived, it was a scene of destruction. There were four diggers demolishing everything. Khaled says his first concern was that there were still horses inside the stables. A video he shared with the BBC shows a digger striking a building while horses can be seen inside. When the horses were eventually released, they ran scared across the hillside. Khaled says one was hit by a car. Khaled asked the soldiers, “Why are you destroying my place?” He says they ignored him. He told them they should be thanking him for the work he does with Palestinian children. “I take away their anger…There’s no guns here. Just sport.” The Israeli army has confirmed to the BBC the demolition took place on 30 January but disputes Khaled's allegation that horses were still inside when it happened, despite the video evidence. They said Israeli security forces and civil administration officials had “removed all the equipment from the compound and evacuated approximately 20 horses”. They also said the structures had been built illegally, but many Palestinians, like Khaled, say permits are impossible to obtain in this part of the West Bank. Khaled, who has ridden horses for nearly 30 years, was once a member of the Palestine Equestrian Team, and competed both locally and internationally. “There's a connection that can be established between you and horses, often deeper than those formed with humans,” he says. At the time of its demolition, the equestrian club was just beginning to reach a point Khaled was happy with. He and his team had built a watering system and many of the 30 horses had their own individual stables. They had constructed two arenas, a cafe and a toilet block and the centre was being powered by solar panels and was beginning to be profitable. One of his younger clients - Shams - has been riding since she was six years old and training with Khaled for nine months now. “This place is home for me,"" she says. ""When I’m riding Calypso I feel freedom. The second I ride on him every single stress I have is gone.” When Shams’ father told her that the centre had been demolished, she was terrified for Calypso. “I was scared…We have such a strong connection. He’s my whole world.” The stables were built on a desolate hill a few kilometres south of Ramallah, the Palestinian administrative capital of the West Bank. It sits out on its own, not close to anything, a feeling of no-man’s land. As part of the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, occupied West Bank land was split into three categories - Area A under full Palestinian control, Area B under partial Palestinian control and Area C under full Israeli control.  Khaled's equestrian club is located in Area C, which makes up 60% of the West Bank.  This agreement was supposed to be temporary, but nearly 30 years later it seems to have cemented an Israeli presence. The Israeli military continues to operate in all areas of the West Bank and settlements have expanded throughout the territory, something most of the international community considers an obstacle to peace and in contravention of international law.  In July, anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now revealed Israel had approved the advance of plans for 5,295 new homes in 12 West Bank settlements as well a seizure of 5 sq miles of West Bank land, making it one of the largest land seizures in 30 years. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said Israel should stop settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and end its ""illegal"" occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a ""decision of lies"".  Khaled says Area C is the only place where there is enough space to build something like his club, away from built up areas of cities. Despite renting the land from the Palestinian ministry of religious affairs, he has been unable to get a permit to build as this is controlled by Israel. In a statement to the BBC, a representative of Cogat, the military division that co-ordinates Israeli government activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, described the demolition of the centre as an “enforcement operation… on a spot where an order forbade construction” and that Khaled’s buildings were in an area “designated as an archaeological site”. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says it's ""virtually impossible"" for Palestinians to obtain building permits, with Peace Now saying that between 2009 and 2018 only 2% of all such requests were permitted in Area C. This means it is not uncommon for Palestinians to build without an Israeli issued building permit. Many of these unauthorised buildings are at risk of Israeli demolitions. In 2023, Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem logged 554 demolitions of Palestinian houses and structures in the West Bank. Shai Parnes, a spokesperson for the group, said: “Israel’s planning and building policy in the West Bank is aimed at preventing Palestinian development and dispossessing Palestinians of their land.”  The relevant Israeli authority did not respond to this specific allegation. Just a few days after the demolition, Khaled’s friends at the club threw a birthday party for him amongst the wreckage as they began to clear the destruction. It was there and then that they decided they would rebuild. A crowdfunder was quickly set up to raise money for new, temporary structures. “They began saying to me, ‘We want to build a better club... They demolished this place so we can build a new club even more beautiful than before.'"" Part of Khaled’s busy summer programme involves running activities for kids from low-income families, as well as children with learning difficulties.  Khaled is determined that these sessions will go ahead using the rudimentary structures and arenas they have begun to rebuild.  But as well as this they have had to think of new solutions in case the Israeli authorities do come to demolish again. Thirty-year-old Reem, who runs the club’s café, has had to improvise. After the demolition of the cafeteria in January, she came up with a plan to set up a café on wheels, “something mobile that can move from place to place, minimising our losses in case they… demolish the place again”, she says. With Calypso now safely back in the stables, Shams is undeterred by what has happened and has big ambitions. “I want to compete in the Olympics for Palestine,” she says. Khaled continues to coach Palestinian children and is determined to stay on this piece of land whatever happens. “There is nothing left for me to lose"" he says. ""If they destroy it today, I will build again tomorrow. If they destroy it tomorrow I will build again the next day. This is my life. I have to continue.”",2024-08-11 23:09:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy68g5zz1wjo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1308,USA's Chiles stripped of gymnastics bronze,"Chiles was initially in fifth place before her score was upgraded American gymnast Jordan Chiles has been stripped of the bronze medal she won in Monday's women's floor final. The International Gymnastics Federation (Fig) confirmed Romania's Ana Barbosu has been upgraded from fourth to third after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). Cas upheld an appeal by the Romanian Olympic Committee that an inquiry submitted by the US team about Chiles' score fell outside the one-minute limit for such appeals and should be disregarded. Chiles' original score has now been reinstated, dropping her back into fifth place. USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee said they were ""devastated"" by the decision and condemned the ""consistent, utterly baseless and extremely hurtful attacks"" that Chiles has received on social media during the appeal process. Chiles, 23, who won gold in the women's team event, posted four broken heart emojis on her Instagram story and later wrote: ""I am taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health, thank you."" This video can not be played Biles & Chiles bow down for Andrade on podium Chiles initially scored 13.666 in Monday's final, putting her in fifth place in the competition and leading Romanian gymnast Barbosu, who scored 13.7, to believe she had won the bronze medal. However, after the inquiry by Chiles' coach Cecile Landi with regard to her difficulty rating, officials upgraded Chiles' score to 13.766, placing her third. The adjustment left Barbosu, who had begun celebrating her medal, upset and led to a protest from the Romanian team. Romania's prime minister Marcel Ciolacu called it a ""scandalous situation"" and threatened to boycott the closing ceremony. The Romanian Olympic Committee successfully appealed to Cas on the grounds the inquiry was ""untimely"" as it had been submitted four seconds after the one minute time limit. Cas reinstated Chiles' score of 13.666 on Saturday, which was later confirmed by Fig. The International Olympic Committee said it will reallocate the bronze medal to Barbosu and is in touch with the US team regarding the return of the medal and the Romanian Olympic Committee to discuss the reallocation ceremony. USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee said: ""The inquiry into the difficulty value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with Fig rules to ensure accurate scoring."" Speaking about the online abuse of Chiles, they added: ""No athlete should be subject to such treatment. We condemn the attacks and those who engage, support or instigate them. We commend Jordan for conducting herself with integrity both on and off the competition floor, and we continue to stand by and support her."" Chiles' team-mate Simone Biles won silver in the event, with Brazil's Rebeca Andrade taking gold. On the podium, Biles and Chiles bowed down to Andrade in an iconic moment of the Games. Biles posted her support for Chiles, writing: ""Sending you so much love Jordan, Keep your chin up Olympic champ, we love you.""

1309,The key questions for sport after boxing eligibility row,"Khelif (left) and Lin won in the welterweight and featherweight classes respectively Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting each won gold in boxing at Paris 2024 amid a global furore of whether they were eligible to compete in the women's division. The controversy overshadowed the boxing and, at times, dominated coverage of the Games around the world. At the closing ceremony on Sunday the boxers will be centre stage again. They have each been announced as flag bearers for their countries - Khelif for Algeria and Lin for Chinese Taipei. But the end of the Olympics does not mark the closure of this issue as sport is left facing some key questions... The World Championships were run by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA), which disqualified the two fighters for reportedly failing what it called ""eligibility criteria"" following ""gender testing"" as a result of ""many complaints from several coaches"". The IBA says blood testing on the two fighters was conducted in May 2022 and March 2023, and that the results “conclusively indicated"" that the pair “didn’t match the eligibility criteria for IBA women's events"".  Since then they have claimed that male XY chromosomes were found in both cases. IBA President Umar Kremlev also said that the tests ""show they were men"".  Lin did not appeal the decision, while Khelif did take her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), but then withdrew the appeal. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended the IBA in 2019 amid integrity and governance issues, and then stripped it of its official status last year over a failure to make reforms. The IBA also contravened IOC guidance by allowing Russian competitors at its world championships.  This dispute meant the IOC was responsible for running the boxing competition at the Paris Olympics, as it was in Tokyo. It applies less stringent eligibility criteria. Despite being informed of the IBA's test results last year, the IOC has always recognised the boxers as female athletes, insisting that because they were born and raised as women, and are registered as women in their passports, they are eligible for women's competition under their rules.  Others argue that how someone is registered is not proof of their sex. However, the IOC has also questioned the legitimacy and timing of the IBA's tests, making the point that the boxers fought for years without being tested. It also questioned the IBA's credibility, pointing to a chaotic press conference held in Paris, which featured several inconsistencies, as evidence that their test results cannot be relied upon. Lin follows Khelif by winning gold amid controversy Attacks over gender make gold sweeter - Khelif Woman's Hour: Olympics boxing controversy In 2021, the IOC issued new guidance, asking individual sports federations to develop eligibility policies of their own, rather than insisting on a blanket policy based on testosterone levels. However, with the IOC currently in charge of Olympic boxing due to the dispute with the IBA, and as the controversy around Khelif and Lin has erupted, it has faced mounting pressure to come up with stricter rules of its own to protect the women's category, and ensure fairness and safety.  This is especially the case after a number of sports federations have toughened up their own sex eligibility regulations in recent years, banning transgender women from elite female competition, and insisting that athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) medically lower their testosterone levels. There is no suggestion that Khelif and Lin are transgender. The IOC's eligibility rules for boxing therefore have not kept pace with other sports. The IOC abandoned genetic gender testing in 1999 and seems opposed to changing the rules, partly for fear of stigmatising people, saying that ""every person has the right to practise sport without discrimination"". IOC President Thomas Bach said: ""It is not as easy as some may now want to portray it - that XX or XY is the clear distinction between men and women. This is scientifically not true anymore.""  However, Bach also said: ""If somebody is presenting us a scientifically solid system - how to identify man and woman - we're the first ones to do it. We do not like this uncertainty. So, we would be more than pleased to look into it."" An IOC spokesman has also said that this ""is not a black and white issue""  They added: ""There are many women with higher testosterone levels than men so the idea that a test is some kind of magic bullet is not true. This is a minefield. If we can find a consensus we will certainly work to apply that. This is a question in all sports, we are open to listen to anyone with a solution to that question. The IOC is always trying to balance inclusivity and fairness, to put it more broadly, also safety. That is a difficult one and something we will have to look at.""  The IOC's critics argue that achieving such a balance is impossible, and that fairness and safety must be prioritised. The boxing controversy has fuelled demands for mandatory sex testing at future Olympics, with campaigners calling for the return of a cheek swab test (which the IOC moved away from in 2000). They say that the vast majority of female athletes are in favour of this. However, others have argued that more comprehensive testing is required to be sure about an individual-s genetic makeup, which would raise concerns over cost and invasiveness.

In which case Lin and Khelif will not be able to fight in its events. But with several countries boycotting IBA events, the sport is under pressure to establish a new governing body. In fact the IOC recently said ""we desperately need a federation to run boxing"", and has urged national boxing bodies to create one, or risk the sport missing out on the Olympics in four years' time. A new organisation called World Boxing was launched in 2023 and currently has 37 members, still far fewer than the IBA, but is not recognised by the IOC. As it stands, the IOC will continue to organise Olympic qualifying events which Khelif and Yu-ting can be a part off. We do not know if Khelif and Lin are athletes with DSD because the full results of the tests are confidential, and the fighters are yet to declare them. They and their supporters insist they are female.  However, because of what the IBA has claimed (and an IOC mistake when it initially said that this was not a DSD case, before having to retract the statement), this has inevitably led to speculation that they could be DSD athletes, and has renewed debate over how sports should approach the issue. It has been especially relevant to athletics, in which South African middle distance runner Caster Semenya - who was born with DSD condition 46 XY 5-ARD - twice won Olympic 800m gold. At Rio 2016, all three medallists in the women's 800m were DSD athletes, including the winner Semenya.  Several top sprinters have also been affected by the sport’s restrictions on DSD athletes, which now cover all track and field events in the female category. Namibia's Christine Mboma, who 200m silver in Tokyo, and compatriot Beatrice Masilingi have both been affected by the rule change. They along with 11 others had to miss the World Championships in Budapest last year under the new rules requiring DSD athletes competing in previously unrestricted events to suppress their testosterone levels for at least six months before returning to competition. World Athletics has claimed that while ""approximately 1 in 20,000 of the general population have a 46 XY DSD, in elite women's competition, the proportion is approximately 7 in 1,000 - a prevalence that is 140 times higher"". It argued that ""this is strong evidence of a performance advantage"". However, even within the scientific community there is debate over what physiological advantage DSD athletes actually have, depending on the type of DSD. Some say it is impossible to establish that everyone with a Y chromosome is a male and everyone without a Y chromosome is a female, and that more data is needed. World Athletics is one of a number of sports federations that have toughened up rules relating to the eligibility of transgender and DSD athletes in the women's category.  In 2018 it said DSD athletes could not participate in any women's event between 400m and one mile - unless they lower their high testosterone levels, which it claimed gives them an unfair advantage because it can boost endurance and muscle mass. It said the rules were needed ""to ensure fair and meaningful competition within the female classification"". Athletes could reduce their levels by taking specific drugs. Since then World Athletics has tightened its rules further, with DSD athletes having to have hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before being able to compete in all women's events.  Semenya insists there was ""never any unfair advantage"" and that ""sports have never been fair because of genetics"", adding that it was discriminatory and against her human rights. She refuses to undergo treatments and has been engaged in legal disputes over the case for years. World Aquatics, which has brought in similar regulations to athletics, says that all athletes ""must now certify their chromosomal sex with their national federation,"" adding that ""failure to do so, or provision of a false certification, will render the athlete ineligible"". It also reserves the right to include a chromosomal sex screen in its anti-doping tests. This video can not be played Algeria's Khelif wins boxing gold in the women's 66kg While far from the only controversy at Paris 2024, this was arguably the biggest and most divisive, with the issue dominating media conferences with IOC officials, and receiving huge amounts of coverage, especially with both fighters winning so convincingly and ultimately both claiming gold medals.  At its highest profile event, the IOC found itself accused of neglect, failing women and a denial of science. The turmoil has also tarnished Bach's final year in charge of the IOC before he steps down in 2025. It also led to global, and at times uninformed, scrutiny of the two fighters involved, especially on social media, where criticism by politicians and celebrities added to a frenzied and toxic debate over women's safety, fairness and whether the Games had been tainted.  Indeed, Khelif has filed a legal case against what her lawyer has described as ""misogynistic, racist and sexist"" cyber bullying, claiming she has been the victim of a ""digital lynching"". In his speech at the opening ceremony, Bach had referenced the ""Olympic spirit of living life in peace, as the one and only humankind, united in all our diversity"". Days later he was having to condemn the ""hate speech, aggression and abuse"" the boxing row had generated, suggesting it was part of a ""politically motivated culture war"". Bach added: ""What we have seen from the Russian side and in particular from the IBA is that long before these Games, they have launched a smear campaign against France, against the Games, against the IOC."" The war of words between the IBA and IOC was certainly an unedifying sideshow, and the boxing competition was gravely overshadowed by the storm, with several opponents of the two fighters making critical comments or staging protests. But it was also a reminder of the highly-charged and challenging geo-political context in which these Games took place. Gold medallists Khelif and Lin meanwhile will return to their countries as national heroes, but must now decide on what future they want to have in the sport, given the scrutiny they have been subject to. This is not the first furore sparked by sport's long struggle to regulate the female category of competition. But it may have been the most ferocious to date.

1311,USA top medal table after winning thrilling last gold,"This video can not be played 'What an end!' - heartbreak for France as USA snatch gold The United States snatched top spot in the 2024 Olympic medal table as their women's basketball team earned a thrilling victory over hosts France to win the final gold on offer in Paris. The fearsome US team were in danger of one of the all-time Olympic upsets but won 67-66 to take gold for a record-breaking eighth Games in a row, meaning the US moved level with China's tally of 40 golds in the medal table. But with the American team having won 44 silvers to China's 27 – they have also won 126 medals overall to China's 91 – they top the medal table for the fourth time in a row. In a repeat match-up of Saturday's men's final that was won by the star-studded US at France's expense, Team USA trailed 53-51 with five minutes to play. The occasion provided one last taste of the atmosphere of wild home support in the French capital. LeBron James, the NBA superstar and men's gold medallist for the US, was courtside, while French President Emmanuel Macron was in the stands in support of the hosts. The US edged back in front and in a dramatic finale, with the lead at 67-64, Gabby Williams sank a buzzer-beater for France, but it was judged to have come from inches inside the three-point line and that meant the USA won by a point. “It feels even better to have to gut the game out like that, really have to find it, really have to string together stops and really work together, so I'm proud of this group,” Kahleah Copper said. Paris 2024 Olympic medal table US superstars beat France to win Olympic gold Paris Olympics closing ceremony - what you need to know Team USA have finished top of the medal table at four Olympics in a row The Americans were jubilant at the finish, having won the title for a 10th time, and the French were crestfallen, but a crushed atmosphere soon turned to cheers of support.  As the silver medals were awarded to France, the home crowd burst into a rousing rendition final rendition of La Marseillaise. The result may have been agonising for France but the game was a fitting finale for these Olympics.  From Leon Marchand in the pool to Keely Hodgkinson on the athletics track and Simone Biles in the vault, 329 medal events have been contested across a thrilling 16 days in the French capital. Paris 2024 will officially draw to an end with the closing ceremony from 20:00 BST. The stature of the figures at courtside matched this remarkable finale. French NBA star and silver medallist Victor Wembanyama, plus judo gold medallist Teddy Riner, roared on their Olympic team-mates. US legend Scottie Pippen, World Cup-winning footballer Megan Rapinoe and three of the daughters of the late, great Kobe Bryant were also courtside. The American team, unsurprisingly, were huge favourites. All 12 of their squad had won an Olympic or World Cup title and the US women had not lost a match at the Games since Barcelona 1992. Gabby Williams (centre) was born in Nevada but has a French mother and scored 19 points for France The French were silver medallists 12 years ago in London and took bronze in Tokyo, but they have never won basketball gold. They defied their past to push the Americans all the way. Each of their point-scoring shots resulted in huge roars, while boos greeted the American free throws. Crucially, with three seconds on the clock, Copper held her nerve amid the distracting noise to sink both of her free throws, meaning Williams' last-gasp effort was in vain. ""Listen, great players show up whenever their name is called. I think the story of my career is just me staying ready. I'm that player,” said Copper, whose side also trailed by 10 points in the third quarter. A'ja Wilson finished with a game-high 21 points, while gold for Diana Taurasi has made her the first athlete to win six basketball golds. There was also an emotional medal for Brittney Griner, who was in tears as the American anthem played, in her first international tournament since leaving a Russian prison in a high-profile prisoner exchange in 2022. “Having a chance to play for gold, represent my country, for what my country did for me.  “This one will definitely be more dear to my heart than the other ones, for sure.

1325,Why Trump and Harris both say 'no tax on tips',"In the hotly divided US presidential campaign, a rare area of agreement has emerged: Workers’ tips should not be taxed. Former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was first out of the gate with the proposal, announcing it at a rally in June.  Vice-president Kamala Harris, the Democratic opponent, came out in favour of the plan this weekend, earning her the nickname “Copy Cat Kamala” from the Trump campaign.  It is a proposal intended to win attention for the candidates from Americans who work in service industries – restaurant workers, bartenders, hairdressers, manicurists, taxi drivers and others, who often receive a significant portion of their income in tips.  Both candidates announced their support for the idea in Nevada, a state seen as a toss-up in the election. Restaurants and hotels employ more than 20% of the workforce in the state, which is known for its Las Vegas casinos. Mr Trump said he started to champion the policy after a waitress complained to him about her taxes. Republicans, who have long favoured lower taxes, adopted it as part of their official party platform and several bills are now circulating in Congress, backed by restaurant lobby groups.  Some Democrats also have voiced support - including President Joe Biden, whose press secretary said that he backed the idea a day after Ms Harris endorsed the plan. The discussion comes as electronic payments make tips easier to trace, raising the risk of failing to report or under-reporting such income, an historically common problem. For all the buzz that ending taxes on tips has generated, however, it is a relatively niche issue. Nationally, an estimated 4 million workers regularly receive tips – less than 3% of the overall workforce, according to an analysis by Yale University's Budget Lab. What’s more, a significant share of those workers – about 37% - earn so little that they do not currently pay income taxes to the federal government at all, the analysis found. Under the current law, employees are required to disclose all tips over $20 per month to their employer. The federal government then collects a share via income and payroll taxes, which fund programmes such as Social Security. (States also have their own rules about income tax.) Americans reported $38bn in tip income to the federal government in fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which there is data.  On average, that amounted to just over $6,000 in income per taxpayer.  For some servers, however, tips can account for more than half of their hourly earnings, according to estimates from the National Employment Law Project. The financial impact is unclear: Some of the proposals in Congress focus exclusively on income tax; others would exempt tips from both income and payroll tax.  The candidates themselves have been vague.  The Tax Foundation estimates that any change would cost at least $107bn over a decade and other estimates are higher. But though eliminating taxes on tips might sound straight-forward politically, some analysts say that does not make it good policy. They argue that it would unfairly shift the tax burden to workers who do not receive tips. It also could encourage tipping to expand to new professions, which could lead to a much bigger financial impact than expected. Others argue that cutting taxes on tips would benefit employers more than workers by distracting from the real issue: that businesses do not have to pay minimum wage to staff who receive tips.",2024-08-12 23:11:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn511dgnjo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1336,Isaac Hayes' family threaten to sue Trump for $3m,"The family of the late soul singer Isaac Hayes has ordered Donald Trump to stop playing the star's song Hold On, I'm Coming at his campaign rallies. A letter sent to Trump and his team, and shared by Hayes' son on social media, threatens to sue the former US President if he does not comply by 16 August. The family is also demanding $3m (£2.4m) in licensing fees for the campaign's repeated use of the song between 2022 and 2024. The song, which was made famous by soul duo Sam and Dave, is a regular feature of Trump’s rallies, often playing before and after his speeches.  Hayes composed the song in 1966 with Dave Porter, when he was a staff writer at Stax Records. He went on to become a Grammy and Oscar-winner in his own right, with hits like Shaft and Walk On By. In their legal letter, Hayes' family claimed to have ""asked repeatedly"" for Trump to stop using the song. They go on to cite 134 occasions on which the campaign went ahead anyway. Their lawyer, James Walker, alleged that the Trump campaign has ""wilfully and brazenly engaged in copyright infringement”.  He went on to demand that the campaign remove any videos featuring the song, and issue a full statement acknowledging that Hayes' family have not ""authorised, endorsed or permitted"" the use of his music. Walker added that the requested $3m settlement is a ""heavily discounted"" figure, due to the frequency with which the campaign has played Hold On, I'm Coming.  The letter also stated that if a resolution was not made and a lawsuit was issued, the Hayes family would demand damages of $150,000 per use of the song - amounting to more than $20m (£15.7m). The Trump campaign has yet to respond to the letter or the threat of legal action. The Hayes family previously criticised Trump for playing Hold On, I'm Coming at a National Rifle Association convention, less than a week after the Uvalde school shooting in 2022, which claimed the lives of 19 people. ""Our condolences go out to the victims and families of Uvalde and mass shooting victims everywhere,"" they wrote at the time. Porter, the song’s co-writer, also wrote: ""I did not and would not approve of them using the song for any of his purposes."" Meanwhile, Sam Moore - who sang the original hit recording - objected to Barack Obama using the song in his 2008 presidential campaign. ""I have not agreed to endorse you for the highest office in our land,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""My vote is a very private matter between myself and the ballot box,"" he added.  On Sunday, Hayes' son, Isaac Hayes III, elaborated on his objections to the Trump campaign. ""Donald Trump epitomises a lack of integrity and class, not only through his continuous use of my father’s music without permission but also through his history of sexual abuse against women and his racist rhetoric,"" he wrote on Instagram.  ""This behaviour will no longer be tolerated, and we will take swift action to put an end to it."" The Hayes family are the latest in a long line of musicians to complain about the Trump campaign. The Beatles, Neil Young, Adele, Bruce Springsteen, Sinead O'Connor and Aerosmith are among the artists who have issued the politician with cease-and-desist orders. In fact, the list of artists who have protested is so lengthy that the topic has its own Wikipedia page. On Saturday, Celine Dion's team also protested against the use of her track My Heart Will Go On at a rally in Montana. ""In no way is this use authorised, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use,"" a statement read.  ""And really, THAT song?"", it added – alluding to the fact that the track was recorded for the film Titanic, about a sinking ship. However, musicians have only had limited success in stopping politicians from using their music. In the US, campaigns are required to obtain a Political Entities License from the music rights body BMI, which gives them access to more than 20 million tracks for use in their rallies. Artists and publishers can ask for their music to be withdrawn from the list, but it seems that organisers rarely check the database to ensure they have clearance. “They don’t care as much about artists’ rights as perhaps you’d want,” said Larry Iser, a lawyer who represented Jackson Browne when he sued Republican candidate John McCain for one of his songs in a 2008 commercial. (The case was later settled). ""It’s not just the Trump campaign,"" Iser told Billboard magazine. ""Most political campaigns aren’t keen about just taking the song down."" Cases rarely, if ever, head to court - with both sides typically backing down after a flurry of legal letters.",2024-08-12 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmw77w1707o,Unknown,Unknown,,True

The International Gymnastics Federation (Fig) upgraded Romania's Ana Barbosu from fourth to third in the Paris 2024 women's floor final following a Cas ruling. Cas upheld an appeal by the Romanian Olympic Committee that an inquiry submitted by the US team over Chiles' score fell outside the one-minute limit for such appeals and should be disregarded. USA Gymnastics attempted to have Cas reconsider their decision, citing new video evidence they said proved the appeal was in time. But on Monday, they revealed that request had been denied. ""USA Gymnastics was notified by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday that their rules do not allow for an arbitral award to be reconsidered even when conclusive new evidence is presented,"" said USA Gymnastics in a statement. During the final, Chiles, 23, was upgraded from fifth to third following an inquiry by her coach Cecile Landi that increased her difficulty rating. The Romanian Olympic Committee successfully appealed to Cas on the grounds the inquiry was ""untimely"" as it had been submitted four seconds after the time limit of one minute. On Sunday, USA Gymnastics submitted a letter and video to Cas appearing to show Landi's request to file an inquiry was submitted 47 seconds after the publishing of the score, while they also said she filed a second statement 55 seconds after the original posting of the score. Responding to Cas denying their request, USA Gymnastics said they will continue to press to ""ensure the just scoring, placement and medal award for Jordan"". ""We are deeply disappointed by the notification and will continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal,"" they added.",2024-08-12 23:11:09,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cnvyqrzy5njo,Unknown,2024-08-12 22:32:09,,True
1344,Sprinter set to be first transgender Paralympian,"Valentina Petrillo will represent Italy at the Paralympic Games in Paris Valentina Petrillo is set to become the first openly transgender athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games, having been selected to represent Italy in Para-athletics in Paris. The 50-year-old sprinter - who competes in the women's T12 classification, for athletes with visual impairments - transitioned in 2019. Petrillo, who will run in the T12 200m and 400m, told BBC Sport that her participation at the Games would be an ""important symbol of inclusion"". But Mariuccia Quilleri, a lawyer and athlete who has represented a number of fellow athletes who oppose Petrillo's participation in women's races, said inclusion had been chosen over fairness and ""there is not much more we can do"". Last year, Petrillo won two bronze medals at the World Para Athletics Championships. The Paralympic Games run from 28 August to 8 September. Andrew Parsons, president of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), told BBC Sport that while Petrillo would be ""welcome"" in Paris under current World Para Athletics policies, he wants to see the sporting world ""unite"" on its transgender policies. Currently, there is no unified position in sport towards transgender inclusion. The IPC allows international sport governing bodies to set their own policies. There are significant differences between World Athletics' policies and those of World Para Athletics. World Athletics has banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events. Its president, Lord Coe, said the decision was to ""maintain fairness for female athletes above all other consideration"". Under World Para Athletics' rules, a person who is legally recognised as a woman is eligible to compete in the category their impairment qualifies them for. The rules go on to say that ""World Para Athletics will deal with any cases involving transgender athletes in accordance with the International Olympic Committee's transgender guidelines (as amended by the IOC from time to time) and any applicable World Para Athletics regulations."" Parsons said last year that the IPC was not considering a ruling across all Paralympic sports. But, in an interview in Paris last weekend [10 August], he said he was only comfortable with that stance ""for the moment"". ""I do think that the sport movement has to, guided by science, come up with better answers for these situations and for transgender athletes,"" Parsons said. ""We need to, based on science, have a better and probably a united answer to this population. ""We need to come up with a valid, solid, sound answer for that population."" Asked if he was prepared for criticism of the IPC when Petrillo competes, he said: ""I am prepared for the criticism. ""But again we need to respect our rules, we cannot disrespect our rules. So sometimes as an individual I think one way or another, but we need to follow our constitution, we need to follow our own rules and in the specific sports the rules of the international federations need to be respected. ""So for the moment World Para Athletics rules allow her to compete, so she will be welcome as any other athlete."" He added: ""I think it is just fair that we treat [transgender athletes] respectfully. But I do think science should give us the answer, because we also want to be fair with the other athletes in the field of play. It is a very difficult question. And science hopefully will be able to give us the answer. And what I would like to see in the future is that the whole of sport has a united position on it.""  Who is Petrillo? In a previous interview with the BBC, Petrillo said she knew she was a woman from as young as nine. At the age of 14, Petrillo was diagnosed with stargardt disease, a degenerative eye condition. Petrillo won 11 national titles in the male T12 category for athletes with visual impairment between 2015 and 2018. With her wife's support, in 2018 she started living as a woman, and in January 2019 she began hormone therapy. ""My metabolism has changed,"" she previously told the BBC. ""I'm not the energetic person I was. In the first months of transition I put on 10kg. I can't eat the way I did before, I became anaemic, my haemoglobin is low, I'm always cold, I don't have the same physical strength, my sleep isn't what it was, I have mood swings. ""I'm not the same as before."" She said her times became slower too, adding: ""As a sportsperson, to accept that you won't go as fast as before is difficult. I had to accept this compromise, because it is a compromise, for my happiness."" However, she has won medals at both World Para Athletics Championships and National Para Championships since transitioning, and has competed in masters athletics events against non-disabled women. Sports scientist Professor Ross Tucker said: ""Male advantage is created through development and so it is essentially laid down over years and years of exposure to testosterone. The solution that sport has tried to come up with is to say well if the source of that advantage is testosterone then let's lower it and then the athlete is free to compete.  ""But that doesn’t work because there is an asymmetry there because some of the changes that testosterone causes, like the increased muscle mass, increased strength, the shape and size of the skeleton, those changes don’t go away. There are some, like haemoglobin levels, certain elements of the cardiovascular system that may go away. ""But the strength advantages, all the evidence that exists suggests that even when you remove testosterone in an adult those advantages continue to exist in that person. So therefore sport has to realise that it can’t take away that male advantage, reduce it slightly yes, but certainly it doesn't get removed. And the only conclusion you can then draw is that the person still has male advantage even when their testosterone is lower."" Asked for her reaction to her Paralympics selection, Petrillo told BBC Sport: ""I have been waiting for this day for three years and in these past three years I have done everything possible to earn it. ""I deserve this selection and I want to thank the Italian Paralympic Federation and the Italian Paralympic Committee for having always believed in me, above all as a person as well as an athlete. ""The historic value of being the first transgender woman to compete at the Paralympics is an important symbol of inclusion."" Petrillo said ""everyone will have their questions"" but only a ""minority"" will understand her story. Asked what she would say to those who do not agree with her presence in Paris and believe it to be unfair, Petrillo said: ""This is not a lifestyle choice for me, this is who I am. ""And the way I am, like all transgender people who do not feel they belong to their biological gender, should not be discriminated against in the same way that race, religion or political ideology should not be discriminated against. ""And sport that imposes rules based on a binary way of thinking does not factor this in. It is sport that has to find a solution and excluding transgender athletes is clearly not that solution. ""Ultimately, in the seven years in which transgender athletes have been able to compete in the female category, the number of instances in which they have stood out for their sporting results have been very few and far between."" In 2021, more than 30 female athletes signed a petition that was sent by Quilleri to the president of the Italian Athletics Federation and the ministries for Equal Opportunities and Sport challenging Petrillo's right to compete in women's races. When approached for comment on Petrillo's selection for the upcoming Paralympics, Quilleri told the BBC: ""Every federation can choose between the concepts of inclusion and sporting fairness. World Athletics has chosen the principle of the Olympic spirit, that is to say they have stayed true to the idea of fair competition. ""On the other hand, the Italian Paralympic federation has chosen inclusion.  ""It is the visually-impaired athletes who will be beaten by Valentina Petrillo that will have to take up the protests with their federation. For unfortunately it is those at the top of the federations who have allowed this to happen.""",2024-08-12 23:11:09,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cpvymmpyjeko,Laura Scott,2024-08-12 16:11:09,,True

Not today!"" It wasn't just the ESPN commentator who was shocked. Heather O'Reilly had scored the game's final goal, dragging world number ones and two-time champions United States to a 2-2 draw in their opening match at the 2007 Women's World Cup. O'Reilly wasn't surprised by the scoreline though. Or how evenly-fought the game was. She knew it would be tough. Instead, as the final whistle blew, it was the attitude of the US's opponents, who saw a chance missed, rather than a point gained, that struck her. ""I remember North Korea seeming disappointed,"" says O'Reilly. ""Their body language seemed to say 'oh my gosh, we were so close to taking down the giant'."" North Korea is the world's most isolated country, a state based around the infallibility of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and a deep suspicion of the outside world. Yet, despite living standards being well behind most other nations, North Korea has been one of the strongest female football nations on the planet. When they took on the United States in 2007, they were ranked fifth in the world and amid a run of three Asian titles in the space of a decade. Their record at youth level is even better. In 2016, they won the U20 Women's World Cup, defeating Spain, the United States and France in the knockout rounds. That same year, their under-17 team also lifted their age-grade World Cup. ""The game in 2007 was challenging, really super hard,"" remembers O'Reilly of her meeting with North Korea's senior side. ""It was hard to get the ball off them, they were buzzing around, very quick."" There was another challenge though, one that was unique to North Korea. ""It was just such a cloud of uncertainty,"" says O'Reilly. ""The film we had on them was very limited, even by the standard of the times. ""Every time we played North Korea, it was always a mystery."" The mystery now is, after a doping controversy and a four-year absence from international football, can North Korea's women be a force once again? O'Reilly (centre) competes for the ball during the United States' 2-2 draw with North Korea at the 2007 Women's World cup O'Reilly and her United States team-mates may have lacked footage of North Korea. Brigitte Weich certainly doesn't. The Austrian filmmaker spent five years following the North Korean team, gaining unprecedented access to its inner workings and players for her 2009 documentary Hana, dul, sed., external She says that, like with most things in North Korea, the country's over-sized impact on the women's game is attributed to the man at the very top. ""The players constantly said to us that the Dear Leader Kim Jong-il [Kim Jong-un's predecessor] personally supported women's football,"" says Weich. ""Of course, they refer everything directly to the leader and nothing happens without him guiding, supporting or wanting it. ""But it is a very hierarchical and totalitarian dictatorship and I think that is kind of true."" Weich (centre, in blue jacket) followed the North Korean team at the 2003 Asian Cup, the 2003 Women's World Cup and the qualification tournament for the 2004 Olympics Weich relays a theory that North Korea's focus on women's football sprung from a stage in Mexico in 1986. At that year's Fifa congress, Norwegian Ellen Wille, only 4ft 11in tall, stepped up to the lectern and started her speech – the first by a woman at a Fifa Congress - with a scream of anger., external She was infuriated by the sidelining of the women's game, which had been consigned to half a page in Fifa's weighty annual report. She demanded a World Cup for women. Fifa, shell-shocked, agreed. And, the theory goes, the North Korean delegates in the room returned to Pyongyang with a plan. ""Maybe someone came to Kim Jong-il and said to him that we could use this,"" says Weich. ""North Korea is not the best in economics, science, human rights and the rest, but in countries like this they can be good at some sports because, from the top down, they can focus on training and nothing else. ""I don't think it is a total myth that Kim Jong-il had an interest in women's football, perhaps because he saw it as a chance to show up at a world level."" North Korea celebrate a goal against Sweden at the 2007 Women's World Cup The plan was simple, sweeping and efficient. Formal football training at school from an early age, scouts sent out across the country, and, for the best, a central school of excellence and a raft of army teams allowing them to train and develop full-time at the state's expense. The material rewards for North Korea's players aren't big-money contracts or overseas moves. Instead relocation, rather than remuneration, is the lure. For many in North Korea, life is unremittingly grim. Shortages in food, healthcare and heating are common, particularly in rural areas. A United Nations report in 2023 detailed the forced labour and sexual violence that is common in detention centres, which citizens can be transferred to for various crimes against the state. Some of those who have escaped the country have recounted women prisoners undergoing forced abortions., external Pyongyang presents differently. Living standards and leisure opportunities are better than in the provinces. High-rise appartment blocks, a 150,000-capacity stadium, bowling alleys, department stores, a zoo, and a fairground are part of a faded Soviet-era cityscape of concrete monumentalism. ""It seems to be a privilege to live in Pyongyang and not in the countryside,"" says Weich. ""The players received, as a gift from the leader, apartments in Pyongyang and could bring their parents to Pyongyang. Being picked for the team can be a career for a woman and her entire family - it can be life-changing."" The Kim family dynasty has ruled the country since its founding in 1948. Kim Jong-un, the grandson and son of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il respectively, has been in power since 2011 In the 2000s, when England's women would rarely attract crowds in five figures, North Korea were packing out the 50,000-capacity Kim Il-sung Stadium. Whether or not all the spectators attended willingly - crowds of military personnel or whole factory workforces have been used as the backdrop to state occasions - the players are high-profile figures. ""They are stars,"" says Weich. ""Fans know them, recognise them and ask them for autographs."" ""There was even a soap opera based around the women's football team, with fictional troubles - parents opposing them playing or forbidden love affairs and so on."" Getting on the national team also means players can get out of the country. North Koreans are not allowed to travel abroad without permission from the state. International tournaments and fixtures bring players into contact with realities unknown to many of their compatriots. ""The players I followed said 'the Americans are much taller than us and much stronger than us, because they have enough food and all kinds of things we don't have - but our minds are so strong, no-one expects that',"" remembers Weich. ""They all loved football, but the leader and the nation were big motivations. ""That is how they are brought up: the glory of the nation is everything and the individual is nothing."" North Korea women warm up at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang before an 8-0 win over Taiwan in April 2007 At the 2007 Women's World Cup, after drawing with O'Reilly's United States, North Korea progressed from the group ahead of Sweden and Nigeria, before losing to eventual winners Germany in the quarter-finals. ""At that World Cup in 2007, we were staying at the same hotel as North Korea and I clearly remember having a moment when we were in the elevator with some of the North Korea players,"" says O'Reilly. ""I remember thinking it would be cool to try to talk or play cards or anything to have some kind of cultural breakthrough. ""But it was definitely a fleeting thought because it didn't appear that they wanted to engage much. Perhaps it was unfair of me to think, but there were not a tonne of smiles and eye contact being exchanged. They were all business in that elevator. ""But you have those thoughts about what is their training like, what is their preparation like, when did they get into the sport - I was always so curious about their backstories."" Their 2011 campaign was notable for different reasons - North Korea's women were caught up in football's biggest doping scandal in a generation. Five of their players tested positive for a rare kind of steroids. North Korea's explanation was even rarer. They said that the positive tests were caused by a traditional medicine made from the glands of a musk deer., external Officials explained it had been administered to the players after lightning struck their training ground back in North Korea. Were North Korea's players powered by something more than patriotic fervour, a systemic focus on the female game and a sweat-soaked training regime? Five members of North Korea's 2011 Women's World Cup team tested positive for a rare kind of steroid, causing their expulsion from the next edition in 2015  A suspicious Fifa banned them from the 2015 World Cup. With their qualification seeding dented by their suspension, North Korea failed to make the 2019 tournament. They were then absent from the 2023 tournament as well, after North Korea withdrew from the international scene under some of the toughest Covid restrictions in the world. Last autumn, on their return to action, North Korea won silver at the Asian Games. They narrowly missed out on a place at the Paris 2024 Olympics after a 2-1 aggregate defeat by Japan in a two-legged play-off in February. No-one quite knows what sort of force the team will be able to muster in the future. Can a wealth of youth talent translate into senior strength? Or will the development of the women's game around the rest of the world, and North Korea's isolation from it, leave them with too much to make up? How much have the pandemic border closures forced the authorities to refocus on more essential needs of its people, amid reports of starvation? As with most things about North Korea, from the broadest intentions to the smallest detail, it is a mystery.

1358,Ex-county clerk found guilty of election interference,"A former Colorado county election official was found guilty on Monday of tampering with voting machines after the 2020 presidential election.  A jury found former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a Republican, guilty on seven out of 10 counts in the election interference case.  Peters has become well known among election deniers who falsely believe the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump.  Peters pleaded not guilty to all counts in 2022.  The case represents the first time a local election official has been prosecuted over a suspected security breach during the 2020 election.  ""Tina Peters willfully compromised her own election equipment trying to prove Trump's Big Lie,"" Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement. ""Today's verdict sends a clear message: we will not tolerate any effort to threaten the security of our gold standard elections,"" she added.  The jury deliberated for over four hours on Monday before returning the verdict. Four of the seven charges Peters was found guilty on are felonies.  The former county clerk was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state. Prosecutors say Peters engaged in ""a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people,"" according to the indictment.  Prosecutors said Peters helped breach the county's election computer systems and allowed an unauthorized individual to access voting equipment and election records. The person posted secure election equipment images online.  Peters became ""fixated"" on voting problems after the 2020 presidential election that some falsely believe was rigged against Trump, prosecutors said.  Investigators also issued a search warrant for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a proponant of election fraud claims, in connection to Peters' case, BBC's American partner CBS News reported.  Peters is set to be sentenced on 3 October. Her attorney could not be reached for comment. ",2024-08-13 23:10:13,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c985yz5qepeo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

1393,Uproar forces Kenyan city to remove athlete statues,"Authorities in the Kenyan city of Eldoret have removed the statues of three athletes after they were widely ridiculed and described as ""embarrassing"" and a poorly done ""joke"". The statues were unveiled ahead of Thursday's ceremony giving Eldoret city status. However, local residents and Kenyans online said they bore little resemblance to the athletes they allegedly represent. Eldoret is known as the ""home of champions”, as it is at the centre of the Rift Valley, where most of Kenya’s world-beating athletes come from.  The statues were removed overnight before President William Ruto officially designated Eldoret a city. The town this week unveiled several artistic works, including three statues of athletes and other monuments such as a maize cob and a milk fountain. They were supposed to represent the area’s sports and agricultural heritage and were erected at various strategic roundabouts in the town. But the artworks immediately drew widespread criticism, becoming objects of ridicule rather than the pride they were supposed to elicit. A Kenyan who shared a photo of a statue of a female athlete suspected to represent 1,500m world-record holder Faith Kipyegon, said the works represented “our collective mediocrity as a country”.  “It’s a disgrace calling it a Faith Kipyegon statue,” another Kenyan on X said.  Yet another X user shared a purported statue of marathon legend Eliud Kipchoge terming it a “joke”, saying “whoever did this will not see heaven”. On Thursday morning, local media shared images of an empty pedestal where one of the statues had stood. A local reporter told the BBC that county officials removed the three statues on Wednesday night, two representing female athletes and one of a male, taking them to an unknown location. The authorities have not indicated who they represent but social media users have described one as a statue of Kipyegon and another of Kipchoge. But their depiction of the athletes has been described as ""shameless"", ""embarrassing"" and ""substandard"".  Kenyans online have been welcoming the removal of the statues. It was not clear whether they would be replaced, or when. Ahead of the ceremony to declare Eldoret Kenya's fifth city, President Ruto hosted athletes who won medals at the 2024 Olympics. They were each rewarded with money in accordance with a government scheme meant to motivate athletes for good performance. Kenya was the highest-ranked African country at the Paris Olympics, coming 17th on the medal table with four golds and a total of 11 medals. Kipyegon won the 1,500m title in a new Olympic record of 3min 51.29sec, the first woman to win three consecutive golds in the event. She also took silver in the 5,000m. However, Kipchoge did not finish the marathon after a back injury forced him to drop out. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

1394,Gymnast Chiles target of racist abuse after medal row,"Jordan Chiles was initially in fifth place before her score was upgraded US gymnast Jordan Chiles says she has received online racist abuse after an appeal over the decision to strip her of the bronze medal she won at the Paris 2024 Olympics. The International Gymnastics Federation (Fig) upgraded Romania's Ana Barbosu from fourth to third in the women's floor final following a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) ruling. It meant that Chiles, 23, lost her bronze medal after initially being upgraded from fifth to third because of an inquiry by her coach Cecile Landi that increased her difficulty rating. Since the decision, Cas has refused to review its decision and condemned ""outrageous statements"" that it was biased. Reports in US media had suggested the head of the Cas panel making the decision in the case had links to Romania. Chiles said the ""decision feels unjust and comes as a significant blow"" and that she has faced abuse during the process. ""To add to the heartbreak, the unprompted racially driven attacks on social media are wrong and extremely hurtful,"" she said in a statement posted to X on Thursday.  ""I've poured my heart and soul into this sport and I am so proud to represent my culture and my country."" Chiles was a member of the US team - which included Simone Biles - that won gold in the women's team gymnastics. Cas condemns 'outrageous statements' over Chiles ruling Chiles stripped of bronze as online abuse condemned Cas won't review ruling that cost Chiles bronze Chiles said she believes that ""at the end of this journey, the people in control will do the right thing"". USA Gymnastics attempted to have Cas reconsider its decision that led to Chiles being stripped of her medal, citing new video evidence it said proved the challenge was made in time. But on Monday, it revealed that request had been denied. ""I had confidence in the appeal brought by USAG, who gave conclusive evidence that my score followed all the rules. This appeal was unsuccessful,"" Chiles said on Thursday. On Monday, USA Gymnastics (USAG) said it ""strongly disagrees"" with Cas' detailed decision. Chiles added on Thursday: ""I will approach this challenge as I have others - and will make every effort to ensure that justice is done."" The women's floor final took place on 5 August and Romania appealed to Cas the following day. USA Gymnastics said it did not become aware of the case until 9 August, which it said was two days past the deadline to submit objections related to panellists. USA Gymnastics claimed this was because Cas sent case filings to ""incorrect email addresses"". On Sunday, USA Gymnastics submitted a letter and video to Cas appearing to show Landi's request to file an inquiry was submitted 47 seconds after the publishing of the score, while they also said she filed a second statement 55 seconds after the original posting of the score. USA Gymnastics has said it will ""pursue these and other matters upon appeal"" as it continues to ""seek justice for Jordan Chiles"".",2024-08-15 23:21:40,https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c4gz87ne17xo,Unknown,2024-08-15 20:21:40,,True
1407,Presenter Woods received death threats after Olympics boxing comment,"Laura Woods announced she was pregnant in July TV presenter Laura Woods has revealed she received ""numerous death threats"" online after commenting on an article about the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting. They each won gold in their respective weight divisions at Paris 2024 amid a heated public debate over whether they should be eligible to compete in the women's division.  Khelif from Algeria and Lin from Chinese Taipei were disqualified from last year's World Championships after reportedly failing gender eligibility tests. Both won gold in Paris after being cleared to take part by the International Olympic Committee. On Thursday, football presenter Woods commented ""great article"" in reply to a post by the Telegraph's Oliver Brown,, external who had written on the subject. Woods, who works for TNT Sport and was part of ITV Sport's coverage of Euro 2024 in Germany, said she had received dozens of hate-filled messages. ""Since I replied to this article I've had numerous death threats to myself and my unborn child,"" Woods posted on X, external. ""Questions on my own gender (I'm pregnant so guess that clears that one up) calls for my employers to sack me, threats to my home. ""When there are discrepancies with test results - which could impact the safety of another human being, in an environment that above all else should be fair - questions are quite rightly going to be asked. ""The answers are still unclear, otherwise this topic would be closed."" Khelif and Lin were disqualified by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA) during last year's World Championships.  The IBA said Khelif and Lin ""failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out in the IBA regulations"". The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which ran the boxing events at the Olympics, allowed them to compete. It raised doubts about the tests and strongly criticised the IBA, insisting Khelif and Lin were ""born and raised as women"". President Thomas Bach said last week that the IOC ""does not like the uncertainty"" but suggested there is no ""scientifically solid system"" to ""identify men and women"". Khelif said she had been a victim of ""bullying"" and that the IBA ""hate me and I really don’t know why"".

1421,Vance plane makes emergency landing due to malfunction,"A charter plane carrying Republican candidate for Vice-President JD Vance was forced to make an emergency landing after a door malfunction on Friday. The Boeing 737 had departed from an airport in Milwaukee, where the Ohio senator was attending a campaign event with police officers, and had to turn back for repairs shortly after take-off. After being fixed, the plane continued on to Cincinnati, where Mr Vance lives. Last week, former President Donald Trump was forced to divert course and make an emergency landing as he flew to a rally in Montana. Mr Vance was travelling with his wife Usha, his dog Atlas, his campaign staff, and reporters when the emergency was declared on Friday afternoon. A spokeswoman for Mr Vance, Taylor VanKirk, issued a statement, saying: ""The pilot advised there was a malfunction with the door seal.""  ""After declaring an emergency, Trump Force Two returned to Milwaukee. As soon as the issue was resolved, the plane returned to its originally planned flight path back to Cincinnati.” According to the New York Times, the pilot made an announcement about four minutes into the flight asking passengers to fasten their seatbelts.  ""Secret Service agents aboard the plane reacted with confusion and laughter, and it was not immediately clear to some passengers that there was an emergency until after the plane had landed,"" the paper reported. The pilot reportedly came back over the intercom after landing to apologise for the “elevated heart rates”. Earlier this month, planes belonging to both Mr Vance and Vice-President Kamala Harris happened to coincidently be parked near each other in Wisconsin. Having a ""bit of fun"", Mr Vance strolled over to the aircraft used by each US vice-president and told reporters: ""I just wanted to check out my future plane."" In May, Trump's plane clipped a parked private corporate jet as it taxied on a Florida tarmac.  No injuries were reported and it was unclear whether Trump was on board the aircraft.

1411,Which countries are trying to disrupt the US election?,"The recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America.  And the nature of America’s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. “Our adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. “We are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it"". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China. “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,” US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July.  The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House.  He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.  On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza. “Russia remains the predominant threat to US elections,” according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence.  But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls ""active measures"" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War.  And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked. Russian hackers – likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU – are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts.  Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic. China is the wildcard in terms of interference.  It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it ""probably does not plan to influence the outcome"" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China’s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything.  Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration’s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.  Beijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations. Back in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data.  And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not.  However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared.  But America’s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result.",2024-08-16 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86ljyv38vxo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

Ms Harris met her now-husband, Los Angeles entertainment lawyer Doug Emhoff in 2013, while she was serving as California’s attorney general. They were married the following year. Since then Mr Emhoff, 59, has stuck close to his wife’s side as she has risen in the ranks of US politics. In 2020, when Ms Harris made history as the first black and South Asian woman to become vice-president, Mr Emhoff made history too as the first husband of an American president or vice-president, as well as the first Jewish spouse of a vice-president.  He left his law firm that year to focus full-time on his role as ""second gentleman"", a position that has pulled him out of relative obscurity. He is now known as an enthusiastic  champion for Democratic party causes and Ms Harris’s most loyal surrogate on the campaign trail. The vice-president’s marriage made her a step-mother to Cole and Ella, the two children Mr Emhoff shares with his first wife, Kerstin Emhoff. Ms Harris has said often that of all her many titles, being ""Momala"" - the term coined by Cole and Ella - is the most important. That affection seems to go both ways - Cole and Ella, now 30 and 25, respectively, have been vocal supporters of Ms Harris.  ""The world’s greatest step-mother"", was Ella’s introduction during the 2020 Democratic convention. ""You’re a rock, not just for our dad, but for three generations of our big, blended family."" Cole, who graduated from Colorado College in 2017, has followed his father into the entertainment industry, with jobs at talent agency WME and, later, Brad Pitt’s production company Plan B. Ella, who graduated from Parsons School of Design in New York City, signed with IMG Models in 2021 and walked in shows for high-fashion brands like Balenciaga and Proenza Schouler. She’s also an artist and a prolific knitter, who launched the knitwear brand and club Soft Hands in 2021. Cole and Ella’s mom, Kerstin, has - perhaps unexpectedly - gone out of her way to speak warmly and positively of Ms Harris. Recently, Kerstin came to Ms Harris’s defence when JD Vance’s ""childless cat lady"" comments resurfaced. ""For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,"" Kerstin said in a statement to CNN. ""She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it."" Kerstin, the founder and CEO of production company Prettybird, even provided her creative expertise and connections to the 2020 campaign. ""They were like, 'The ex-wife wants to do what?'"" Kerstin said to Marie Claire in 2020. Kamala Harris is known to be very close to her only sibling and younger sister, Maya Harris. After their parents’ divorce, the two girls were primarily raised by their mother, Shyamala Gopalan, in Berkeley, California. Like her older sister, Maya pursued a career in law, graduating from Stanford University law school in 1992. She worked as a litigator and taught law classes before joining the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California, where she became executive director in 2006. Maya, 57, eventually shifted to politics, serving as a senior policy advisor to Hillary Clinton on her 2016 presidential campaign. She then served as campaign chair to her sister’s failed 2020 bid for Democratic nominee, before becoming a surrogate for the Biden-Harris ticket. Maya’s only child, Meena, followed the Harris family tradition by graduating from law school. Meena advised her ""Aunty"" Kamala through the early stages of her political career, as she moved through positions at elite Silicon Valley companies like Uber, Facebook and Slack. Beginning in 2017, the mother of two launched Phenomenal, a media and merchandising company that focuses on projects led by women and other underrepresented groups. But Meena’s career is still linked in some ways to her aunt’s. In June 2020, she published a children’s book about her aunt and mother called ""Kamala and Maya’s Big Idea"". And after Mr Biden selected Ms Harris as his running mate, Phenomenal began selling “Vice President Aunty” sweatshirts. Husband to Maya, step-father to Meena, Tony West is another accomplished member of the Harris clan, and another lawyer.  A graduate of Stanford law (where he met Maya and her then-toddler daughter), Mr West has worked at high levels of the private and public sector. He was associate attorney general under President Barack Obama and worked as general counsel of PepsiCo.  Mr West is now the chief legal officer of Uber, but he's also emerged as a key adviser to his sister-in-law's campaign.  Uber said this month he would take a leave of absence to devote himself to Team Harris.  ""I have always believed family comes first,"" Mr West said in a statement. ""So I’ve decided to dedicate myself full-time to supporting my family and my sister-in-law on the campaign trail.""    Although Dr Shyamala Gopalan died before she could see her daughter run for president, Kamala and Maya Harris say their scientist mother inspired both of their careers. ""My mother was the first person to tell me that my thoughts and experiences mattered,"" Ms Harris wrote on Facebook in 2022. “My mother would often say to me: 'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things. Make sure you are not the last.'"" Ms Gopalan, who died in 2009, moved to the US from India at age 19 to study science, going on to work as a breast cancer researcher. Her activism in the civil rights movement led her to her future husband: economist and Jamaican immigrant Donald Harris. Ms Harris has credited her mother with raising both her and Maya and her current relationship with her father is unclear.",2024-08-16 23:11:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylqv3g4rwo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1448,Why this Democratic convention will not be like Chicago in 1968,"When 21-year-old Indiana University philosophy student Craig Sautter drove to Chicago for the 1968 Democratic National Convention, he had an ""inkling"" that he would be in for a ""wild day"". There had been a series of riots after the back-to-back assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy just months before, and he could tell that simmering tensions were ready to boil over when thousands of protesters, police, politicians and delegates gathered that August to pick who would be the next Democratic candidate for president. Yet the young anti-Vietnam War activist was still shocked by what he saw: National Guardsmen with bayonets, protesters ripped from cars or beaten with police batons, and thick clouds of tear gas wafting through crowds of thousands. ""We were mostly middle-class kids, or business people who were there in suits, protesting against the war,"" Mr Sautter recalled. ""We never thought that the police would attack an unarmed group of people who were just singing and shouting... we were in disbelief."" Ultimately, more than 600 protesters were arrested and over 100 treated for injuries, alongside 119 police officers. Scenes of the violent clashes in the streets and parks of Chicago soon flashed on TV screens across the country, and the world, leaving an unforgettable image of America in chaos. ""People were chanting that the whole world was watching,"" added Mr Sautter, now a professor at Chicago's DePaul University who researches presidential conventions. The return of the DNC to Chicago in 2024 has led many to look back at 1968 and draw parallels. Like back then, there will be anti-war protests - this time against the Biden administration's support for Israel during the war in Gaza.  And like back then, there has been a surprising change of guard amongst Democratic leadership. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election months before the convention, while this time, President Biden pulled out of the race with merely weeks to go. But experts and veterans of the 1960s protest movement believe the differences far outweigh the similarities. Nonetheless, some of those involved in planning the anti-Gaza war protests at the upcoming DNC say they draw inspiration from the activists who took to the streets of Chicago nearly 60 years ago.  ""This is the Vietnam War of our era,"" Hatem Abudayyah, a spokesman for the Coalition to March on the DNC, told the BBC. ""The attacks on our movement, our students and our organisations are similar to the attacks on the movement that was trying to stop 1968... I absolutely see those parallels."" The coalition includes over 200 organisations involved in the protests, and its spokespeople have said that ""tens of thousands"" of participants are expected.  The size of the protests has prompted Chicago's police department to warn that it won't tolerate ""violent actors"" or incidents of vandalism or criminality.  Mr Abudayyah says there has been ""no evidence of any violence"" during protests organised by the coalition or its member groups since the conflict in the Middle East began 10 months ago. Others have dismissed any real similarities to 1968. ""Other than the fact that they're in Chicago, there are none,"" long-time Democratic National Committee member and DNC delegate Elaine Kamarck told the BBC. ""This is not even close."" One key difference, according to Ms Kamarck, is that the Chicago police employed ""very, very thuggish tactics"" 56 years ago. A federally-mandated commission later accused the force of a ""police riot"" at the DNC.  Just months before, then-Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley had also issued ""shoot to kill"" orders in the wake of riots after Martin Luther King's death.  ""All hell was breaking loose,"" said Ms Kamarck, who was 18 at the time. ""There's no such thing going on now.""  Ms Kamarck's assessment was echoed by Marsha Barrett, a professor of US political history at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.  ""Daley had very strong control over police, and an antagonistic relationship with protesters,"" she said. ""The city had set up a situation where there was likely to be a major conflict.""  ""We don't have that now,"" she added.  Chicago police have been in regular touch with DNC protest groups and have vowed to protect their rights to free speech, provided that the protests remain lawful.  ""The understanding of police activity at that time was that the would use whatever force was needed to overcome resistance,"" said Mr Sautter.  ""Now the police are better trained,"" he added. ""They're not going to provoke anything unless some kind of violence breaks out.""  Among those who witnessed the violence first-hand was Abe Peck, then editor of the Chicago Seed, an underground newspaper linked to the Youth International Movement, or Yippies, that planned events around the 1968 convention. ""We were in our office, which was in a dry cleaners', and all of a sudden our window fragmented,"" remembers Mr Peck, who was later credited with creating the ""whole world is watching"" chant. ""Two shots were fired through it. Fortunately nobody was hit."" When they ran outside to investigate, Mr Peck saw only one vehicle: a Chicago police cruiser.  The incident was one of several which marked his experiences of the DNC, which also included the police ""stomping out"" religious ministers tied to the counterculture movement. That violence, Mr Peck told the BBC, stands in stark contrast to today. Social media and the immediate spread of news could create a public relations disaster if police were seen to be too aggressive. ""Back then, there was a real delay in getting news out. Now, it's essentially instantaneous,"" Mr Peck said. ""That's a big difference.""  Don Rose, who in 1968 was a spokesman for the National Mobilization Committee to End the War, one of the main protest groups, told the BBC that an even more significant difference was the Vietnam War itself.  That war, unlike the Gaza war, saw tens of thousands of Americans drafted, many of whom were killed or wounded overseas.  ""The country was far more divided on the Vietnam War at that time. The protests expanded greatly because of the draft,"" said Mr Rose, now 93.  ""We were protesting at a convention that would nominate someone who could end the war with the stroke of a pen,"" he added.  The Democratic Party at the time was also deeply divided over the war, and when delegates arrived at the DNC of 1968, they had no idea who would be leaving with the nomination.   When then-vice president Hubert Humphrey was finally chosen as nominee over anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy, some in the audience even shouted “No!”. ""The convention was totally divided, and at war with itself,"" explained Mr Stautter. ""For [Kamala] Harris and Walz, it's totally unified."" Mr Peck, for his part, said that more recent versions of the DNC can no longer be called ""nominating conventions"". ""These are just confirmation conventions,"" he said. ""They confirm what the people in states did at the primary levels. That's really different."" Ultimately, Hubert Humphrey went on to lose the 1968 election to Republican Richard Nixon. Looking back, Mr Stautter - who will be watching the convention on TV this year - believes that the protests of 1968 had an impact on the US that could never be replicated in 2024. ""People who watched were totally radicalised by it, and many, many more people became involved in trying to stop the war,"" he said. ""A whole generation, whether they were there or not, were marked by it.""",2024-08-17 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jl0p4vklyo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1444,How Raygun made it to the Olympics and divided the breaking world,"When breaker Rachael Gunn – aka Raygun – bombed out of the Paris Olympics, the shockwaves hit a tiny hip-hop scene on the other side of the world. In a Sydney warehouse-turned-community centre, breakers warm up with ab exercises that would make a Pilates teacher cry, before taking to the floor with acrobatic moves so intricate you can barely make them out. It is one of the most important events of the year – a qualifier for the Red Bull BC One World Finals – and the past week weighs heavy. A few people nervously glance at the handful of cameras lining the dance circle, their minds no doubt flashing to images of Gunn which have set the internet alight. “I feel like it's just pushed our scene in Australia into the Dark Ages,” Australian hip-hop pioneer Spice told the BBC. Gunn, a 36-year-old university lecturer, lost all three of her Olympic battles in viral fashion, her green and gold tracksuit and unorthodox routine – which included the sprinkler and kangaroo-inspired hopping – generating waves of memes and abuse. The fallout has divided and disappointed the Australian breaking community. “It made a mockery of the Australian scene and I think that's why a lot of us are hurting,” Spice says. Many have rushed to defend Raygun against the onslaught.  Others are ready to admit there are questions to be answered over her qualification and performance, but say the global bullying has undermined any attempt to fairly analyse what went down in Paris. Gunn has always been a dancer - albeit in jazz, tap and ballroom first - but it was her husband and coach Samuel Free that introduced her to the world of breaking when she was 20. She says it took years for her to find her place in the male-dominated scene. “There were times that I would go into the bathroom crying because I was so embarrassed at how terrible I was at this,” she told The Guardian Australia ahead of the Olympics. Eventually though, Gunn became the face of breaking in Australia – a top-ranked B-girl and an academic with a PhD in the cultural politics of the sport. And at an Olympics qualifying event in Sydney last October, where 15 women from across Oceania competed, Raygun emerged triumphant and officially booked her ticket to Paris. Like Gunn, breaking was perhaps a surprising candidate for the Olympics. Born in the cultural melting pot that was the Bronx in the 1970s, the street dance quickly became a global phenomenon. And in recent years – alongside urban sports like skateboarding and BMX freestyle – it caught the eye of Olympics chiefs desperate to attract new and younger audiences. Some argued it didn’t deserve Olympic attention, while others insisted a competition like that could not capture breaking’s essence and would only further divorce the artform from the street culture it came from. All eyes were on the event in Paris to see if the Olympic Committee’s gamble would pay off. From the moment the final B-girl battle at the Olympics wrapped up, it was clear that breaking had indeed captured global attention – or, more specifically, Raygun had. Rumours and criticism of her performance spread like wildlife, particularly online. Gunn received a torrent of violent messages. An anonymous petition demanding Gunn apologise was signed by 50,000 people. She was accused - without evidence - of manipulating her way onto the world’s biggest stage at the expense of other up-and-coming talent in the Australian hip-hop scene. Some people shared a conspiracy that she had created the governing body which ran the Oceania qualifiers, and a lie that her husband - who is also a prominent member of the breaking community and a qualified judge - was on the panel that selected her. Australian factchecking organisations and AUSBreaking, the national organisation for breaking, quickly tried to correct the record, but that didn’t stop the flood. Then there were those arguing that she had mocked hip-hop culture. ""It just looked like somebody who was toying with the culture and didn't know how culturally significant it was,” Malik Dixon told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In a series of statements, AUSBreaking stressed that judges were “trained to uphold the highest standards of impartiality” and that not a single person on the nine-person panel for the Oceania qualifiers was Australian. And while AUSBreaking has had many “interactions” with Raygun since its conception in 2019, at no point had she ever held a leadership position or been involved in “any decision making over events, funding, strategy, judge selection or athlete selection”. Taking to Instagram to rubbish all the “crackpot theories”, Te Hiiritanga Wepiha - a Kiwi judge on the Oceania qualifying panel - said Raygun won fair and square. “All us judges talked about how she was going to get smashed, absolutely smashed [at the Olympics]… She knew it was going to be rough, so it's actually courageous of her,"" Wepiha – also known as Rush – said in a livestream Some of the country’s most decorated athletes and highest Olympic officials also loudly defended Gunn. ""The petition has stirred up public hatred without any factual basis. It's appalling,"" the Australian Olympic Committee’s Matt Carroll said in a statement. Gunn herself had previously said she was “never” going to be able to beat her powerful competitors, so had “wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative”. In a video posted to social media in the eye of the public storm, Gunn added that she had taken the competition “very seriously”. “I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics and I gave my all. Truly.” She had only been trying to “bring joy”, she said. ""I didn't realize that that would also open the door to so much hate, which has frankly been pretty devastating.” Some within the Australian hip-hop community admit the response to Raygun’s routine initially elicited “a chuckle” - but it quickly got out of hand. Everyone was unequivocal in condemning the sheer volume of abuse, ridicule and misinformation that has targeted Raygun and the broader Australian B-girl community. But beyond that, feeling is somewhat split. Many B-girls say Raygun’s performance does not reflect the standard in Australia. “When I first saw it, I was so embarrassed,” Spice – who retired from breaking years ago – says. On any other stage, Raygun would have been encouraged and supported for “having a go”, Spice says, but people representing the country need to be at a certain level. “It’s the Olympics for God's sake!” “In hip-hop we have this thing, you step up or you step off… You need to know your place.” She stresses, though, that the “bullying is just disgusting”. The impact of the controversy on local Australian B-girls has been ""devastating"", Tinylocks says. ""[We’re] allowed to be angry,” she told the BBC.  She, like some others the BBC spoke to, said they did not want their full names published because the scale of abuse circulating. B-girl’s videos are being trolled, their DMs inundated with insults and violent threats. Young dancers are being harassed at school, and many now feel unsafe practising in public. Tinylocks – who herself has battled Raygun – thinks Gunn simply had a terrible day, and questions her routine choices. “We know you're capable of more… Were you set up for success?” According to Wepiha, the Oceania panel judge also known as Rush, Gunn's victory in qualifying reflects the size of the “tiny” breaking scene in Australia, and the even tinier public and government support for it.  ""I mean, we had to actually get people out of retirement to make up the numbers,"" Rush said. ""That's how small the scene is."" Others says there were rules which may have made a small talent pool even shallower – like the requirement that potential qualifiers be a member of AUSBreaking and that they have a valid passport, in line with rules put forward by the World Dance Sport Federation. AUSBreaking did not respond to the BBC’s queries about Raygun’s selection, the financial support it receives or how it seeks out the country’s best breaking talent. But Steve Gow, the group’s secretary and long-time b-boy Stevie G, tells the BBC the size and isolation of Australia inhibits the growth and development of the scene. Being so distant from other, bigger hip-hop communities abroad can make it hard – both in terms of the time and money required – to learn from them. “It can be very insular,” he says.  As if proving the point, he regularly pauses to greet almost everyone who walks into the Red Bull competition, which he is judging.  He insists there is still a high quality of breaking in Australia. Ultimately, the community is bitterly hurt by the world’s response.  They feel breaking isn’t truly understood, and that people have piled on without knowledge or context. “It’s a big disappointment because they’re not talking about the winners… they’re all talking about Raygun’s memes, and they’re not even seeing her full set,” Samson Smith – a member of hip hop group Justice Crew and a breaker for over two decades – told Network 10. But many hope a silver lining may yet emerge. ""She might actually bring enough attention to get resources,” Rush said. “At the end of the day, Australia has the most famous Olympian of 2024 and she might actually save the scene here.""

1443,Trump and Harris battle over election’s biggest issue,"After almost a year off the platform, Donald Trump returned to X this week and asked his 89 million followers: “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” It was a clear echo of the famous quote from Ronald Reagan during his victorious 1980 presidential campaign, when he asked: “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” This messaging isn’t surprising. It seems like an obvious strategy for Trump to focus on the economy. That’s because polls consistently suggest it’s the issue American voters care about the most. One such poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov in recent days listed “inflation/prices” and “jobs and the economy” among voters’ top concerns.  Perhaps more importantly, polls also indicate voters are deeply unhappy with the current state of affairs. That seems like a perfect situation for any presidential challenger. But in an election that’s been transformed by Kamala Harris taking over from Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, Trump seems to be struggling to land his simple message on the economy. It is less than a month since he was on stage at the Republican National Convention looking unbeatable, having survived an assassination attempt and riding high in the opinion polls. Now, he has lost that lead and seems to have lost his way. Meanwhile, in the opposition corner, Ms Harris is riding a wave of excitement and enthusiasm that he is finding difficult to counter. The easiest way to burst her bubble would be to remind voters how unhappy they are about high prices and blame her for the inflation that has pushed up the cost of living during the time she has been beside President Biden in the White House. One of the reasons Trump is failing to land that message is the Harris campaign’s strategy of putting proposals to try to lower the cost of living at the heart of her pitch. In a speech in North Carolina on Friday, Ms Harris promised to expand child tax credits, help people to purchase their first homes, and to encourage the building of more affordable housing. She also said she hoped to tackle the persistently high price of food and groceries by banning “price gouging” or excessive corporate profiteering.  ""By any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world,” she said. “Many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives."" Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ought to be able to boast about some very good economic indicators. There is strong growth, record levels of job creation, and this week the inflation rate fell below 3% for the first time during Mr Biden’s presidency. But because prices are still high, voters don’t feel any better off. Voters don’t care about the rate of inflation – they care about the level of prices. “A central banker wants inflation to get back to target. A shopper wants his or her old price back,"" Jared Bernstein, the chair of President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a July speech. When it comes to the economy, “the vibes are off”. “Vibes matter,” Mr Bernstein said. So will the bad economic vibes hurt the Harris campaign? That is what I asked voters over lunch at a crab shack on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Jeff Tester, who works in a nearby marina, said high prices are really hurting him.  “I get paid by the hour. I get up to go to work every day. I think you have to do that to get the American dream,” he said. “But I just know it's getting harder.” And he is very clear about who he sees as responsible. “I blame the Democrats. I believe their policies are hurting the working man,” he said. Every diner I met complained about inflation, but not everyone held Mr Biden or Ms Harris responsible. Dan Nardo, a retired boat broker, said he believed the pandemic, oil prices, foreign wars and supply chain issues have more to do with price rises than the US president. His friend Randy Turk, a retired lawyer, told me that he felt a new administration is likely to follow a similar path to try to reduce inflation, regardless of who wins.  “It's not like a different president can really make that much of a difference,” he said. Ms Harris struggled for prominence and media coverage during most of her time as vice-president. Previously that was seen as a weakness. But if it means she can emerge untainted by “Bidenomics”, it could be one of her greatest strengths. Ruth Igielnik, polling editor at the New York Times, says the latest data she has collected suggests “voters very much tied their negative feelings about the economy to Joe Biden”. Talking to me on the BBC’s Americast podcast,  she explained that in her polling Trump is still favoured on the economy, but where he once had an 18-point lead over Mr Biden he now leads Ms Harris by only about 8 points. “That makes me think voters aren’t necessarily attaching their feelings about the economy to her,” she said. A separate poll this week conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business indicated Ms Harris holds a narrow lead over Trump on who Americans trust to handle the economy. No wonder Republicans are publicly begging Trump to focus on the issues, the economy in particular, and stop launching personal attacks against Ms Harris. In a speech this week, Trump told supporters he was going to talk about the economy but struggled to stay on topic. “They say it’s the most important subject,” he said, ""they"" referring to his advisers and strategists who believe this is his strongest line of attack. “I’m not sure it is. But they say it’s the most important,” he added, before going on to list immigration, crime and the way Ms Harris laughs as top issues. You could practically hear his campaign managers pulling their hair out. “Voters don’t care about personalities or who is drawing larger crowd sizes,” said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. “Independent, undecided, swing voters in key states care about the economy and inflation so just focus on those core issues,” he said.  “Stay focused on talking about how you are going to make the lives of Americans better over the next four years.” It was back in 1992 that the Democrat Jim Carville coined the slogan “It’s the economy, stupid” while he was working on Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign. It’s advice that every campaign since has clung to. But Trump, this time around, seems to be finding it uncommonly difficult to stick with. It ought to be a winner for him. After all, according to the Financial Times poll, in answer to his question “Are you better off now than you were when I was president?” only 19% of voters say they are.",2024-08-17 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl2xjxlz3xo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1452,"What to know about US election hacking, Iran and other countries","The recent claim by Donald Trump's campaign that they were hacked by Iran is one sign that foreign interference may become a prominent issue in this year's US election. The election result will have major implications around the world, meaning many countries have an incentive to try and interfere to either support a particular candidate or just to destabilise America.  And the nature of America’s open democracy and media, coupled with new forms of technology, provides many potential avenues to try and shape the eventual outcome. “Our adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last month. “We are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it"". So who might be trying to interfere? Three countries are most widely cited: Iran, Russia and China. “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,” US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in July.  The Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran, although it has not been confirmed that an offer of stolen campaign documents to news outlets was definitely linked to this. Microsoft recently said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran, and Google has said Iranian hackers targeted the Biden campaign (before he dropped out of the race) as well as that of Donald Trump. The assessment is that the Iranians are more likely to be opposed to a return of Trump to the White House.  He and his advisers are seen as more hawkish in their rhetoric as well as in their past actions, which include pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and killing top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.  On social media, Iran has also been accused of stoking tensions over Gaza. “Russia remains the predominant threat to US elections,” according to the most recent assessment by US intelligence.  But so far it has been less visible than Iran. Russia has a long track record of using what it calls ""active measures"" to influence public opinion back through the Cold War.  And in 2016, the US was caught largely unaware by a Russian operation which saw the Democratic Party as well as Hillary Clinton's campaign operatives have their emails hacked and then leaked. Russian hackers – likely from both the foreign intelligence agency the SVR and the military intelligence agency the GRU – are among the most skilled and may try to compromise accounts.  Russian social media campaigns have also moved on from 2016 when fake profiles were used to organise real-world demonstrations against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Moscow is thought to be outsourcing some efforts to commercial firms in order to distance itself and look for more effective ways of reaching audiences. If Moscow does get involved, security analysts believe it it would most likely be to favour Trump. The former president has been more friendly to Moscow and more critical of the NATO defence alliance. Russia's Vladimir Putin recently denied he was backing Trump, but even that was seen as a diversionary tactic. China is the wildcard in terms of interference.  It has hacked US campaigns to gather intelligence all the way back to 2008. But it tends to be less active than the other two in trying to influence a particular result. US intelligence currently believe it ""probably does not plan to influence the outcome"" of the election. There is also less confidence as to who China’s preferred candidate might be should it decide to do anything.  Donald Trump can be unpredictable and confrontational with Beijing but is less likely to continue the Biden administration’s policy of building a web of alliances, which has worried Beijing.  Beijing may also be wary of antagonising the US at this point by being seen to interfere, something neither Iran nor Russia worry so much about. But China is accused of trying to target candidates at a local or congressional level because of their backgrounds or positions on issues of concern to China. In the 2022 mid-terms it was assessed of doing so in a handful of races involving both Democrats and Republicans. All three countries have consistently denied carrying out election interference operations. Back in 2016, material hacked by Russia received extensive media coverage. But that seems to have changed now with media outlets more cautious about giving prominence to stolen data.  And there there are more people now looking for influence operations as well as improved cybersecurity defences around campaigns. But despite this, the challenge has evolved. One complexity is that it can be harder to disentangle foreign interference from domestic free speech. Some countries may use Americans to seed or spread their messages. Sometimes those Americans will be willing collaborators, but sometimes they will be unwitting, perhaps even engaged to write for websites which they do not know work for Moscow or someone else. And there are new worries because there has been a step change in the technology on offer to those seeking to interfere thanks to artificial intelligence and deepfakes. These potentially allow more tailored approaches to individuals over social media, and the creation of more convincing faked content. This could lead people to doubt what is real and what is not.  However, in other elections around the world this year, the general consensus is that these techniques have not been deployed as much as some feared.  But America’s election is by far the most consequential globally (and also likely a tight race) meaning new techniques might be deployed for the first time. And given the political atmosphere this time is more combustible and polarised than in the past. A further risk, too, is that even the claim that there has been foreign interference can be politicised and used to cast doubt on an election result.

1453,Kamala Harris's positions on 10 key issues,"Days before the Democratic National Convention, Vice-President Kamala Harris is riding high on a wave of favourable polls and energetic rallies. But beyond the good vibes, where does the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee stand on key issues?  Although she has yet to release a comprehensive platform, her time as a California senator and prosecutor, her 2020 bid for the presidency and role in the White House as vice-president give hints as to where Ms Harris stands on a number of policies.  Over the years, some of her positions have shifted and some have said that she has struggled to define herself.  To get a better understanding of what her policy agenda now might look like, BBC News reviewed Ms Harris' recent speeches and public statements as a 2024 candidate, her record as vice-president and her political history as a 2020 presidential candidate, California senator and prosecutor. Ms Harris's campaign told the BBC that the candidate's most recent statements best reflect her intentions if elected president. “Vice President Harris will build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic agenda that beat Big Pharma, created nearly 16 million jobs, and delivered on the first bipartisan gun safety legislation in three decades,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement. Here are Ms Harris' positions on 10 key issues. As a senator, Ms Harris championed a number of progressive policies, including paid family leave, affordable housing and free tuition for low-and-middle income families.  As vice-president, she has been Mr Biden's partner in passing major economic legislation - regularly labelled ""Bidenomics"" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy. But with inflation and high interest rates continuing to bedevil American wallets, polls have shown that the economy continues to be top of mind for many voters. On Friday, Ms Harris released her economic plan, including mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation. And like her opponent, former US President Donald Trump, she has come out against taxing tips.  ""As president, I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability and dignity. Together, we will build what I call an opportunity economy,"" she said Friday. Ms Harris's position on the border has changed from when she first ran for office. In 2020, while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, she held fairly progressive positions - such as promising to close down immigration detention centres. In 2021, Mr Biden asked Ms Harris to oversee the diplomatic effort around immigration issues on the US southern border to reduce numbers arriving there.  Many Republicans have characterised her as a ""border tsar"", but she was tasked specifically with working with Central American countries on the ""root causes"" of why people there were fleeing to the US.  As part of that effort, she announced in 2023 that she had helped raise about $3bn - largely from private companies - to invest in communities in the region, hoping to provide opportunities that would make immigrating to the US less attractive.  Earlier this year, she aided the effort to pass a hardline bipartisan border security deal that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction. But Trump helped kill the deal, accusing Biden's border policies of causing ""death, destruction, and chaos in every American community"". Her campaign said that, if she were elected president, she remains committed to ""bipartisan solutions to strengthen border security"".  Ms Harris has long supported women's right to an abortion.  She played a key role in the Biden campaign's effort to make abortion rights central to the 2024 election, and she has long advocated for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide.  That position has not changed.  “When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,” she said at a rally for her 2024 campaign in Atlanta, Georgia. She was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and she toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to speak about the growing number of abortion bans in the US - often framing the issue as one about personal freedom. Powerful pro-choice advocacy groups, such as Emilys List and Reproductive Freedom for All, have officially endorsed Ms Harris since she started her presidential run.  While much of her early career focused on the state of California, since going to Washington as a senator in 2017, Ms Harris has become more involved on the global stage. As senator, she traveled to  Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and Israel. As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries. She attended the Munich Security Conference in the past year, and she delivered remarks in support of western security alliance Nato that denounced isolationism. She has also vowed to support Ukraine in its war against Russia “for as long as it takes”. Ms Harris represented the US in June at the “peace conference” convened by Ukraine in Switzerland where she reaffirmed Washington's support. Within 48 hours of her candidacy becoming public, 350 leading US foreign policy and national security experts - largely Democrats - released a letter endorsing her as the ""best qualified person"" to lead the country in international affairs. Ms Harris has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution. As vice-president, she was more open to criticising Israel during the Israel-Gaza war than Mr Biden. She was one of the first members of the administration to call for an ""immediate cease-fire"", raised concerns over the ""humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians"" and charged Israel with ending the conflict.  She held what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July. As the presumptive Democratic candidate, she said she told Mr Netanyahu that she had ""serious concerns"" about casualties in Gaza and that the way Israel defended itself mattered.  ""It is time for this war to end,"" she said after face-to-face talks at the White House.  She has not supported an arms embargo on Israel, however, as some on the US left have called for.  Her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, said on X that she ""has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups"". In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes, co-sponsoring a bill with Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments. As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%. This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also supported, of an increase to 28%. A campaign official told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal of not raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (£310,000).  As California's attorney general, Ms Harris and her office often used anti-trust laws to keep insurers, hospitals and drug companies from raising customer costs. When she became a US senator and later a 2020 candidate for president, she held more progressive views than Mr Biden, supporting expanding Medicare and publicly-funded health-care programmes.  Medicare is US government-funded healthcare that covers those aged 65 and older and those younger with disabilities.  Ms Harris previously had supported Medicare for All, a policy that would allow all Americans access to the system. It was a position that became popular among many progressive Democrats before Mr Biden's presidency.  During the same period, she also backed eliminating private healthcare insurance but then partially walked that back, releasing a plan during her 2020 presidential campaign that would put the US on track to offer government-funded health insurance over 10 years but wouldn't fully eliminate private insurance companies.  That's not the case now. Her campaign told the BBC that, as president, she would not push for a single-payer system.  While she was vice-president, the White House reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage. Ms Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, then California's attorney general.  Her offices increased conviction rates, particularly of violent criminals, though that history led to criticism from the progressive left, which at times labelled her ""a cop"". Meanwhile, the right has accused her of being soft on crime, although her record is contradictory. As a prosecutor, she declined to seek the death penalty against someone who killed a cop, but as California's attorney general, she fought for the state's right to keep using it. Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. Ms Harris has long advocated for tough laws to protect the environment.  As a prosecutor, Ms Harris defended California's climate laws and sued oil companies for environmental damage. She also called for climate change policies via a ""Green New Deal"" during her 2020 presidential campaign - some of which has come to fruition under the current administration.  During a CNN presidential debate in 2019, she said that ""there is no question I'm in favour of banning fracking"", which is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. She has reversed her position since throwing her hat into the 2024 presidential race.  As vice-president, she helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programs.  Last year, she noted in a speech that it constituted ""the largest climate investment in our nation's history"" and emphasised the need to protect against extreme weather.  Ms Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career, and she successfully defended California's gun laws when they faced legal challenges as the state's attorney general.  As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and earlier this year announced the creation of resource centres to support the implementation of red-flag laws - aimed at keeping firearms from those who may harm themselves and others.  She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programs.

The 22-year-old won gold over the distance at the Olympic Games in Paris and has now targeted one of the oldest track world records. Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova ran a record 800m time of one minute and 53.28 seconds at Munich’s Olympic Stadium in July 1983. Hodgkinson's winning time in Paris was 1:56.72, but her confidence has soared since clocking 1:54.61 in London in July. Speaking at a special 'Team GB's Homecoming' event at Manchester's AO Arena, Hodgkinson said: ""It's definitely something I've thought about since I raced in London.  ""I think that record has stood for so long. It's been a long time since anyone has hit [one minute and] 53 seconds, so I'd love to do that. I think I can. I now believe I can do that."" How did Team GB win their Olympic medals? Presenter Woods received death threats after Olympics boxing comment Team GB 'exhausted but happy' on return from Olympics Olympic 1500m bronze medal winner Georgia Bell said she is still undecided about whether to become a full-time athlete. The 30-year-old only returned to running three years ago having fallen out of love with the sport.  Bell still works for a a cyber security software company in London. ""I've been on a break over the summer to focus on the Olympics and the plan is to go back in September,"" she said. ""Work have been super-supportive and we'll see what happens. I think it will be really difficult to balance both. So it's something I'm going to think about."" Toby Roberts became the first Briton to win an Olympic medal in sports climbing after he dramatically took gold in the boulder and lead event in Paris. The 19-year-old said things had ""been a bit of a blur"" since and it still ""feels surreal to have this medal round my neck right now"". He added: ""I've always seen myself as a climber who loves competing and to be among all these great athletes in this environment feels like a dream really.""

1471,How Raygun made it to the Olympics and divided breaking world,"When breaker Rachael Gunn – aka Raygun – bombed out of the Paris Olympics, the shockwaves hit a tiny hip-hop scene on the other side of the world. In a Sydney warehouse-turned-community centre, breakers warm up with ab exercises that would make a Pilates teacher cry, before taking to the floor with acrobatic moves so intricate you can barely make them out. It is one of the most important events of the year – a qualifier for the Red Bull BC One World Finals – and the past week weighs heavy. A few people nervously glance at the handful of cameras lining the dance circle, their minds no doubt flashing to images of Gunn which have set the internet alight. “I feel like it's just pushed our scene in Australia into the Dark Ages,” Australian hip-hop pioneer Spice told the BBC. Gunn, a 36-year-old university lecturer, lost all three of her Olympic battles in viral fashion, her green tracksuit and unorthodox routine – which included the sprinkler and kangaroo-inspired hopping – generating waves of memes and abuse. The fallout has divided and disappointed the Australian breaking community. “It made a mockery of the Australian scene and I think that's why a lot of us are hurting,” Spice says. Many have rushed to defend Raygun against the onslaught.  Others are ready to admit there are questions to be answered over her qualification and performance, but say the global bullying has undermined any attempt to fairly analyse what went down in Paris. Gunn was always a dancer - albeit in jazz, tap and ballroom first - but it was her husband and coach Samuel Free that introduced her to the world of breaking when she was 20. She says it took years to find her place in the male-dominated scene. “There were times that I would go into the bathroom crying because I was so embarrassed at how terrible I was at this,” she told The Guardian Australia ahead of the Olympics. Eventually though, Gunn became the face of breaking in Australia – a top-ranked B-girl and an academic with a PhD in the cultural politics of the sport. And at an Olympics qualifying event in Sydney last October, where 15 women from across Oceania competed, Raygun emerged triumphant and booked her ticket to Paris. Like Gunn, breaking was perhaps a surprising candidate for the Olympics. Born in the cultural melting pot of the Bronx in the 1970s, the street dance quickly became a global phenomenon. And in recent years it caught the eye of Olympics chiefs desperate to attract new and younger audiences. Some argued it didn’t deserve Olympic attention, while others insisted a competition like that could not capture breaking’s essence and would only further divorce the artform from the street culture it came from. All eyes were on the event in Paris to see if the Olympic Committee’s gamble would pay off. From the moment the final B-girl battle at the Olympics wrapped up, it was clear that breaking had indeed captured global attention – or, more specifically, Raygun had. Rumours and criticism of her performance spread like wildfire, particularly online.  Gunn received a torrent of violent messages, and an anonymous petition demanding she apologise was signed by 50,000 people. She was accused - without evidence - of manipulating her way onto the world’s biggest stage at the expense of other talent in the Australian hip-hop scene. Some people shared a conspiracy that she had created the governing body which ran the Oceania qualifiers, and a lie that her husband - who is also a prominent breaker and a qualified judge - was on the panel that selected her. Australian factchecking organisations and AUSBreaking, the national organisation for breaking, quickly tried to correct the record, but that didn’t stop the flood. Then there were those arguing that she had mocked and appropriated hip-hop culture. ""It just looked like somebody who was toying with the culture and didn't know how culturally significant it was,” Malik Dixon told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In a series of statements, AUSBreaking stressed that judges were “trained to uphold the highest standards of impartiality” and that not a single person on the nine-person panel for the Oceania qualifiers was Australian. And while AUSBreaking has had many “interactions” with Raygun since its conception in 2019, at no point has she ever held a leadership position or been involved in “any decision making over events, funding, strategy, judge selection or athlete selection”. Taking to Instagram to rubbish all the “crackpot theories”, Te Hiiritanga Wepiha - a Kiwi judge on the Oceania qualifying panel - said Raygun won fair and square. “All us judges talked about how she was going to get smashed, absolutely smashed [at the Olympics]… She knew it was going to be rough, so it's actually courageous of her,"" Wepiha – also known as Rush – said in a livestream Some of the country’s most decorated athletes and highest Olympic officials also loudly defended Gunn. ""The petition has stirred up public hatred without any factual basis. It's appalling,"" the Australian Olympic Committee’s Matt Carroll said. Gunn herself had previously said she was “never” going to be able to beat her powerful competitors, so had “wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative”. In a video posted to social media in the eye of the public storm, Gunn added that she had taken the competition “very seriously”. “I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics and I gave my all. Truly.” She had only been trying to “bring some joy”, she said. ""I didn't realize that that would also open the door to so much hate, which has frankly been pretty devastating.” Some within the Australian hip-hop community admit the response to Raygun’s routine initially elicited “a chuckle” - but it quickly got out of hand. Everyone was unequivocal in condemning the sheer volume of abuse, ridicule and misinformation that has targeted Raygun and the broader Australian B-girl community. But beyond that, feeling is somewhat split. Many B-girls say Raygun’s performance does not reflect the standard in Australia. “When I first saw it, I was so embarrassed,” Spice – who retired from breaking years ago – says. On any other stage, Raygun would have been encouraged and supported for “having a go”, Spice says, but people representing the country need to be at a certain level. “It’s the Olympics for God's sake! “In hip-hop we have this thing, you step up or you step off… You need to know your place.” She stresses, though, that the “bullying is just disgusting” - and many like herself have been reluctant to speak up out of fear of adding to Gunn's anguish. But the impact of the controversy on local Australian B-girls has also been ""devastating"", Tinylocks told the BBC. Like some others the BBC spoke to, she did not want her full name published because the scale of abuse circulating. B-girl’s videos are being trolled, their DMs inundated with insults and violent threats. Young dancers are being harassed at school, and many now feel unsafe practising in public. ""Telling us to be positive and supportive while we are being harmed is unacceptable... [we’re] allowed to be angry,” she said in a statement.  Tinylocks – who herself has battled Raygun – thinks Gunn simply had a terrible day, but says there are questions about her preparation and routine that need answering. “We know you're capable of more… Were you set up for success?” According to Wepiha, Gunn's victory in qualifying reflects the size of the “tiny” breaking scene in Australia, and the even tinier public and government support for it.  ""I mean, we had to actually get people out of retirement to make up the numbers,"" he said. ""That's how small the scene is."" Others says there were rules which may have made a small talent pool even shallower – like the requirement that potential qualifiers be a member of AUSBreaking and that they have a valid passport, in line with rules put forward by the World Dance Sport Federation. AUSBreaking did not respond to the BBC’s queries about Raygun’s selection, the financial support it receives or how it seeks out the country’s best breaking talent. But Steve Gow, the group’s secretary and long-time b-boy Stevie G, tells the BBC the size and isolation of Australia inhibits the growth and development of the scene. Being so distant from other, bigger hip-hop communities abroad can make it hard – both in terms of time and money – to learn from them. “It can be very insular,” he says.  As if proving the point, he regularly pauses to greet almost everyone who walks into the Red Bull competition, which he is judging.  He insists there is still a high quality of breaking in Australia. Ultimately, the community is bitterly hurt by the world’s response.  They feel breaking isn’t truly understood, and that people have piled on without knowledge or context. “It’s a big disappointment because they’re not talking about the winners… they’re all talking about Raygun’s memes, and they’re not even seeing her full set,” Samson Smith – a member of hip-hop group Justice Crew – told Network 10. But many hope a silver lining may yet emerge. ""She might actually bring enough attention to get resources,” Wepiha said. “At the end of the day, Australia has the most famous Olympian of 2024 and she might actually save the scene here.""

1474,Tim Walz has Irish roots - but where exactly?,"Kamala Harris' presidential running mate Tim Walz is the latest American politician to have their roots traced back to Ireland - but where exactly his ancestors are from is a matter for debate. The 41st governor of Minnesota's relatives are said to have hailed from County Wexford. American genealogist Megan Smolenyak, who has been tracking politicians' roots since Barack Obama first ran for president in 2008, believes his ancestors are from Ferns in the county. However, local genealogists are suggesting it is Kilmore which is about 52km down the road. Ms Smolenyak told BBC News NI that Mr Walz was ""about 1/8th Irish"", pointing out that his ancestors moved to Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska. She said, according to records, Mr Walz's great-grandmother was called Laura Ellen Sullivan. ""A surname like Sullivan is a clear sign that you have Irish ancestry,"" she said. ""I started working backwards then following the trail from there.  ""His ancestor's name was Sullivan. I found James Sullivan who was from Ireland, his daughter was Laura Ellen Sullivan."" The hunt is now on for distant relatives of the man who could be another American in the White House with Irish connections. Whichever way the US presidential election goes, Fianna Fáil senator Malcolm Byrne from County Wexford is hoping a relationship can be built with Mr Walz. ""Certainly from a Wexford perspective, we'd like to develop the links with the governor of Minnesota,"" he said. ""There are a number of local historians and genealogists who are looking at the research that's being uncovered in the US. Originally we thought it may be from the town of Ferns that the connection was based. ""It is now possible it might actually be from the village of Kilmore, but there are certain connections between what would have been the Diocese of Ferns."" The Emerald Isle will almost certainly retain some representation in top level US politics when Joe Biden leaves the White House in January. Mr Walz becomes the second running mate with claimed ancestry from the island in this year's presidential election, after Donald Trump announced 'Scots-Irish hillbilly at heart' JD Vance as his pick for vice-president. And, of course, Joe Biden is inordinately proud of his own personal Irish heritage - he had ancestors in County Mayo and County Louth. He mentions it at every opportunity.  During the election campaign in 2020 he was asked for a ""quick word for the BBC"".  He swiftly replied: ""The BBC? I'm Irish!"" In 2021, the US Census Bureau stated that 31.5 million people in the United States reported having Irish ancestry - that is about 9.5% of the population. The New England region of the United States has the highest proportion of people claiming Irish ancestry, according to the US Census Bureau. The peak of Irish emigration came around the Great Famine where nearly two million people - about a quarter of the population - emigrated to the United States during a 10-year period. County Wexford can already claim one former president as John F Kennedy's family hailed from Dunganstown in the county. Each one of President Kennedy's eight great-grandparents was born in Ireland and moved to Massachusetts in search of a better life around the time of the Great Famine. Whether it is Kilmore or Ferns, for people in the county there is now an interest in how Tim Walz will do in the upcoming election. Dean of Ferns, Paul Mooney, is hopeful. He told BBC News NI: ""If Mr Walz is successful, I am sure that it would be seen as a positive for Ferns."" And Senator Byrne sees the Irish link as an opportunity to strength relations with the US.  ""I'm one of the conveners of the Ireland US Parliamentary Friendship group and we've always been looking at ways to support connections between US and Irish parliamentarians,"" he said. ""This is very positive in terms of trade, education, culture, tourism, all of those other links that that are really important.""

The Paris Olympics bronze medallist retained a healthy lead on the front nine before his challenge seemed to be slipping away as he lost four shots on a four-hole stretch, which included a disappointing tee shot into water on the 14th.

1494,"Iran hacked Trump campaign, US intelligence confirms","Iran was behind the recent hack of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, US intelligence officials have confirmed.  The FBI and other federal agencies said in a joint statement that Iran had chosen to interfere in the US election ""to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions"".  The Trump campaign earlier this month pointed the finger at Iran for the hacking of internal messages. Iranian officials denied it.  The Republican's campaign was reportedly sent a spear-phishing email – a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link. “The [intelligence community] is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties,” US intelligence officials said in the statement.  ""Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the US election process."" The statement appeared to confirm previous reports that Iran had tried to hack US Vice-President Kamala Harris's campaign as well. The Harris camp said last week it had been the target of an unsuccessful spear-phishing attack. The agencies that released Monday's statement, including the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the tactics were ""not new"" and noted that Russia and Iran had employed such methods during previous US elections.  It remains unclear what information, if any, was stolen during the hack. Trump said the hackers were only able to obtain publicly available information.  But the goal, officials said, was clear: Iran wants to shape the outcome of elections it believes are ""particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests"".  The US agencies added that they had ""observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle"". There has been growing concern about potential Iranian hackers. Recently, Microsoft said it had seen ""the emergence of significant influence activity"" by groups linked to Iran.  Before he dropped out of the White House race last month, President Joe Biden's campaign was targeted by Iranian hackers, as was Trump's, according to Google.

1499,Trump falsely implies Taylor Swift endorses him,"Donald Trump appears to have falsely implied he has Taylor Swift's endorsement, posting fake images on social media of the singer and her fans supporting him. The Republican presidential candidate posted the massage ""I accept!"" alongside the images, which were taken from other social media accounts. Many appear to have been created using artificial intelligence.  The post sparked a backlash among Swift's fans, known as Swifties, who accused Trump of spreading misinformation. The singer has not endorsed a candidate in the 2024 election but backed the Democrats in 2020 and criticised Trump while he was president. One of the photos shared by Trump depicted Swift fans wearing t-shirts that read: ""Swifties for Trump"".  The post appeared to have a label of ""satire"" with a headline that read: ""Swifties turning to Trump after ISIS foiled Taylor Swift concert"".  Swift recently cancelled three concerts in Vienna following a possible security threat. Police arrested two people on suspicion of planning attacks inspired by the Islamic State group. Another re-posted photo mimicked a World War One US army recruiting poster, which replaced Uncle Sam's face with Swift's and read: ""Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump"".  NBC News reported two of the images Trump re-posted feature real women who are Trump supporters.  Swift supported the Democratic Party in the 2020 election, and criticised Trump during the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd.

1498,What to expect from the 2024 Democratic National Convention,"With just three months to go before the 2024 election, thousands of people are gathering in Chicago this week for the Democratic National Convention. It's a tradition dating back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered in Baltimore to nominate him for a second term. This year will look slightly different from others, as the party has already officially nominated Vice-President Kamala Harris in a virtual roll call after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. But many of the other DNC traditions - including appearances from celebrities and memorable speeches from party leaders - will remain the same. Here’s what to know. This year’s convention is taking place at the United Center Arena in Chicago from Monday 19 August to Thursday 22 August. Because Ms Harris and Mr Walz have already been nominated, this year's convention will focus on speeches from prominent Democrats and the adoption of the party’s platform. Delegates work during the day to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence. In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it. Dozens of prominent Democrats and celebrities will be taking the stage in Chicago. President Biden will headline the convention on Monday night, and his record will be honoured throughout the evening.  The crowd will also hear from First Lady Jill Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Maryland Rep Jamie Raskin, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other Democratic leaders. Americans affected by abortion bans in Republican-controlled states and voices from the labour movement - including United Auto Workers President  Shawn Fain - will be heard as well. The first evening of the DNC will ""showcase Kamala Harris’s commitment to fighting for everyday Americans"" with a particular focus on ""freedom"", DNC officials told reporters.  On Tuesday, former President Barack Obama is expected to deliver remarks, as is former First Lady Michelle Obama. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Ms Harris’s husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, will also address the convention on Tuesday. Wednesday’s line-up reportedly features former President Bill Clinton and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, among others. Ms Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will give the prime-time speech that night after his nomination. The most important night of the convention is Thursday, when Vice-President Harris will take the stage. She will formally accept the presidential nomination and give her speech on the final night of the convention dedicated ""For the Future"". Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will also take the stage at some point during the week.   Famous politicians aren’t the only ones who will make an appearance. The convention will also hear from several everyday Americans, including Trump voters. Around 50,000 people are expected to attend this year's convention in Chicago. This includes thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties as well as super delegates, who are major elected officials, notable members of the Democratic Party and some members of the Democratic National Committee. Thousands of members of the media will also be in attendance. It will be a star-studded convention with appearances from several celebrities. In 2020, actors Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Eva Longoria attended the convention, while Elizabeth Banks and America Ferrera appeared in 2016. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will attend this year, but neither has confirmed. Demonstrations are planned for outside the DNC venue, many of which are centred around opposition to US support of Israel’s war in Gaza. Organisers have said as many as 10,000 people could take part in marches. Protesters have been haggling with the city of Chicago about where they can demonstrate. Members of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there will be plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself will offer live-streams on social media platforms. You'll be able to follow BBC News coverage - featuring on-site reporting and analysis - across the website and app, and on our live-stream.  The BBC News Channel will carry special coverage from 20:00 ET (01:00 BST) each night.

1508,The bizarre siege behind Stockholm Syndrome,"The six-day bank siege that inspired the controversial Stockholm Syndrome theory began on 23 August 1973. In 1980, a BBC documentary featured two pioneering New York police negotiators who had built their careers on the lessons they had learnt from hostage situations past, including this bizarre robbery attempt. ""But Sven, it's only in the leg."" Those were the words of Kristin Enmark, 23, who was one of four people being held hostage at gunpoint in a Swedish bank. It was day two of the siege, and robber Jan-Erik Olsson wanted to show the police he meant business by shooting her terrified bank colleague Sven Säfström. Enmark told the BBC's Witness History in 2016: ""Jan said to him, 'I'm not going to hurt any bones in your leg; I'm just going to shoot in the part that is not going to make so much injury'.""   Looking back, she struggled to comprehend her callous reaction. She said: ""In that situation, I thought that he was somehow being a coward, not letting himself be shot in the leg. I think it's awful for me to think that and to say that, but I also think it shows what can happen to people when they are in a situation that is so absurd. It is a situation that makes this moral shift. I really feel ashamed about this."" Although Olsson did not carry out his plan, Säfström later admitted he had also felt grateful to his captors, and had to force himself to remember these were violent criminals and not his friends. The term Stockholm Syndrome was coined in the aftermath of the siege by Swedish criminologist and psychiatrist Nils Bejerot to explain the apparently irrational affection that some captives felt for their hostage-takers. The theory reached a wider audience a year later when Californian newspaper heiress Patty Hearst was kidnapped by revolutionary militants. The 19-year-old appeared to develop sympathy for her captors, and joined them in a robbery. She was eventually caught and received a prison sentence. According to her defence lawyer, she had been brainwashed and was suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The art of police hostage negotiation was pioneered in the 1970s by New York cops Frank Bolz and Harvey Schlossberg. The idea came out of the botched rescue at the 1972 Munich Olympics, when 11 Israeli athletes were killed after being taken captive by members of a Palestinian militant group. In 1980, Bolz and Schlossberg featured in the BBC documentary Inside Story: Hostage Cops and explained that the NYPD hostage negotiation team was set up because of fears something similar could happen in the city. Their aim was to safely de-escalate situations instead of going in Hollywood-style with all guns blazing. Delaying tactics gave hostage-takers more time to make errors, and created room to build rapport with their captives, making a violent end less likely. By the end of the 1970s, about 1,500 police forces had sent officers to New York to learn from Bolz's practical experience of more than 200 hostage incidents. These lessons travelled even further when a BBC documentary crew sat in on a masterclass delivered by Bolz and Schlossberg, a former traffic cop with a doctorate in psychology. For Schlossberg, Stockholm Syndrome – or Survival Identification Syndrome – was not a complicated concept.   ""We simply mean when two or more people get together, they form a relationship –  that's all it is,"" he said. ""Of course, the more stress in the situation, the quicker the relationship, and the more intense it's going to be. When people are in crisis, and they're not sure about what's going to happen, the one thing we're all afraid of is going insane. I mean, we're always worried about, are we losing our mind? Is this really happening to me? What am I doing in a thing like that? Am I experiencing this? And what we do is we want to test our feelings against another person, because if that person is sharing this experience and he's seeing the same thing, and he ain't going bananas and this is really happening, maybe it's OK."" Schlossberg said that while criminals would often put hostages on the telephone to speak to negotiators, there was no point trying to obtain secret information from them: ""The hostage will tell the criminal everything you tell him. They make terrible witnesses and when they get released, the intelligence information they give you should be taken for what it's worth."" Bolz said that when hostage-takers made demands it was important not to dismiss them outright. He said: ""You never tell him no, but you don't necessarily tell him yes. It's always, 'Let me see what I can do – let me try for you'."" Schlossberg said it was vital that police kept control of the situation, insisting that the hostage-taker ""will talk to our negotiator or he talks to no one"". ""We don't want lawyers, mothers, priests – we don't want them talking,"" he said. ""The fantasy is, you're going to talk to no one unless you get the person you want to talk to. The reality is, how long could you sit in this room and not make contact with the outside world?"" At the time of the Stockholm siege, none of these lessons was available to Stockholm police, who made a series of rookie errors that would not happen today. When Olsson blasted his way into the Sveriges Kreditbanken, he demanded three million Swedish krona, a getaway car, and another criminal to be delivered to him from jail. While he didn't get the money or the car, psychiatrist Nils Bejerot advised police to acquiesce to his request that Clark Olofsson, one of Sweden's most infamous criminals, be brought to the bank in Stockholm's Norrmalmstorg Square. Olofsson was tasked to work as an inside man in exchange for a reduced sentence.   Bejerot is the man who coined the term Norrmalmstorg Syndrome, later known as Stockholm Syndrome. For some, this theorising was an attempt to deflect attention away from the mistakes made by him and police colleagues during the siege, by instead putting the blame on victims.   Over the course of the siege, the four hostages and two criminals began to develop an unlikely bond inside the bank vault, amid apparent acts of kindness by the captors. In contrast, the captives expressed more hostility towards the police, fearing that any attempt to end the stand-off might end in them being killed. More like this: • The WW1 trauma that inspired Lord of the Rings • Hitchcock reveals the secret to his masterpieces • The provocative 80s rap that became an anthem Hostage Kristin Enmark was persuaded by the charismatic Olofsson to have a telephone conversation with Olof Palme, the actual Swedish prime minister. She begged to be allowed to leave the bank in a getaway car with the kidnappers, telling him: ""I think you are sitting there playing checkers with our lives. I fully trust Clark and the robber. I am not desperate. They haven't done a thing to us. On the contrary, they have been very nice. But you know, Olof, what I'm scared of is that the police will attack and cause us to die."" Looking back in 2016, Enmark told the BBC: ""I wish that that phone call never had happened because it was a meaningless call. I was sitting there asking for my life. He was the prime minister. What could he say?"" For several days, the hostages were held inside a bank vault while surrounded by armed police. Officers eventually decided to break through the ceiling and use tear gas to disarm the kidnappers. Police shouted for the hostages to come out first, but they refused, believing that the captors would be shot. Instead, as the criminals walked out, they stopped in the doorway to embrace two of the female captives. Hostage Säfström, who had earlier narrowly escaped being shot, received a manly handshake. It was behaviour that baffled many of the Swedish public who had for days been gripped by the dramatic events at the bank. While Bejerot diagnosed Stockholm Syndrome without even speaking to Enmark, the theory had the air of a plausible explanation, and it caught the imagination of the international media.

For New York hostage negotiators Frank Bolz and Harvey Schlossberg in 1980, the concept could be seen as a useful teaching aid to describe interpersonal dynamics in a traumatic situation. However, the label is a complete misrepresentation of Kristin's experience, according to Dr Allan Wade, a Canadian therapist who has spoken at length with her. He told BBC Reel in 2023: ""The term Stockholm Syndrome has long roots in psychoanalytic thinking in Europe. But in that moment, it was used to silence and discredit an angry young woman who had been resisting violence, protecting herself and other people for six and a half days. It was used to protect the police response."" Kristin said in 2016 that she remained friends with Oloffson, the man taken from prison to meet the demands of robber Olsson. Dr Wade said that during the siege, the prisoner ""was actually working in a way to try to make some of the people feel safer, and if you treat Clark Olofsson as though he was simply another one of the captors, you would have a very difficult time understanding why Kristin or others might have some sense of a positive recollection of him"". Speaking on the BBC's Sideways podcast in 2021, Kristen had a blunt assessment of Stockholm Syndrome. ""It's bullshit, if you can say that on the BBC. It's a way of blaming the victim. I did what I could to survive."" -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

1516,East v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals,"East v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals ""These are all harmless drugs. All athletes take them. It's really nothing special."" That was what German heptathlete Birgit Dressel, who finished ninth in the 1984 Olympic Games, once told her mother. Sadly, those words couldn't have been further from the truth. On 8 April 1987, after taking medication to help with a bad back, Dressel's body went into allergic-toxic shock, leading to rapid organ failure.  After two days of agony in Mainz hospital, she died at the age of 26. Her autopsy revealed traces of more than 100 drugs in her system, including anabolic steroids that she had been taking for years, while her medical history showed she had been injected with at least 40 different substances throughout her career, with one practitioner alone administering 400 injections. During her final years, she became heavily reliant on prescription drugs to compete and live pain-free. Her tortuous training regime had pushed her body to the brink, and by the time of her death, she was experiencing hip pain, lateral bending of the spinal column, damage to the discs and fusion of the spinal vertebrae, displacement of the pelvis, degeneration of both kneecaps and sunken arches in her feet.  To combat the pain, she was reportedly taking nine pills a day, as well as additional drugs administered by three separate doctors. Dressel's demise was a harrowing example of how far humans will go to keep up, but her story had much broader implications. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, a treasure trove of documents held by the then-defunct East German secret police, the Stasi, revealed what many had suspected for decades: East Germany had conducted a state-sponsored, systematic doping operation that led to spectacular sporting success. As the sordid details were gradually revealed, Western European nations appeared vindicated.  Allegations of East Germany doping, along with other Soviet satellite states, had increased dramatically throughout the 1980s. Here was confirmation the other side had been cheating all along. However, the narrative was not quite so simple. The division between 'clean' and 'dirty' athletes was not as well-defined as the line that had cut Germany in half for nearly 50 years. Dressel, born in Bremen and living in Mainz, was not from East Germany but from the West. While they would take decades to emerge, West German sport had its own secrets. Ines Geipel (far left, bib number 166) competing in 1985. On the far right, in bib number seven, is Marita Koch, another East German athlete whose 39-year-old 400m record still stands today ""From the 1970s onwards, East Germany began winning a lot of medals. West German politicians started worrying about it and spreading the message that West German athletes needed to win medals too,"" says Letizia Paoli, who chaired the 2009 committee investigating West German doping activity at the University of Freiburg. ""They couldn't afford to look worse than the East. Medals were seen as an indicator of political and economic success."" The East German doping system was comprehensive, systematic and all-encompassing. Stasi files revealed that an initially amateurish doping programme was transformed in 1974 by an innocuous-sounding piece of policy called State Research Plan 14.25. It mandated doping across all sports with the potential to deliver Olympic glory. Thousands of athletes, some as young as 12, were shovelled through a programme where cheating was a prerequisite. ""The training regime was really tough. We trained three times a day, and when we weren't training we did physiotherapy, sauna and yoga to recover. We were like well-bred horses waiting to race,"" says Ines Geipel, a former East German athlete and author of a book, Behind The Wall, which details her experience in Cold War East Germany. ""As young people, sport was the only way for us to see the world - to get out. ""We were given various tablets in silver foil, but there was no information about them, just that they were good to take because we sweated so much while competing."" Thanks to recovered documents, Geipel now knows she was primarily being given an anabolic steroid called oral turinabol. Refusals or questioning led to the withdrawal of athletic sponsorship and a black mark against your name in Stasi files. That, in turn, could affect your chances of gaining employment, housing or benefits. Geipel felt the full weight of the Stasi when officials uncovered her plans to defect and remain in Los Angeles after the 1984 Olympics to be with a Mexican athlete she had fallen in love with. After returning to East Germany, the Stasi turned the screw, she was expelled from sport and, for many of her compatriots, became a social pariah. ""If you escaped, you were seen as a traitor,"" said Geipel. ""Firstly, they wanted to find a man in the GDR [East Germany] who looked like the Mexican I'd fallen in love with. ""They thought if I met a man who looked like the Mexican, then everything would be good again. There wasn't such a man. ""Then they tried to force me to commit to the Stasi. But I didn't do it. ""The last stage, when they didn't see any other option, was to operate on me and cut through my stomach. ""It's all in the files... they cut the stomach in such a way, through all the muscles and everything so that I couldn't run any more and didn't have a way of getting to the rest of the world any more."" In August 1989, she fled to the West via Hungary after crawling across the heavily-defended border. Geipel, pictured in 2014, asked for her name to be removed from the German record books after she was part of a quartet who set a national 4x100m record. An asterisk now appears in its place It is possible to pick up the threads of Germany's recent doping past and follow them back decades. Plenty lead to the Western side of the Cold War. The day before the 2006 Tour de France,  a doping scandal exploded. German rider Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour winner and one of that year's favourites, was sitting on a bus on the way to a press conference when he received the news that his world was about to come down around him. Operation Puerto, an investigation by Spanish police into doping in sport, had connected him to illegal blood transfusion.  The investigation's details were scandalous: Manolo Saiz, the directeur sportif of the Liberty Seguros–Wurth team, was arrested with a briefcase of cash in Madrid. The Spaniard was never charged, but neither did he ever return to the top level of professional cycling.  Elsewhere a fridge filled with 186 blood bags, labelled with codenames belonging to athletes, was discovered at doctor Eufemiano Fuentes' clinic, along with complex machines to manipulate and transfuse blood. Investigations into his German-based T Mobile team later uncovered more than a decade's worth of doping starting in the early 1990s, when it was known as Telekom. Ullrich, seen here in the wake of his 2006 suspension from the Tour de France, has said that not blood doping during his era would have been ""like going to a gunfight armed only with a knife"" Two team doctors, Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich, admitted their involvement in long-term doping. ""I made available to cyclists, upon request, drug substances, especially EPO [erythropoietin, a hormone that causes the body to make more red blood cells],"" said Schmid, claiming in his defence that he had never doped an unwitting athlete. Both men came from one university department: the University Medical Center Freiberg, in south west Germany, just 20 miles from the French border. The University of Freiberg responded by forming an independent committee to look into historic doping allegations. The first commission was quickly dissolved due to health reasons, while Paoli, an Italian criminologist, was asked to chair the second and head a six-strong team of investigators. She accepted, but her and her team's relationship with the university soon deteriorated. All six of the investigators resigned in protest at the lack of cooperation from the university and its departments, but ultimately did publish an independent report. It painted a damning picture of decades of doping by medics based at Freiburg. Two men were cited as key players: professors Joseph Keul and Armin Klumper. From the 1960s onwards, Keul, who died in 2000, was the superstar physician in Germany, working with scores of top-level athletes and acting for more than 20 years as head physician of the German Olympic team. Keul started providing medical care for West German Olympic teams in 1960 Klumper joined Freiburg in the mid-1960s, initially as a medical assistant, before becoming head of sports traumatology. ""Unlike in East Germany, where it was a top-down doping system, in the West, much of it was outsourced to Freiburg,"" says Paoli. According to sources seen by the commission, as much as 90% of West German track and field athletes during the 1970s and 1980s passed through Freiburg - though how many doped may never be known. What's clear is that Keul and Klumper played vital roles in West Germany's and then Germany's sporting successes. ""The athletes loved Klumper. He was excellent with his diagnostics and would go to the track and field to spend a lot of time with them, while Keul was more hands-off,"" says Paoli. Evidence of Klumper's involvement in doping is staggering. His infamous 'Klumper cocktails' were referenced multiple times during interviews with ex-athletes. ""These were mixtures of off-label medicines, prescription medicines, doping products and natural remedies that were supposedly tailored to individual athletes' needs,"" says Paoli. One such athlete was Dressel, who visited Klumper regularly for treatment. Her last visit to Freiburg came on the 24 February 1987 - less than three months before her death - where he reportedly gave her a cocktail containing 15 substances. By the late 1980s, numerous West German sporting figures, including discus thrower Alwin Wagner, external and sprinter Manfred Ommer,, external were openly linking Klumper, who died in 2019, with historic doping. Yet he also had his supporters. Even as his name began to sink under further allegations in 1997, a passionate defence was published in a national newspaper, signed by some major names in German sport at the time, including gymnast Eberhard Gienger, decathlete Jurgen Hingsen and footballer Wolfgang Overath. Gienger subsequently admitted in 2006 that he had taken anabolic steroids, external during his career, saying he doped to aid his recovery after an operation and that Klumper ""prescribed very generously"".  Hingsen insisted in 2016 that Klumper and Keul had never offered him anything illicit, external. Overath has since described any suggestion of doping during his time in elite sport as 'absurd'., external Hingsen in discussion with Klumper (right) in the summer of 1988. Hingsen committed three false starts in the 100m - the opening event of the competition - in the Olympic decathlon in Seoul later that year, ending his hopes of a medal Olympic medal-winning hammer thrower Uwe Beyer presented a prescription for steroids bearing Keul's name, but, overall, direct evidence linking Klumper's colleague with doping was less widespread. Keul instead worked to undermine the growing evidence of the health risks of drug misuse and the anti-doping system designed to catch cheats. In 1976, he gave an interview explaining how he justified his stance to himself and others. ""Where is it written that we should prevent harm?"" Keul said to German broadcaster ZDF. ""That is a general medical task, but it has nothing to do with sports medicine."" For him, healthy sportspeople gambling on performance enhancement was a separate branch of medicine, one where the usual considerations did not apply. In 1992, with public funds drying up after the end of the Cold War, Keul began taking large amounts from external sources, including Deutsche Telekom's cycling team, which later became T-Mobile. The narrative of a virtuous West Germany emerging victorious from sport's Cold War was dented when T-Mobile and Keul's Freiburg colleagues were caught up in the Tour de France doping scandal in 2006. In August 2013, it was fatally shattered. Alwin Wagner finished sixth at the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics, but said Armin Klumper stopped doping him after those Games as he continued to criticise and question the drugs regimes that West Germany's elite athletes undertook A report commissioned by the German Ministry of Sport and carried out by researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin and the University of Munster - Leaks from Doping in Germany from 1950 to Today - appeared in various German newspapers. The report was heavily redacted because of legal and privacy concerns, but was clear enough in its claim that doping was widespread on both sides of the Cold War divide and had continued after reunification. The revelations on West German doping landed like a bombshell, with the reverberations travelling around the world. The report alleged that West Germany's shock comeback win over Hungary in the 1954 World Cup final - a game often called 'The Miracle of Bern' - had been powered by pervitin, an energy-boosting methamphetamine. The drug had been studied in depth for its doping qualities at Freiburg during the 1950s. Questions were also raised over West Germany's 1966 World Cup, in which they reached the final but lost to England 4-2. The report revealed that a letter from Fifa official Mihailo Andrejevic informed the president of the German Athletics Association, Max Danz, that ""fine traces"" of ephedrine - a central nervous system stimulant - were found in three players of the German national team.  No action was taken and some have speculated that the players may have consumed the ephedrine in a cold medicine. By the time of the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, in Munich and Montreal respectively, organised doping was common among West Germany's elite athletes, the report added. While most of Germany's sports federations agreed to take part and share documentation, according to the report, it was notable that the country's athletic association refused to hand over the minutes of its presidential meetings, while ""a former president of the federation was unwilling to allow access to doping-related documents in his possession"". The report also states that the German Football Association only offered the researchers access under ultimately unacceptable conditions, while the security services refused access to potential doping-related documents from both West and East Germany. Over a decade later, the initial report, even with redactions, is only available as a physical copy by request to the German government.  The Federal Institute for Sports Science (BISp) said the 804-page initial report did not ""meet the requirements of good scientific work in form and content"" and requested that it was revised. A later, 43-page version has been made available more publicly., external The University of Freiberg told BBC Sport that it is ""committed to the consistent, unreserved and transparent clarification of the past surrounding Freiburg sports medicine"" and described the resignation of Paoli and her team of investigators and their failure to deliver a final report in conjunction with it as ""very regrettable"". The university has made some parts of the team's provisional work available online., external Germany announced in July, external that it intends to bid to host the 2040 Olympic and Paralympic Games. If successful, the event would mark 50 years since reunification. But, like the future, the country's past is contested. The Cold War had its victor, and victors often have the freedom to mould history and storylines as they see fit. Yet West Germany's secrets have, at least partially, emerged to change the script. East Germany doped its athletes on a chillingly industrial level that saw thousands drugged without clear consent to gain a sporting upper hand - but the situation in the West was far less opaque. Those in West Germany were afforded freedom beyond the wildest dreams of East Germans, but it's becoming increasingly clear that many chose exactly the same methods as the enemy.  For some, in the battle for Cold War medals, anything to gain an advantage was fair game.

1524,Key moments when Harris and Obama's political paths crossed,"Former President Barack Obama will return to the Democratic National Convention stage in his hometown of Chicago to deliver the keynote address on Tuesday, 20 years after his convention debut thrust him into the national spotlight. It’s a tricky moment for one of the party’s most popular figures. He will use his speech to touch on the historic nature of Kamala Harris’s candidacy – the first female of colour to lead the ticket – as a continuation of his legacy. But he must also pay tribute to his own vice-president and the man responsible for her rise – President Joe Biden. Mr Obama, 63, and Ms Harris, 59, have moved in overlapping political orbits as early as his days as an Illinois state senator running for the US Senate. The two, both on the rise in their nascent political careers, met at a California fundraiser in 2004.  As an early supporter, Ms Harris would later volunteer for his presidential campaign and help power his first victory in 2008. Buoyed by party enthusiasm for Ms Harris’s campaign, Mr Obama - and his popular wife Michelle Obama - will try to return the favour and help propel her to the Oval Office. “I think he can excite people about her and about the stakes [of the election] and I think that’s what he intends to do today,” David Plouffe, Mr Obama’s 2008 campaign manager and a now Harris campaign adviser, told Axios. Here’s a look at key moments in their two-decade relationship. Ms Harris, then a San Francisco district attorney, was in the crowd of more than 15,000 people as then-junior senator announced his longshot bid for the White House on the steps of the Old State Capitol in the Illinois capital city of Springfield in February 2007. She would go on to knock on doors and raise money for Mr Obama ahead of the Iowa caucuses in 2008, later serving as his California campaign co-chair. Mr Obama lent her some of his national star power two years later when she mounted a statewide bid for attorney general against Republican Steve Cooley, a popular Los Angeles district attorney. She had been affectionately referred to as “the female Barack Obama” by longtime PBS News anchor Gwen Ifill, but remained locked in a tight contest. Mr Obama, who would endure widespread congressional losses in that election year, made time to appear at a Los Angeles rally in October 2010 in which he referred to Ms Harris as “dear, dear friend of mine”. “I want everybody to do right by her,” he told the crowd. Ms Harris eked out a victory by less than a percentage point, setting her on a path toward higher office. Mr Obama gave Ms Harris a coveted speaking role at the 2012 Democratic National Convention for his re-election. She had already made a name for herself in California in barrier-breaking roles as the first person of colour or woman to serve as San Francisco's district attorney. She was also the first African American and South Asian American elected as the state's top lawyer. But as attorney general, she had made headlines for standing firm in negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and the banks responsible for the foreclosure crisis, securing more than $25 billion on behalf of homeowners. She spoke of her accomplishment, weaving in her personal story, praising Mr Obama for standing up for Americans during the housing crisis and attacking his Republican challenger Mitt Romney as an ally of Wall Street. ""We need to move forward."" she said in her speech, a phrase she has reprised in her 2024 campaign. ""President Obama will fight for working families. He will fight to level the economic playing field and fight to give every American the same fair shot my family had."" Her high-profile remarks came just before former President Bill Clinton, landing a spot that was guaranteed to catch the attention of national Democrats, powerbrokers and key donors.  Though Mr Obama quietly supported Ms Harris as she rose through California politics, he raised eyebrows in 2013 when he referred to her as ""the best looking attorney general in the country"". “You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you’d want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,” the president said at a San Francisco fundraiser. “She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country.” He phoned Ms Harris hours later to apologise for the comment.  ""They are old friends and good friends and he did not want in any way to diminish"" her accomplishments, White House spokesman Jay Carney later told reporters. At the height of his Democratic power in 2016, finishing his second term as president, Mr Obama waded into the contentious California Senate race to endorse Ms Harris, who launched a bid to replace retiring Senator Barbara Boxer. In July of that year, he and Vice-President Joe Biden formally announced their support for Ms Harris, who was running against fellow Democrat and US Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez. In California's primary system, the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party.  ""Kamala is a lifelong courtroom prosecutor with only one client: the people of the State of California. That’s the approach she’ll take to the United States Senate,"" Mr Obama said in a statement released by the Harris campaign.  Mr Biden said he had known her through his son Beau Biden, who forged a friendship with Ms Harris as Delaware's attorney general during their mortgage settlement negotiations.  Ms Harris handily won the election, and became only the second black female to serve in the US Senate. Ms Harris' 2020 presidential primary bid began as a spectacle, launched in her hometown of Oakland, California, before a crowd of 20,000 people in 2019. Like others in the crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, she met with Mr Obama to lay out her case for her candidacy.  But Mr Obama, whose own vice-president was mounting an election bid, wanted to stay out of the political fray and wait until the party selected its nominee before offering his coveted endorsement.  Ms Harris's campaign collapsed in less than a year, and Joe Biden would offer her a political reprieve as his running mate. Mr Obama reportedly supported Mr Biden's selection of Ms Harris, despite their early debate clash over the former vice-president's record on school desegregation. Mr Obama said his former vice-president ""nailed this decision"" in selecting Ms Harris.  ""Choosing a vice-president is the first important decision a president makes. When you're in the Oval Office, weighing the toughest issues, and the choice you make will affect the lives and livelihoods of the entire country — you need someone with you who's got the judgement and the character to make the right call,"" Mr Obama said in a statement at the time.  Since 2020, Mr Obama has been in regular touch with Ms Harris, providing counsel and serving as a sounding board whenever she's asked.  The Obamas waited several days to endorse Ms Harris until it was clear that there were no challengers and she was the party's choice. The couple released a video of them calling her to formally announce their support for her campaign. “We’ve known each other for 20 years. I’ve watched how you have excelled in every position you’ve been in,” Mr Obama told her in the phone call. “Just to see all that hard work be recognised is something that we couldn’t be more thrilled about. And so the main thing we wanted to do was just let you know and let Doug [Emhoff] know, our soon-to-be first gentleman, that we are gonna do everything we can to help propel you into the presidency.” Over the last few months, the two have been in close contact as Mr Obama has sought to offer support for her campaign, including policy or strategic advice, fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. Ms Harris has also relied on many of Mr Obama’s old hands to help run her campaign. Eric Holder, who served as Mr Obama’s attorney general, led efforts to vet Ms Harris’s shortlist for vice-president, while Mr Plouffe is now serving as one of her most senior advisers.  The Harris campaign has also enlisted other Obama aides including Jennifer O’Malley Dillion, her campaign chairwoman, and senior adviser Stephanie Cutter. Former Obama communications director Jennifer Palmieri is also helping Ms Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff.",2024-08-20 23:11:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj08mn24jplo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1539,Hulk Hogan jokes about body slamming Kamala Harris,"Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has joked about body slamming Vice-President Kamala Harris in front of a fired up crowd, and questioned her racial identity. In a video obtained by TMZ, the 71-year-old can be seen asking the jeering crowd: ""Do you want me to body slam Kamala Harris?!"" ""Do you want me to drop the leg on Kamala?!"" he shouts, referring to one of his iconic wrestling moves. The comments were made during a promotional event for his new beer, and come amid calls to stop violent political rhetoric, following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump nearly six weeks ago. Hogan continued to make more comments about Ms Harris including one about her Indian heritage. Kamala Harris is bi-racial - her mother was from India and her father is Jamaican.  ""Is Kamala a chameleon? Is she Indian?"" Hogan asked the crowd, before using an outdated and stereotypical greeting associated with Native American Indians.  The video stops after he could be heard saying he ""was going to get heat for that one"". ""That was not me, that was the beer talking,"" he added. The BBC has contacted Hulk Hogan's management for comment. Trump recently attacked the vice-president's racial identity, falsely claiming she had only ever emphasised her Asian-American heritage until recently when, he claimed, ""she became a black person"". Last month, Hulk Hogan appeared at the Republican National Convention where he gave a speech praising Trump. He also ripped off a shirt to reveal a vest with Trump's name and his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance. The former wrestler's latest comments come as the Democrats are holding their party's convention this week in Chicago, where they will formally endorse Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate for November's election.

1536,Here’s who’s speaking on day 2 of the Democratic Convention,"With just three months to go before the 2024 election, thousands of people have gathered in Chicago this week for the Democratic National Convention. This year’s event is at the United Center Arena and started Monday 19 August, continuing through Thursday. The convention, which happens every four years before a presidential election,  looks slightly different from those in the past. The party already has officially nominated Vice-President Kamala Harris in a virtual roll call after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. But many of the other DNC traditions - including appearances from celebrities and memorable speeches from party leaders - will remain the same. US conventons date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered in Baltimore to nominate him for a second term. Here’s what to know. On Tuesday, former President Barack Obama is expected to deliver a prime-time speech at around 21:00 local time (03:00 BST). Former First Lady Michelle Obama will also speak.  The evening will also feature several prominent senators on the convention stage: Majority Leader Chuck Schumer; Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth.  Other key speakers include Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Mesa, Arizona Mayor John Giles and Ms Harris’s husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. After the convention experienced a number of delays on Monday, DNC organisers said that the programme would begin earlier, at approximately 17:30 local time. Wednesday’s line-up reportedly features former President Bill Clinton and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, among others. Ms Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will give the prime-time speech that night after his nomination. The most important night of the convention is Thursday, when Vice-President Harris will take the stage. She will formally accept the presidential nomination and give her speech on the final night of the convention dedicated ""For the Future"". House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will also take the stage at some point during the week.   Several prominent Democrats and celebrities took the stage on the first night in Chicago. The convention heard from President Joe Biden, who was the headline speaker on Monday. He was introduced by his wife Jill and daughter Ashley. During an emotional defence of his presidency, he said: ""America, I gave my best to you."" 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered her own tribute to Mr Biden the same evening, and voiced her hope that Kamala Harris could finally break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US by becoming the first female president. Others who spoke on Monday included progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Americans affected by abortion bans in Republican-controlled states, and voices from the labour movement, including United Auto Workers head Shawn Fain. Because Ms Harris and Mr Walz have already been nominated, this year's convention will focus on speeches from prominent Democrats and the adoption of the party’s platform. Delegates work during the day to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence.  In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it. Members of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there will be plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself will offer live-streams on social media platforms. You'll be able to follow BBC News coverage - featuring on-site reporting and analysis - across the website and app, and on our live-stream.  The BBC News Channel will carry special coverage from 20:00 ET (01:00 BST) each night. You can find special episodes of The Global Story and Americast podcasts on BBC Sounds and other podcast platforms. Sign up to North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's election newsletter US Election Unspun for his take on the week's events direct to your inbox.  Around 50,000 people are expected at this year's convention in Chicago. This includes thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties as well as super delegates, who are major elected officials, notable members of the Democratic Party and some members of the Democratic National Committee. Thousands of members of the media will also be in attendance. It will be a star-studded convention with appearances from several celebrities. In 2020, actors Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Eva Longoria attended the convention, while Elizabeth Banks and America Ferrera appeared in 2016. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will attend this year, but neither has confirmed. Demonstrations outside the DNC venue centre around opposition to US support of Israel’s war in Gaza.  Thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest on Monday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. Several were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence. The turnout appeared to be well below the tens of thousands that organisers had hoped for and short of the 15,000 they claimed were there. In that night's address, Mr Biden acknowledged that the activists ""have a point"", going on to say that ""a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides"".",2024-08-20 23:11:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ey324neeo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1527,Five takeaways from the Democratic Convention's first night,"The Democratic National Convention’s first night featured an unusual send off, as it came just a month after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his former running mate - Kamala Harris. Ms Harris broke with tradition and spoke at the start of the convention to voice her gratitude for her boss. ""I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden,"" she said. The evening showcased a range of speakers, from Olympic gold medal-winning basketball coach Steve Kerr to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But Mr Biden gave the prime-time address. He praised Ms Harris's leadership and promising that America's best days were ""before us.""  Here is a look back at the night's most memorable moments. Only four weeks ago, President Biden had every intention of closing the Democratic convention and watching a slate of speakers spend this week praising his administration.  But after a wild month for US politics, Biden instead spoke as a surrogate for his former running mate - a job he fulfilled at Chicago's United Center on the opening night of the convention.  Despite the change of fortune, Mr Biden was greeted by minutes of uninterrupted applause from a crowd of thousands. They chanted “Thank you Joe!” for his time in office and for his decision to pass the torch to Ms Harris. The loud and lasting cheers brought tears to Mr Biden’s eyes, after he hugged daughter Ashley Biden, who introduced him to the convention. He then gave a 50-minute speech, touting his administration's accomplishments and speaking about the threat that Republican nominee Donald Trump poses.  This speech could be one of the last the president gives in front of a crowd that size and with cheers that thunderous. The loudest applause line came near the end when he told the audience: ""America, America, I gave my best to you."" While the first night of the DNC featured some of the Democratic Party’s most seasoned leaders, including Mr Biden and Ms Clinton, much of the programme was dedicated to ushering in a new generation of Democrats. Several of the party’s rising stars were featured throughout the evening, including Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Monday appeared to serve as a means to pass the political torch from one generation to another and heal any perceived wounds that occurred over a difficult month for Democrats.  Several of the lawmakers who took the stage on Monday - including Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Delaware Senator Chris Coons - had advocated for Mr Biden to stay in the race just a few weeks ago.  But each one spoke about being all in for Ms Harris.  “Kamala Harris is for the middle class because she is from the middle class,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez told the convention in her first major party convention speech. Others who worked to push out Mr Biden from the presidential race - such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - cheered him on during his speech.  Thousands of demonstrators gathered in Chicago on Monday to protest the Biden administration’s support of Israel’s war in Gaza, but the issue received little mention during the first night of speeches at the DNC. While pro-Palestinian organisers saw smaller numbers than the “tens of thousands” they orginially expected, the demonstration outside the United Center proved to be energetic enough to break through a security barricade - leading to 13 arrests.  The demonstrators received one brief acknowledgement from Mr Biden during his speech on Monday night. He said that the Chicago protestors “have a point”, though he added that many innocent people were killed “on both sides”. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israel’s war in Gaza has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, while about 1,200 Israelis have been killed, according to their government. There are additional protests planned for the rest of the week at the DNC. Asked whether any Palestinians would be able to voice their concerns on the convention stage, a Harris campaign spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday that they did not have any scheduling updates. Labour was a prominent theme on Monday night - even Mr Biden labelled himself the most pro-labour president in American history.  But perhaps one of the most memorable lines of the night came from United Automobile Workers President Shawn Fain, who took the podium and called Trump a “scab” - someone who undermines organised workers. The insult - which was also featured on Mr Fain’s shirt - was met with an eruption of applause from the audience. Mr Fain was just one of several labour leaders to pledge support for Ms Harris at the DNC on Monday. Others included AFL-CIO President Elizabeth Shuler - a major union leader - and Brent Booker, the president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. Missing from the stage was Teamsters President Sean O'Brien, who gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. After much backlash, the Teamsters president requested a speaking slot at the DNC - but he did not obtain one.  In a speech that echoed remarks she gave at her own DNC nomination just eight years ago, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the crowd Ms Harris would be the first to break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US. Ms Clinton made her own unsuccessful run to become America’s first female president in 2016, losing to Trump in an election that shocked many. But, taking the stage once again at the DNC on Monday night, the longtime Democratic politician stressed her belief that Ms Harris would have a better outcome.  “On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th President of the United States.” Ms Clinton - who is reportedly a close adviser of Ms Harris - said her defeat in 2016 inspired millions of women to march, run for office and keep “our eyes on the future of America”. To loud applauses from the crowd, she repeated a line from her 2016 speech almost word for word: “When a barrier falls for one of us, it clears the way for all of us.""",2024-08-20 23:11:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dp6veej7do,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1531,Doug Emhoff could be the first US First Gentleman,"When Kamala Harris found out President Joe Biden was stepping aside in the 2024 presidential race, she immediately called her husband.  But Doug Emhoff was busy - 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away taking a cycling class with friends in Los Angeles.  He has recounted the story a handful of times on the campaign trail in the weeks since Vice-President Harris became the Democratic nominee for president.  The second-gentleman said when his friends showed him the news on their phones, he ran to his car to grab his phone, which was ""on fire"".  When he called his wife back, she picked up and said, ""where the ... were you, I need you,"" Mr Emhoff, 59, recounted.    The pair have had a genial public relationship, so it is not a surprise Mr Emhoff, a former Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, shared the personal and relatable moment.  Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff met in 2013 after being set up on a blind date.  ""I'm too old to play games or hide the ball"", Mr Emhoff said at the time, Ms Harris wrote in her 2013 memoir, The Truths We Hold. ""I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work."" They married less than a year later in a ceremony that paid tribute to his Jewish faith and her Indian heritage.  These days - at campaign stops and in television interviews - Ms Harris can be heard affectionately referring to her husband as “Dougie,” or “My Dougie"".  Through the marriage, Ms Harris became a step-mother or ""Momala,"" as she is also known, to Mr Emhoff's children from his first marriage, Cole and Ella.  He has his children's initials tattooed on his left wrist: ""I just really wanted a reminder of what's important to me,"" he said in an interview pointing to the tattoo. ""I wanted a visceral reminder of them.""  Born in Brooklyn, New York, Mr Emhoff spent his youth in New Jersey, and fulfilled his dream of becoming an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles - something he did for 30 years. Since then, Mr Emhoff has been there through his wife's 2016 Senate run, her 2019 primary campaign for president and the 2020 race - which she won, making history as the first black and South Asian women to become vice-president. Mr Emhoff was a largely unknown figure when she was sworn in, but has taken a more public role since he became the nation's first second-gentleman. He gave up his entertainment law career and began teaching at Georgetown Law School when he relocated to Washington DC.   Mr Emhoff has used his new platform to advocate for reproductive rights and at recent campaign stops has discussed restrictions on abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.   But it's been Mr Emhoff's role as the face of the administration's fight against a global rise in antisemitism where he's found the biggest spotlight.  As the first Jewish spouse of a White House principal, he traveled to the former site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland and marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day in Germany in 2023. “People used to be afraid to say the ugly epithets and lies out loud,"" Mr Emhoff said during remarks at the former concentration camp. ""Now, they are literally screaming them. We are witnessing an epidemic of hate in the United States and internationally."" He spoke out against antisemitism when protests over the war in Gaza sprang up on US university campuses this year.  In the weeks since Ms Harris became the party's presidential nominee, Mr Emhoff has been traveling more, making campaign appearances on behalf of his wife and her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.  Mr Emhoff travelled to Paris earlier this month to lead a US delegation to the Paris Olympics closing ceremonies, taking first lady Jill Biden's place.  But Mr Emhoff also faced new criticism as his wife has faced more scrutiny on the top of the ticket.  Earlier this month, reports surfaced about an extramarital affair Mr Emhoff had in his previous marriage.  ""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” he said in a statement, appearing to acknowledge the report. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.” The team that vetted Mr Emhoff before Ms Harris was chosen as President Joe Biden's running mate knew of his previous affair, a source familiar with the process told the BBC. The affair was also known to Ms Harris before the pair married, according to the source.  Mr Emhoff is expected to make a primetime debut when he speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.",2024-08-20 23:11:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n13ne0d5o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1528,Convention spotlight shines on Biden – with speech he never wanted to give,"It was not the speech Joe Biden wanted to give. At least, not this year, under these circumstances. But if anyone knows how quickly fortunes can change, it’s this president – whose personal and professional life has been scarred by tragedy and adversity. Speaking to a packed arena in Chicago on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Mr Biden offered a full-throated defence of his presidency – touching on many of the themes that he campaigned on in 2020 and again this year before abandoning his re-election bid in mid-July, a few weeks after a catastrophic debate performance. ""Like many of you, I gave my heart and soul to this nation,” he said, towards the end of a nearly hour-long address punctuated by raucous shouts of ""Thank you, Joe"". Mr Biden had walked out onto the stage after being introduced by his daughter Ashley and wife, Jill, who told the audience she ""saw him dig deep into his soul"" when he decided to exit the presidential race. After hugging Ashley, he put a tissue to his eyes to dab away the tears. The president touched his heart, and stood a little straighter at the lectern, flashing a toothy smile as the crowd continued to cheer. His speech had a keen eye on his place in history but he spent time singing the praises of his vice-president - the woman he hopes will succeed him in the White House. “Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee and it's the best decision I made my whole career,” he said. “She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity.” Unlike his Oval Office address four weeks ago, Mr Biden did not speak directly of passing the torch to a new generation - but the message was clear enough. After the president concluded his remarks, Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff came out to embrace Mr Biden and his wife, Jill. “I love you,” the vice-president mouthed to Mr Biden after their hug. While Mr Biden spent much of the end of his speech focusing on Ms Harris – a tacit acknowledgment that how she fares against Donald Trump in November's vote could make or break how history, and his party, remembers him - many of the evening’s earlier speakers directed their tributes to the current White House resident. It started with a planned – but unannounced – appearance by Ms Harris herself, who took the stage to thunderous applause. “Joe, thank you for your historic leadership and for your lifetime of service to our nation and for all you continue to do,” she said. “We are forever grateful to you.”  Later, Delaware Senator Chris Coons – one of Mr Biden’s closest allies – took his turn singing the president’s praises. “I’ve never known a more compassionate man than Joe Biden,” he said. “I’ve never known a man who has taken from his own loss and his own faith and delivered so much for the future of so many others.” Hillary Clinton offered her own tribute when she appeared on stage earlier in the evening, telling the crowd that Mr Biden had ""brought dignity, decency and competence back to the White House"". The 2016 Democratic nominee received an extended ovation, and she noted that while she did not break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” by becoming the first woman president, “on the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office”. The reception Mr Biden received from the packed Democratic convention hall was equally electric. The Democrats here in Chicago have been jubilant all day. But the cheers for the president could be as much a sign of gratitude for his grudging decision to step aside as it was a tribute to a storied political career that began in 1972 when he was first elected to Congress at the age of 29. Tomorrow, Barack Obama will address the convention crowd. On Wednesday, Bill Clinton will have his turn. Both are former presidents who stood for – and won – re-election. Mr Biden will not have that opportunity. Instead, he was left to define and defend his legacy as a one-term president in a speech that, barring a major national event in the next five months, will be his final address to a massive American television audience. Toward the end of the speech, he quoted a line from a song, American Anthem. “Let me know in my heart when my days are through, that America, America, I gave my best to you,” he said. The crowd erupted in another round of applause. Eight years ago, Mr Biden passed up a presidential bid in favour of Mrs Clinton – under some not so subtle pressure from Mr Obama. Four years ago, he won the nomination, but the Covid pandemic denied him an opportunity to bask in adulation of a packed Democratic convention hall and the celebratory post-speech balloon drop. This, then, was as close to a Democratic convention moment in the spotlight Mr Biden will get. After his speech concluded – past midnight on the US east coast - the president left the arena and headed to Air Force One for a flight to California for a holiday. His time in Chicago, at this Democratic National Convention, was measured in hours, not days. And despite his desires just a few months ago, his remaining time as president will be measured in months, not years.

1550,Panama starts returning migrants on US-funded flights,"Panama on Tuesday started repatriating undocumented migrants on flights financed by the United States.  The move comes less than two months after José Raúl Mulino was sworn in as Panama's president. Mr Mulino campaigned on a promise to ""close"" the Darién Gap, the dangerous stretch of jungle which more than half a million migrants crossed last year on their way north from South America. The Biden administration said it had agreed to pay for the flights as part of its efforts to deter irregular migration. A group of 29 Colombians with criminal records were the first to be returned on Tuesday. Under an agreement jointly signed by the Panamanian foreign minister and US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the US has committed to helping Panama with $6m (£4.6m) for equipment, transportation and logistics to ""remove foreign nationals who do not have a legal basis to remain in Panama"". Immigration is a hot topic ahead of November's presidential election in the US and the stream of migrants arriving at its border with Mexico is being closely monitored. The agreement with Panama aims to drive down the number of people making it to the US border by stopping them further south. The Darién Gap, an expanse of jungle which straddles Colombia and Panama, is a natural bottleneck for those heading from South to North America.  In 2023, an estimated 520,000 people made the perilous journey on foot, many of whom had to pay gangs who prey on those embarking on the crossing.  President Mulino, who has promised to reduce the number of migrants transiting through Panama, described their situation as ""sad"". ""Most of them are from Venezuela,"" he explained. ""They're human beings... there are families torn apart, children of five or six years of age whose parents have died during the crossing. We don't even know who they are or what their names are.""  The president had earlier said that the flights would in the first instance take migrants to Colombia, the country from which they entered Panama. It is not yet clear if flights will be organised from Colombia to repatriate them to their homelands.  According to Panamanian government figures, Venezuelans form the largest share of migrants trekking through the Darién Gap, followed by Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Haitians.  There is widespread concern in the region that the flow of those fleeing Venezuela could increase in the months to come if the political crisis triggered by the announcement of disputed election results is not solved.  Ahead of the election, polls had suggested that large numbers of Venezuelans were planning on migrating should President Nicolás Maduro win. Tension has been high since he was declared the winner by the government-dominated National Electoral Council, with the result being rejected as fraudulent by the opposition and questioned by the US, the EU and many Latin American countries. Panamanian President Mulino earlier this month offered Mr Maduro ""safe passage"" so that the Venezuelan leader could leave to a third country, but his offer was rejected by Mr Maduro, who warned his Panamanian counterpart not to ""mess"" with Venezuela.

1556,Three things the Democrats have avoided so far at the DNC,"Modern political conventions tend to be slickly produced, carefully stage-managed events. And despite its struggles with staying on schedule and the unusual way its presidential nominee was chosen, this year’s Democratic gathering in Chicago has been no different. The Democrats on the convention stage have tried to put their best foot forward by talking about Kamala Harris’s qualifications and character, her plan for the economy and issues on which the party has broad public support, like abortion rights and healthcare. But what they don’t talk about – the issues and areas they have largely tried to avoid, at least so far – says as much about their electoral strategies and weakness as what they choose to highlight. Here are three notable omissions halfway through the party extravaganza. Four years ago, amidst the mass protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, the Democratic Party – and the nation as a whole – engaged in a sometimes animated debate about institutional racism and how American history is presented. While many mainstream Democrats avoided the aggressive calls to “defund the police”, most engaged in the discussion of how America could take steps to address what they viewed as the corrosive legacy of slavery in the nation’s businesses, classrooms and government, including by promoting DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion. More recently, the issue of transgender rights has been an animating force among segments of the Democratic coalition – particularly in the face of Republican efforts to limit or prohibit the ability of children to receive gender care. Neither topic has received much attention in the Democratic convention arena so far. There was an emotional tribute to the civil rights movement early on Monday that culminated in a wheelchair-bound Jesse Jackson – who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s – taking the stage. But DEI and other remedies have received short shrift. “DEI has become a dog-whistle code” used to undermine minorities in powerful positions, said Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president of the National Council of Negro Women, which is organising voter outreach efforts in presidential battleground states. “Our country was founded on opportunities for all men and all women, but we're not hearing that now, because a lot of people don't want to alienate a certain base of folk that are afraid of this.” At this convention, alienating the fewest number of potential voters has been the name of the game. And while abortion rights have been a daily focus at the convention, transgender issues – the other hot-button social topic currently - have been largely ignored in the programming that makes national television. Ms Arline-Bradley warns that by not talking about questions of equity and inclusion, the problems will linger. “We should talk about them, because this party is the most inclusive and diverse party,” she said. “Show it, activate it and live by those values.” The last Democratic convention in 2020 was largely virtual – conducted in empty halls and television studios - due to the Covid pandemic. In 2016, when thousands of Democrats gathered in Philadelphia, the rifts within the party were on full display. Supporters of Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, who finished second behind Hillary Clinton for that year’s nomination, repeatedly disrupted the proceedings and organised protests around the convention hall. The party was divided on topics like universal healthcare, free college tuition and, more broadly, whether Democrats should rely on support from deep-pocketed donors, big business and what Mr Sanders labelled the “corporate oligarchy”. Those divisions still exist. Mr Sanders gave a speech Tuesday night railing against the corrupting influence of money in politics. But his speech was immediately followed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who bragged about being a billionaire, and venture capitalist and former American Express chief executive Ken Chenault. The big tent, at least for now, covered obvious differences of policy and opinion. Another current area of sharp divide within the party is US military support for Israel amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. Thousands of protesters have demonstrated outside the convention’s security perimeter, but the intense disagreements have received little attention inside the convention hall. Mr Sanders received applause when he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and Joe Biden turned some heads when he said in his speech on Monday that protesters “have a point” when they say there have been too many civilian deaths. But all this is a far cry from 2016, when some antiwar convention attendees booed former four-star General John Allen and former Secretary of Defence and CIA Director Leon Panetta during their speeches. Ever since undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border surged early in the Biden presidency, the subject of immigration has been a liability for Democrats. Republicans have blamed the administration’s policies for encouraging the historic rise in border incursions, and the flood of new arrivals – many of whom have been transported by conservative governors to populous Democratic cities – has strained public services. The Harris campaign appears to recognise her vulnerability on the issue. One of its first television adverts blamed Donald Trump for sinking bipartisan border-security legislation earlier this year and touted Ms Harris’s record prosecuting “transnational gangs, the drug cartels and the human traffickers” while she was California’s attorney general. But immigration appears to be an issue the Harris team would rather talk about in 50-second television adverts than from the stage in Chicago. The topic has got a few lines here and there, but compared to the 2020 convention – when Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration was a primary focus of attack – the silence has been conspicuous. Reports suggest this could change on Wednesday night, with some speakers due to address the issue.",2024-08-21 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkmzr22y14o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1562,"He's Kamala Harris's running mate. To his students, he's Mr Walz","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz could be America's next vice-president. Nobody is more enthusiastic about it than former students in his small-town, midwest classroom. At Mankato West High School, years before he joined the political scene, a young Mr Walz taught geography and social studies, supervised the lunchroom and coached the football team. The Harris campaign has sought to highlight Mr Walz's career as a teacher, even though he served six terms in Congress before he returned to Minnesota to run for governor, a position he's held since 2018.  Those who knew him back then told the BBC that his teaching history is a guide to the politician he has become and the vice-president he could be.  It was 1999 and Jacob Reitan - the first openly gay student at Mankato West - was part of an effort to form the first gay-straight alliance at the school. GSAs, student-run organisations focused on supporting LGBTQ youth, emerged across the country through the nineties. Mr Reitan still remembers the bullying he faced back then, from the homophobic insult spray-painted on his driveway to a smashed-in car window in the school parking lot. But he told the BBC the Walzes promoted inclusion, kindness and ""jointly made the school a place where it was safe to come out"". And because the new GSA required a faculty advisor, Coach Walz stepped up. ""It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married,"" he said in a 2018 interview, explaining why he took the role. Mr Walz remained a firm supporter of same-sex rights and, in 2011, Mr Reitan stood by the then-congressman's side as President Barack Obama signed his bill repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for gay and lesbian Americans serving in the military into law. ""He's so perfect as an addition to the Harris ticket,"" Mr Reitan said. Introducing him on Tuesday at their first joint campaign event, Ms Harris lavished more praise on Coach Walz than on Governor Walz, his current title. ""Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having, and that every kid deserves,"" she said. ""He's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice-president he will be."" The Trump campaign has assailed Mr Walz as ""a dangerously liberal extremist"" who, along with Ms Harris, forms a ticket that they say is too far left for most Americans to stomach. They have scrutinised his record as Minnesota's governor - from enacting an ambitious left-wing agenda to delaying deployment of the National Guard in response to violent protests following the murder of George Floyd. The Harris campaign is leaning into a biography they believe can win over the rural and working-class voters she needs to defeat Mr Trump this November. While Ms Harris grew up and built her career in liberal California, Mr Walz spent his childhood fishing, farming and hunting in rural Nebraska and came to politics later in life. He joined the National Guard at age 17. For about 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he worked in public high schools - first for a year in China, then in Nebraska and later in his wife's native Minnesota. And former students like Mr Reitan are glowing in their praise for the ex-educator. For brothers Jake and Josh Jagdfeld, attending Mankato West was akin to ""home-schooling with the Walzes"". Josh Jagdfeld took classes with both Tim and Gwen Walz in the 10th grade, and he remembers worrying politics would change his favourite teacher. But when they met on Monday night, Mr Walz greeted him with a shout of ""Mankato West in the building!"" and a big hug. ""He's warm, engaging, cares about everybody he talks to. That's exactly the same Tim Walz I knew,"" Josh Jagdfeld told the BBC. Coach Walz, a defensive coordinator for the school's football team, tapped Jake Jagdfeld as line-backer, putting him ""in a position to succeed"". When Coach Walz joined the team, Mankato West was reeling from a winless 0-27 season. Three years later, it won its first ever state championship. ""Great credit goes to him,"" Jake Jagdfeld said. ""He helped to create an inspirational environment for us young men to feel confident and work hard."" In 2004, Noah Hobbs was in Mr Walz's last geography class before he left teaching. ""He's a very high-energy person, whether school was just starting or it was the end of the day, and that energy was infectious,"" he said. ""The level of care that he gave to all students - not just the kids getting 4.0 [GPAs] - was really impactful for me as a young kid."" Mr Hobbs believes the US is ""looking for someone that is authentic, and Tim embodies that in a way not seen in politics at that level very often"". Mr Walz's evolution from teacher to politician has been described as accidental. In his telling, it stemmed from an incident at then-President George W Bush's 2004 campaign rally in Mankato. He and another teacher chaperoned two students to the event but local organisers refused to let them in. ""They knew we were Democrats,"" Matt Klaber, one of the students, told the BBC. ""At this time, the Bush campaign was turning away any possible protesters from their rallies and this was no exception."" When Mr Klaber pulled out his ID, the staffers observed a faded John Kerry sticker on his wallet. The students were sent home. Mr Walz has described being ""struck by how deeply divided our country was becoming"". He went on to volunteer for the Kerry campaign, develop his own local contacts and then launched a bid for Congress in 2006. ""The news reports say part of what Kamala was looking for was chemistry and a governing partner,"" said Mr Klaber. ""Then picking Mr Walz was a no-brainer. All the good things people have been saying about him as a person are absolutely true."" When Mr Walz arrived on Capitol Hill, new members of Congress were learning in orientation sessions about their salary and benefits. ""They were talking about, ‘I know most of you are taking pay cuts,’” he told local Minnesota television station KSTP. “And I leaned to my aide and said, ‘This is four times what I’ve ever made in my life.’",2024-08-21 23:10:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5rr0rgg3lo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

1564,Day three of Democratic Convention features party's rising stars,"With just three months to go before the 2024 election, thousands of people have gathered in Chicago this week to support Vice-President Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention. After the first two days of the party's celebration, Democrats are gathering at the United Center Arena on Wednesday to hear from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the party's nominee for vice-president. The evening will feature a full slate of prominent Democrats, including rising stars Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  The convention started off on Monday with prime-time remarks from President Joe Biden - an emotional speech that was frequently interrupted by thunderous applause and chants of ""Thank you Joe"". Tuesday brought the ceremonial roll call vote in which state delegations declared their support for the Harris-Walz ticket, and the evening closed with rousing speeches from Barack and Michelle Obama.  The party has already officially nominated Vice-President Harris as its candidate after President Biden dropped out of the race. The in-person roll call on Tuesday was a formality, with performances from celebrities including rapper Lil Jon. US political conventions, which happens every four years before a presidential election, date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered in Baltimore to nominate him for a second term. Here’s what to know. Wednesday’s line-up features former President Bill Clinton, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Ms Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will give the night's prime-time speech after his nomination. Before Mr Walz speaks, delegates will hear from prominent US senators, including Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.  Two Democratic governors - Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Wes Moore of Maryland - who represent the next generation of party leadership will also have prominent roles. But the night will not only feature Democrats.  Olivia Troye, a Trump administration official, and Geoff Duncan, a Republican who served as Georgia's lieutenant governor until 2023, will give remarks as well.  The most important night of the convention is Thursday, when Vice-President Harris will take the stage. She will formally accept the presidential nomination and give her speech on the final night of the convention dedicated ""For the Future"". After the convention experienced a number of delays on Monday, DNC organisers said that the programme would begin earlier Tuesday, though speakers still ran late in the evening. During back-to-back speeches on Tuesday, Barack and Michelle Obama mixed gags with serious exhortations to Democrats to get out and vote in November - pointing out that Ms Harris was in a close race with Republican Donald Trump. ""Hope is making a comeback,"" said Mrs Obama. This was a contrast with the ""bluster and chaos"" of Trump's time in the White House, Mr Obama added. Another of the speakers was Trump's former spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, who said she had switched to voting for Ms Harris, explaining: ""I couldn't be part of the insanity any longer."" And America's Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, was introduced to the stage by his son Cole, who called him a ""goofy dad"".  Mr Emhoff went on to laud his wife, Ms Harris, as the ""right person"" for him and the presidency alike. On Monday, the convention heard from Mr Biden. During an emotional defence of his presidency, he said: ""America, I gave my best to you."" Hillary Clinton, who was presidential candidate in 2016, offered her own tribute to Mr Biden the same evening, and voiced her hope that Ms Harris could finally break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US by becoming the first female president. Others who spoke that night included progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Americans affected by abortion bans in Republican-controlled states. Because Ms Harris and Mr Walz were already nominated ahead of the event, this year's convention is focused on speeches from prominent Democrats and the adoption of the party’s platform. Delegates are working during the day to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence.  In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it. Members of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there will be plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself will offer live-streams on social media platforms. You can follow BBC News coverage - featuring on-site reporting and analysis - across the website and app, and on our live-stream.  The BBC News Channel will carry special coverage from 20:00 ET (01:00 BST) each night.

Around 50,000 people are expected at this year's convention in Chicago. This includes thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties as well as super delegates, who are major elected officials, notable members of the Democratic Party and some members of the Democratic National Committee. Thousands of members of the media will also be in attendance. It will be a star-studded convention with appearances from several celebrities. In 2020, actors Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Eva Longoria attended the convention, while Elizabeth Banks and America Ferrera appeared in 2016. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will attend this year, but neither has confirmed. Demonstrations have been taking place outside the DNC venue centre, focusing on opposition to US support of Israel’s war in Gaza.  A protest on Tuesday near Chicago's Israeli consulate culminated in scuffles between demonstrators and police and led to several arrests. Earlier, thousands of marchers took to the streets for a mostly peaceful protest on Monday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US support for Israel. Several were arrested when dozens of them broke through a security fence. The turnout appeared to be well below the tens of thousands that organisers had hoped for and short of the 15,000 they claimed were there. In that night's address, Mr Biden acknowledged that the activists ""have a point"", going on to say that ""a lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides"".",2024-08-21 23:10:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ey324neeo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

1594,Police hunt Arizona man who threatened to kill Trump,"Police are searching for an Arizona man who allegedly threatened to kill Donald Trump, a hunt that unfolded as the former president visited the border state. Police say Ronald Lee Syvrud, 66, of Cochise County, has made death threats against Trump in social media posts over the past fortnight. Trump was in Cochise County on Thursday visiting the US frontier with Mexico. Last month Trump was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Cochise County Sheriff’s Office says Syrvud is also wanted for failing to register as a sex offender. He faces several warrants in both Wisconsin and Arizona, including on charges of driving under the influence and a felony hit and run. Police say he is from Benson, Arizona, which is located about 50 miles (80km) south-east of Tucson. The Cochise County Sheriff's Office is asking the public for help to locate him. Mr Syrvud is described as a 6ft white male with white hair and green eyes. Trump spent Thursday in Cochise County, visiting the US-Mexico border. During his remarks, he sought to blame his rival, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, for allowing illegal immigrants into the US. The Republican's running mate, JD Vance, toured the same stretch of border in Sierra Vista several weeks ago. This isn't the first threat against a presidential candidate this election cycle. Earlier this month, a 66-year-old Virginia man was arrested on suspicion of making death threats against Vice-President Harris, among other public officials.",2024-08-22 23:09:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86l4p583y6o,Unknown,Unknown,,True

These delegates, who have not committed to backing Kamala Harris’s candidacy, tell me that they have pitched a whole range of possible speakers to the DNC and the Harris campaign - including several Democratic lawmakers - but they were told yesterday evening that none of them would be welcomed on stage.  Several of the delegates camped overnight outside the CNN-Politico Grill, a location for party leaders to hobnob with the press, in protest of the DNC’s decision.  At a press conference earlier, those leading this group of delegates and several lawmakers said that Harris campaign officials have been coming out every 20 to 30 minutes to negotiate. They say they won't move until they get a Palestinian speaker on the stage, but they haven't said what the consequences of the Harris campaign's missed deadline will be.  Stay tuned.

1610,Harris speech to provide finale to Democratic convention on day four,"Democrats will gather in Chicago on Thursday night where Vice-President Kamala Harris will make the biggest speech of her life, as she readies herself for the sprint before November's presidential election. On the final day of the Democratic National Convention, Ms Harris will formally accept her party's nomination - following a ceremonial roll call earlier in the week during which state delegates confirmed their support. Her running mate Tim Walz spoke on Wednesday night, making a personal pitch to middle America by giving a ""pep talk"" in the vein of an American football coach. US political conventions, which happen every four years before a presidential election, date back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered to nominate him for a second term. Here’s what to know about the 2024 DNC, which has been attended by thousands of people. The convention has all been building up to Thursday night. When she takes the stage, Vice-President Harris will formally accept the presidential nomination, and give a speech looking ahead to November. It will be the most significant address of her political career. Ms Harris became the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden stepped aside and gave her his backing, following weeks of pressure from party members. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who both represent swing states, are also expected to speak on Thursday - as is high-profile Republican Adam Kinzinger. Wednesday night was Mr Walz's first significant opportunity to introduce himself to the nation - and specifically to connect with middle America.  His speech was heavy on his personal story, including the importance of his family, his teaching career and time spent coaching a high-school football team, his stint in Army National Guard, and his service as a congressman and Minnesota governor. Long-time TV host Oprah Winfrey made a surprise appearance, receiving a raucous response and urging Americans to ""choose truth"" in the upcoming vote. Other prominent Democrats who featured on the same night included grandees Bill Clinton, the former president, and Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.  There were also appearances by rising stars such as Josh Shapiro, the governor of the swing state of Pennsylvania. Earlier in the week, the convention heard from President Joe Biden, who stepped aside last month for Ms Harris to contest the presidency. On Monday, he gave an emotional defence of his time in the White House: ""America, I gave my best to you."" The same evening, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, took the stage and voiced her hope that Ms Harris could finally break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US by becoming the first female president.

1606,Six swing states set to decide the 2024 US election,"About 240 million people are eligible to vote in this year’s US election, but only a relatively small number of them are likely to settle the question of who becomes the next president. Experts believe there are only a handful of states that could plausibly be won by Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, for the Democrats or Republicans respectively. Six of them - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - could hold the key to who will take the White House. Now, in the final months of the election, both campaigns are at full throttle to win over undecided voters in these states. The Democrats gained the presidency in 2020 with the support of the Grand Canyon State, which narrowly voted to back their party's candidate for the first time since the 1990s. This state borders Mexico for hundreds of miles, and has become a focal point of the nation’s immigration debate.  Border crossings have fallen in recent months from record highs which have made the issue near the top of voters' concerns.  Trump has repeatedly attacked Ms Harris’s record on immigration, because she was given a role by President Joe Biden in trying to ease the border crisis. He has also vowed to carry out “the largest deportation operation” in US history if he regains the presidency. Arizona has also hosted a bitter row over abortion access, after state Republicans attempted to reinstate a 160-year-old near-total ban on terminating pregnancies, but were foiled.  The issue has become an explosive one nationwide since 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned a landmark ruling that gave women the constitutional right to abortion. Our list of swing states closely matches the list of places where Trump-backed Republican officials tried to thwart Mr Biden’s win in the 2020 election.  In Georgia's Fulton County, alleged election interference has landed Mr Trump in one of his four criminal prosecutions (Trump has been convicted in one case, while the remaining are ongoing). He and 18 others are accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat to Mr Biden in the state. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and the case looks increasingly unlikely to be heard in court before the election. A third of Georgia's population is African-American, one of the country’s largest proportions of black residents, and it is believed that this demographic was instrumental in Mr Biden flipping the state in 2020.  Some disillusionment with Mr Biden had been reported among America’s black voters, but the Harris campaign hopes to animate this constituency. The Great Lakes state has picked the winning presidential candidate in the last two elections. Despite backing Mr Biden in 2020, it has become symbolic of a nationwide backlash over the president’s support for Israel during that country’s war in Gaza. During Michigan’s Democratic primary contest in February, more than 100,000 voters chose the “uncommitted” option on their ballots, part of a campaign mounted by activists who want the US government to halt its military aid to Israel. Notably, Michigan has the country’s largest proportion of Arab-Americans - a demographic whose support for Mr Biden was in jeopardy. But Ms Harris has taken a harder tone on Israel,  and some Gaza protesters have told the BBC they hope she will be more sympathetic to their cause. Trump has highlighted the state’s significance in his potential path to victory. Commenting on events in the Middle East, he has called on Israel to finish its campaign over Hamas in Gaza, but ""get it over with fast”. The Silver State has voted Democrat for the last several elections, but there are signs of a possible turnaround by the Republicans.  Recent averages published by poll-tracking firm 538 indicate that polls once showed Trump enjoying a wide lead over Mr Biden, but that advantage has shrunk since Ms Harris became the top of the ticket. Democrats had hoped a candidate with greater appeal to younger and more diverse voters would close the gap. Both candidates are vying to win the state’s sizeable Latino population. Despite the fact that the US economy has shown strong growth and jobs creation since Mr Biden took the presidency, the post-Covid recovery has been slower in Nevada than elsewhere. At 5.1%, the state has the highest unemployment rate in the country, after California and the District of Columbia, according to the latest US government statistics. If Trump comes to power again, he has vowed a return to an agenda of lower taxes across the board, and fewer regulations. Both sides have also been campaigning doggedly in the Keystone state, which is where Donald Trump survived an attempt on his life in July.  The state proved pivotal in the 2020 election, backing Mr Biden. He has a deep emotional connection to the working-class city of Scranton, where he grew up. The economy is a a top issue here, as well as many other places. Inflation spiked across the country under the Biden administration, before gradually reducing. Pennsylvanians are far from unique among Americans for feeling cost-of-living pressures as a result of inflation. But the price of groceries has risen faster in their state than in any other, according to market intelligence provider Datasembly. The BBC has previously reported on how people were struggling to cope in Erie - a bellwether county for the rest of Pennsylvania, where as many as one in eight people are considered “food insecure”. High inflation could hurt Ms Harris across the US as polling suggests it is giving voters an unfavourable view of the economy. Trump has sought to attack her by pinning her to the Biden economy.  The Badger State also picked the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, by a margin of little more than 20,000 votes each time. Pundits have suggested it is in marginal states like this one where an impact could be made by third-party candidates who are campaigning against the policies of the big two candidates. Polling has indicated that a sizeable show of support for independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr could harm the vote tallies for Ms Harris or Trump. Democrats have been fighting to have Green Party candidate Jill Stein removed from the ballot here, saying the party did not comply with state election laws, and has also filed an elections complaint against Cornel West, a left-leaning academic. Trump has described that state as “really important… if we win Wisconsin, we win the whole thing”. The summer Republican National Convention was held in Milwaukee.

The 23-year-old Norwegian had been the heavy favourite to win gold at Paris 2024, but misjudged the race which allowed Hocker of the United States to claim top spot on the podium. Ingebrigtsen ultimately ended that race in fourth as Great Britain's Josh Kerr and American Yared Nuguse also passed him in the closing stages of the race. There were few signs of a hangover from Ingebrigtsen at Stade Olympique de la Pontaise as he powered to an emphatic victory in three minutes 27.83 seconds. Hocker finished second in 3:29.85 while fellow American Hobbs Kessler came third. ""It's been almost two weeks since Paris so there was plenty of time to recover,"" Ingebrigtsen said. ""For me a lot of it has been mental including going home, taking some easy days and then getting back to work. ""Tonight's race gave me good answers and I'm looking forward to building on this for the rest of the season.""

Hall pipped Hudson-Smith to gold in the 400m at the Games in Paris by four-hundredths of a second. Hudson-Smith acknowledged his thoughts have already turned to the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. He said: ""My goal is to win the Olympic gold and to be mentioned alongside Michael Johnson and Jeremy Wariner. It's all about consistency, winning and never giving up. ""I want to consistently be one of the best ever and run consistently under 44 seconds, and maybe breaking the 43-second barrier."" Dina Asher-Smith won the women's 100m with a time of 10.88 seconds while fellow Briton Daryll Neita finished seventh. ""After the Olympics I took some time to refocus and now I'm just enjoying running, feeling fit and injury free,"" Asher-Smith said. Asher-Smith returned to the track later in the evening to win the women's 4x100m relay alongside Bianca Williams, Desiree Henry and Amy Hunt. The British quartet finished ahead of the Swiss team in a time of 42.03 seconds. Elsewhere, Olympic 1500m bronze medal winner Georgia Bell finished second in the women's 800m, as Kenya's Mary Moraa won in one minute 57.91 seconds.

1634,Secret Service agents put on leave over Trump shooting,"At least five US Secret Service agents have been placed on administrative leave following the attempt on Donald Trump's life in Pennsylvania, US media reports.  They include the head of the the Pittsburgh field office that coordinated security with local police, three other agents in the same office and a member of Trump's personal detail, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, was injured in the right ear by a bullet fired from a roof by Thomas Crooks, 20, at a rally in Butler on 13 July.  His burst of gunfire killed one crowd member and injured two others before he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper. Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said its review of ""this operational failure"" was ongoing, adding that agents were held to ""the highest professional standards"" and any violations could result in disciplinary action.  Kimberly Cheatle resigned as the service's director shortly after facing members of Congress in a contentious hearing where she failed to provide specific answers about the attack and her agents' response.  She has since been replaced by Ronald Rowe as acting director.  The House of Representatives has formed a task force to investigate the operational failures that allowed Crooks to fire on the crowd.

1627,Democrats are riding high - but victory is far from certain,"Kamala Harris strode out onto the Democratic convention stage on Thursday night and told Americans they had a “precious, fleeting opportunity” in front of them – to back her candidacy and consign the extraordinary period since Donald Trump entered the political arena nine years ago to history. Her 40-minute speech was not exactly the soaring oratory that the Obamas delivered earlier in the week, but the euphoria and confidence in the arena was palpable. With high-power celebrity endorsements and a widespread sense among Democrats that they are embarking on a new chapter, the party faithful have not been this excited since Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008. The jubilant atmosphere among delegates in Chicago is down to both relief that they don’t have to go into this election with Joe Biden, a candidate whose advanced age was a major liability, and delight at how seamlessly Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have assumed their places at the top of the ticket. But behind the scenes, party strategists are worried about Democratic voters and activists – who will need to turn out, knock on doors and convince their friends and family to head to a ballot box on 5 November – getting carried away. Opinion polls have moved in their direction in the weeks since President Biden stepped aside but this is still a very tight race. It will be won, too, in a handful of states – Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. In nearly all of those places, it seems either candidate could feasibly win. And if the past six weeks are any guide, the political dynamics could change quickly again in the 70 or so days left. Jim Messina, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, told the BBC’s Americast podcast that any certainty Democrats are on course for victory is misplaced. “Kamala Harris has, since she got in this race, had the best 30 days in American politics I’ve seen in a very long time,"" he said. ""But she is still tied [in the polls]. The Democrats have clawed up from five points down to tied. So it's still a tight race with 75 days left. “ The mood here may have hit fever pitch last night, but a toss-up race shows that Democrats still have a lot of work to do if they are to be sure of winning the White House. Trump appears to be struggling to work out how to campaign against Harris. He doesn’t seem to know what line of attack to take, and hasn’t even settled on one of his customary nicknames. One prominent Democratic strategist told me he believes Trump will soon work out how to define Ms Harris in a way that best serves his campaign, as that is his great political skill. And when he does this election will get much harder for Harris. For all the buoyancy and optimism that’s been radiating from the convention stage, there have been warnings too. In her speech on Tuesday night, Michelle Obama cautioned the election would be extremely tight. “We need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt,” she told the crowd. “We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us”. Her husband Barack Obama followed up with a similar exhortation, in what amounted to a one-two punch designed to motivate the thousands in the arena to hit the streets when they return to their hometowns across the country. “It’s up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in,” the former president said. “And make no mistake, it will be a fight.” Candidates standing for election in key swing states that will decide the outcome of this election know all too well how much work there is to do. “I’ve been telling Democrats everywhere I go this week: ‘Don’t get high on your own supply and think everyone is as energetic as you are’,” Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin, who is in a tight Senate race in Michigan, told Politico. On the convention floor, delegates clearly buoyed by the events of this week appeared to have taken the Obamas’ message to heart. Cameron Landin, a 21-year-old from Georgia, a key southern battleground state won by the Democrats in the last election for the first time in 28 years, said he knew victory could not be taken for granted. ""I really do believe Kamala Harris is going to win,"" he said, a few hours before Harris took to the stage. ""That doesn't mean I'm not nervous."" The regional organiser from the city of Savannah said people like him would focus on one thing: boosting turnout. ""That means people doing 60-plus-hour weeks and seven days a week of organising. It means volunteers getting out there – phone-banking, calling on voters, canvassing.” ""That's what's going to win this,"" he said, pointing at the crowd of delegates waving posters for Harris and Walz. ""People on the ground."" Nevada Democratic Representative Susie Lee, who represents a district that includes part of Las Vegas – said she was under no illusions the election would be extremely competitive, particularly in her swing state. ""It's not at all in the bag,"" she said. Some precincts in Nevada, she explained, could be decided by as little as 50 to 100 votes. “Clearly, we have to get people engaged and out to the polls. ""But I'll tell you - I do think people are exhausted with Donald Trump,"" the congresswoman said. ""There's a clear choice between Harris and Trump. I think people see it."" Millions of voters watched the political festival the Democrats put on in Chicago – more than 20m viewers tuned in for each of the first three nights. The Harris-Walz team will almost certainly get a further bump in the opinion polls after this week. But that’s to be expected following any party convention. The question will be whether the momentum they have been riding will last, especially as the country learns more about Harris, who has so far avoided tough media interviews and released little in the way of policy detail. Trump has a grip on nearly half of the country. And they know him well after three successive presidential campaigns. The Democrats could certainly win this election, but they will have their work cut out.

1646,Four takeaways from biggest address of Harris's career,"Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, delivering a speech which hit the key notes her campaign wanted - but had only rare moments of soaring rhetoric and broke little new ground. The ground-breaking was in the nature of the nominee herself - the first woman of colour to become a major party's presidential nominee. “Never let anyone tell you who you are,” Ms Harris said. “You show them who you are.” But for roughly 45 minutes on Thursday, she tried to tell Americans who she is - and what she would do if she wins the White House.  Here are four takeaways from her convention-closing remarks.  Many Americans know who Ms Harris is, but not many know what she believes in or details of her background. First and foremost, her convention speech set out to change that. She recounted her mother’s journey as an immigrant from India. She spoke about how her parents met – and how they ultimately divorced. She talked about her childhood upbringing in a working-class neighbourhood in Oakland, California. “The middle class is where I come from,” she said. “My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us.” Ms Harris also spoke of why she chose to become a lawyer – and a prosecutor. She drew a line from her early days in the courtroom to her public services as a politician. “My entire career, I have only had one client,” she said. “The people.” Ms Harris’s speech included calls for unity and a pathway beyond the “bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles” of modern American politics. She said that the US had a “precious, fleeting” opportunity to “chart a new path forward”. But that chart had few details. Vague calls for unity and a path beyond partisanship are rhetoric many presidential hopefuls have used in the past.  When Ms Harris did turn to policy details, she spoke in generalities.  She said she will be focused on lowering the costs of “everyday needs” – including healthcare, housing and groceries. She specifically called out abortion rights – and framed it as a means of preserving freedom, which has been a recurring theme at this Democratic convention. “America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially about matters of heart and home,” she said. Ms Harris, in her speech, styled herself as a centre-left moderate, putting little daylight between her policies and those of her boss, the man she hopes to replace, Joe Biden. “Everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation ready to move forward,” she said. “Ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America.” The exact details of that step, however, are to be determined. As pro-Palestinian protesters marched outside the convention, Ms Harris devoted particular attention in the foreign-policy section of her speech to the Gaza war. Here, yet again, there was little difference between her rhetoric and views and those of Mr Biden – and she linked herself to the president several times. “President Biden and I are working around the clock,” she said, “because now is the time to get a hostage deal and ceasefire done.” She also pledged to ensure that Israel always has the ability to defend itself and took particular note of the brutality of the 7 October Hamas attack. For a moment, it sounded like some in the crowd would jeer, but Ms Harris quickly moved on to the plight of Palestinians, saying that the scale of their suffering was “heartbreaking”. That will hardly be enough to satisfy the protesters outside, however, and they could return to their homes – some in key battleground states like Michigan – convinced that a Harris presidency would be a continuation of the Biden Gaza War policies. Two days ago, Michelle and Barack Obama formed a tag-team that belittled former president Donald Trump for what they charaterised as his small obsessions and petty personality. Ms Harris also took swipes at her Republican opponent, but they were pretty standard fare for Democrats – including Mr Biden - over the past few months. “In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man,” she said. “But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.” She brought up the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, and mentioned his criminal convictions. She also hit what has become a favourite Democratic punching bag, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a Republican presidency. Although the former president has disavowed the plan, she noted that it was written by his advisers and it sought to “pull our country back into the past”. The future vs the past contrast has been a central theme of the Harris campaign so far, as it was in her nomination acceptance speech.  It’s one of the ways the vice-president has been able to draw a distinction not only from her current Republican opponent, but from the unpopular aspects of her boss, Joe Biden, who just a few weeks ago was the presumptive Democratic nominee.

1641,Trump lashes out as DNC attacks throw him off message,"Donald Trump isn't in Chicago but his presence hangs over everything and he is clearly following events here. Ahead of Kamala Harris's speech on Thursday, a couple of Trump aides told me, a little implausibly, that the former president is not tuning into the Democratic National Convention because he has no interest in watching a Democratic Party ""infomercial"".  But one senior campaign official confirms, anonymously, that Trump is watching and is irritated by the attacks against him. In the view of one ally who speaks to the former president every week, Trump wins in November if he sticks to talking about the economy, the border and crime. At the start of this week, that looked possible. Trump scheduled a string of rallies, in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona - each was themed to focus on exactly those political and economic topics. But with night after night of anti-Trump speeches here in Chicago, staying on message has gone out the window. And it's not what his supporters tell him they want anyway. The North Carolina event on Wednesday was vintage Trump - and it became a referendum on his own team's strategy. ""They always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy, don't get personal'... and yet [the Democrats are] getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?"" Trump asked. Then he polled the crowd: more policy or go personal? His fans roared, they wanted the Trump show, not a list of boring economic proposals. ""My advisers are fired!"" he joked. Then he said he'd stick to policy but couldn't let the attacks go unanswered. So the campaign strategy now seems to be at the whim of the candidate and the feedback of his crowds. That makes life difficult for his campaign advisers who repeatedly tell me their single biggest concern in this election campaign is whether they can keep Trump focused on issues and off the controversial personal attacks. There have been a couple of those this week already. Late on Wednesday night, Trump took to social media to criticise the Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who had given a rousing speech earlier in the evening. Trump clearly didn’t like what he heard. ""The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech,"" Trump wrote.  ""I have done more for Israel than any President…Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will."" The fact that he singled out Mr Shapiro as Jewish has not gone unnoticed. It was picked up on the US morning shows as an example of a racial dog whistle. After the Obamas criticised Trump at the DNC on Tuesday night, he responded during his rally in North Carolina, and, again, there was a similar racial innuendo. ""Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night,"" Trump said. ""He was taking shots at your president. And so was Michelle."" It's true that they did take pretty personal shots at him, but the use of Mr Obama's middle name has long been used to stoke racial animosity towards him. The problem for the Trump team is that their candidate thrives on controversy which then dominates headlines, and this distracts from their attempts to point out weaknesses in his opponent's policy positions. ""It doesn't matter what he talks about for 45 minutes,"" one adviser told me on the condition of anonymity. ""One comment or answer to a question gives the left all they need to change the subject.""

1636,"This Australian election is about cost of living, crime - and pet crocs","Having a pet crocodile in the backyard sounds like a far-fetched Australian fable – like riding kangaroos to school or the existence of drop bears. But in the Northern Territory (NT), it’s a reality. And Trevor Sullivan has 11 of the reptiles sharing his tropical home in Batchelor, about an hour south of Darwin. Among them is Big Jack, who is named after a Jack in the Box toy due to his alarming propensity for lunging. Despite his antics, the giant predator is adored, having joined Mr Sullivan’s household as a hatchling the same day his daughter was born 22 years ago. “He’s been part of our family ever since… [my daughter] refers to him as brother.” Also on the 80-acre property is Cricket, still a tiny critter, and Shah, who - at the complete other end of the scale - is more than a century old and has truly lived a life. “He’s possibly seen two world wars and maybe federation in Australia [in 1901],” Mr Sullivan says of the 4.7m (15.4ft) beast. He claims Shah once killed a man, has been used for scientific research, was almost poisoned to death at a bird park, and lost half his bottom jaw in a fight at a Queensland crocodile farm, all before joining Mr Sullivan a few years ago. The 60-year-old lights up as he tells the BBC about his crocodiles: “There's nothing like them... crocodiles are the Harley Davidson of pets.” But as the famously quirky region heads to the polls on Saturday, the right to own a pet croc has turned into a somewhat unlikely – and very Territory – election issue. The cost of living, housing and crime are the prime concerns for many voters, but Mr Sullivan is one of scores left heartbroken after the governing Labor Party moved to ban crocodiles as pets. It is one of the last places in the country the practice is allowed, but the government says they're concerned for the wellbeing of both humans and the reptiles. The Country Liberal Party opposition, however, has pledged its support for the practice and has promised a review of the “rushed” decision if elected. About 250,000 people call the NT home, but relatively few of them own crocodiles. The environment minister's office said they could not provide a figure because the government is in election caretaker mode, but previous estimates have put the number of permit holders at around 100. Many of the captive crocs are raised from hatchlings, others rehomed from farms or after causing trouble in the wild. Regulations have long dictated strict conditions about where, and under what conditions, the animals can be kept. For example, hatchlings can only live in urban areas until they are 60cm long – usually about a year old – at which point they must be handed over to authorities or moved to a property outside the town limits. Under those rules, however, owners were not required to have any special training or knowledge to keep the beasts. Tom Hayes says owning – or “saving” – a crocodile is part of the Territory’s appeal, and one of the factors which drew his young family to the Darwin region, from Queensland, earlier this year. The 40-year-old grew up taking trips to the NT with his dad, fishing in the Mary River alongside giant crocodiles, instilling a love of predators and, eventually, a dream to have his own one day. “I'm not just some dude that wants a crocodile [for] when I'm having a barbecue with my mates on the weekend,"" the tattooist and self-styled conservationist told the BBC. “I wanted to have somewhere I could bring these poor old buggers and they could just live their lives out - happy, fed… not having to worry about people shooting them.” He was in process of adopting a mega croc when the NT government announced it would not be issuing any new permits to keep the reptiles as pets. It has left Mr Hayes reeling and the crocodile he’d hoped to rescue at risk of being put down. NT Environment Minister Kate Worden said the decision was made ""after public consultation"" and ""taking into account personal safety and animal welfare concerns"". Existing permits will remain valid, but transfers of permits will not be allowed. ""Let's remember they are an apex predator and probably not one that's best kept for captivity,"" Ms Worden told reporters, adding that there were instances of crocodiles attacking their owners in the region. The new rules bring the NT in in line with every other state and territory in Australia - except, oddly, Victoria, which is well outside of the comfortable climate of a saltwater crocodile. Animal activists, who had been pushing for the change, say it’s a big win. While some of the people keeping crocodiles “may have good intentions”, no wild animal can have its needs fully met in captivity, argues Olivia Charlton, from World Animal Protection. “There is no way to replicate the space and freedom these crocodiles would have in the wild, particularly given they live for up to 70 years,” she said in a statement. Charles Giliam, from the RSPCA NT, said the dangerous nature of crocodiles also made it extremely hard for authorities to regulate the program and ensure the reptiles had an acceptable standard of living and medical care. “I only know one vet who’s prepared to work with crocodiles,” he said, as an example. But croc owners say they had no idea the change was coming and are distressed over what may now happen to their pets. “I don't think you spend many nights on the couch watching TV, snuggling with your four-and-a-half-meter crocodile… but there's still that emotional attachment,” Mr Hayes says. They accuse the government of hiding the change in a broader Crocodile Management Plan to avoid doing true consultation on the issue. The opposition environment spokeswoman Jo Hersey said ""the [Country Liberal Party] supports the rights of Territorians to own crocs as pets under a permit system"" and has promised the party will look at the rules if elected. Both Mr Hayes and Mr Sullivan said there is broad support for greater training and education requirements for permit holders. But they say the reptiles are surprisingly easy to care for – and reject arguments that keeping them as pets is harmful. “In the wild, they have a stretch of territory and they then have to fight to keep it. They’re forever hunting for food, forever chasing off their enemies or trying to keep their girlfriend sorted and life’s pretty tough going,” Mr Sullivan says. “In captivity, if they got a good enclosure, plenty of water, sunlight, a bit of shade, and food on a regular basis, they just love it. “I have a river running through my property and I actually have wild crocs always trying to get in and join my mob.” The decision to end the practice is particularly bad timing for Mr Sullivan. He listed his home and his menagerie for sale last year, so he could join his partner in New Zealand. “It is a bit like a Willy Wonka story – I want some young kids, of the right nature, to take on a property full of wildlife.” But that’s left him with a quandary that belongs in a maths textbook: If you have 80 acres and 11 crocodiles on the market, but zero permits available to transfer, what’s the answer? There is “not a chance” he’ll euthanise his crocs, he says. “I'll have to stay on the property until I die, or until something else changes.” His hope is resting on the election of a CLP government on Saturday, adding he thinks it is an issue which will galvanise voters. But Mr Hayes, on the other hand, hopes it isn’t. There are greater issues at play which should decide votes, he explains, and he is optimistic that both parties will come to see sense anyway. “Whoever's in needs to really look at it… It's an attack on the Territory way of life.”",2024-08-23 23:09:40,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rxyz1p830o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1662,"Light on policy, heavy on 'vibes' - can Harris defeat Trump?","The month since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign has been a largely unprecedented spell in American politics: never has a modern general election campaign gone from a standstill to a full sprint so quickly.  In that time Democrats pulled together a well-scripted national convention with slickly produced promotional videos, political set-pieces and musical interludes, all done to boost the new nominee. It was a remarkable test of skill by party operatives under extreme pressure. Over the course of four days in Chicago – and in the packed campaign rallies Ms Harris has held over the past few weeks – the outlines of her campaign strategy have begun to take shape.  And it’s not exactly what one would expect from a sitting vice-president who has occupied an office in the White House for three-and-a-half-years. Ms Harris is pushing hard to be viewed as the candidate of change in this race. One who, as she said in her convention speech on Thursday, can ""chart a new way forward"". This strategy is in part born out of necessity. Across the globe democracies have been roiled by voter unrest. As economies struggle to recover from the Covid pandemic, regional conflicts churn and tensions over immigration flare up, political incumbents have faced deeply unhappy electorates in Canada, the UK, Germany and India among others. Polling indicated that President Joe Biden, before he abandoned his re-election campaign last month, was set to confront similar challenges. The vice-president has turned this situation on its head. Her background and personal story is a sharp contrast with both the current president and her Republican opponent. It also helps that Ms Harris is running against a former president who, while also styling himself as a change candidate, has his own sometimes controversial, sometimes unpopular White House record to defend. “This election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for the future,” Ms Harris said at a rally in North Carolina last week.  “Ours focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.” For the most part, Ms Harris has shied away from describing in detail what her presidency would look like.  There’s talk of unity and a way beyond America’s divisive partisanship; a focus on strengthening the economy and reducing consumer prices; and a heavy emphasis on reproductive rights and abortion – an area of particular strength for Democrats. But it is vague. And this vagueness may suit the Harris campaign just fine.  By largely being an empty policy vessel, Ms Harris has allowed various constituencies within the Democratic Party to project their hopes and priorities onto her.  If she can keep all those pieces together for the next few months, she might just win. Labour leaders expressed optimism that she would focus on union protections and bread-and-butter economic issues.  Climate activists touted the Biden administration’s clean energy legislation and expected the candidate to expand that effort.  Civil rights leaders predicted the first woman of colour to win a major party nomination would advance racial equality. “The fundamental question people ask is, are you fighting for me, or are you fighting for someone else?” said Tom Perez, who served as secretary of labour in the Obama administration and has been an adviser to the Biden White House.  ""I think people have a pretty clear sense that she's a fighter for everyone, not just certain people in certain zip codes or certain tax brackets, not just people of certain races or ethnicities, but everyone."" In other words, the vice-president’s policy vagueness has allowed her to cast as broad an appeal as possible in what is shaping up to be an election where every undecided voter counts.  It has been labelled by some as a ""vibe"" campaign - based at least in part on feeling and general impressions. On Wednesday, former television host, author and international celebrity Oprah Winfrey, who identified herself as a political independent, said Ms Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were the candidates who would deliver “decency and respect”. “I’m calling on all you independents and all you undecideds,” she said. “Values and character matter most of all, in leadership and in life.” Throughout the week, a parade of Republicans – including former officeholders and Donald Trump supporters – also took the stage at the convention to pitch Harris as the best option in November. “Harris will want to be centre-left, not far-left,” said Chris Shays, a former Republican congressman from Connecticut who attended the Democratic Convention this year. According to Mr Shays, the vice-president will be pulled to the American political middle because that is where the nation is. Ms Harris’s strategy is not without risk, however.  Just as Democratic groups are projecting their ideas onto the vice-president’s campaign, so are her Republican opponents. And they are using Ms Harris’s past, more liberal – and sometimes controversial – positions and statements as evidence that the lack of specificity is merely a cover for a left-wing agenda. “Her speech was the perfect example of what happens when you have no solutions to offer for the problems you've delivered to Americans' doorsteps, so you gaslight and deflect,” the Trump campaign said in a statement responding to the vice-president’s convention address. Ms Harris has also avoided sweeping press conferences and more pointed interviews with mainstream media outlets so far – interviews that could hold her to account for past positions and press her for further policy details. Her speech last week addressing the economy was one of the few instances where the vice-president unveiled concrete new proposals. But over the past four days some nuggets of how she would govern have emerged. She has proposed a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She pledged to use the power of government to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and punish price-gouging for groceries. She backed bipartisan immigration legislation that was blocked in the Senate earlier this year. Ms Harris also pledged to push for a federal law that would guarantee a basic right to abortion across the entire US, pre-empting conservative state bans. For some Democrats the details so far aren’t enough. “We need to hear some actual policy things,” said Lewanna Tucker, chair of the Democratic Party in Fulton County, Georgia. “She needs to be letting us a little bit more behind the curtain and talk about structural things that are going to be done.” Perhaps more concrete policy details aren't necessary. At a time when American politics is viewed by much of the American public as divisive and toxic, there may be benefit to building a political campaign not around policy specifics, but rather one that appeals to emotion.  In 2008, Barack Obama successfully campaigned on hope and change – which is not exactly the makings of a four-point plan. “It's a return to a level of hope that I don't think that we have collectively experienced since 2008,” said Yasmin Radjy, who runs the liberal grassroots organising group Swing Left. She said there had been an exhaustion among volunteers on the left for the past eight years, but the switch to Ms Harris was “like a weight had lifted off their shoulders"". The willingness by Democrats to savage the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 – a sometimes controversial blueprint for a new Republican administration that Trump and his campaign have repeatedly disavowed – also shows the risks of being even tangentially associated with the nuts and bolts of governing. In her Thursday night address, Ms Harris pledged to move beyond partisan divisions and find shared common ground. ""I promise to be a president for all Americans,"" she said. ""You can always trust me to put country above party and self."" Those promises aren’t unfamiliar in American politics, of course. Similar assurances have been made over the last few decades. But something has been different about this Democratic nominee and Democratic convention. The wattage of star power this week – with appearances by Pink, Stevie Wonder and Lil Jon, among others – and the campaign’s heavy reliance on pop culture connections, like Charlie XCX, suggest it is trying to position itself as a cultural movement rather than a political one. It remains to be seen whether this will be an effective strategy. But at least for now, it has pulled the Democratic Party out of the doldrums and despair of early July and into a dead heat with Trump and the Republicans heading into the crucial final months of this campaign.",2024-08-24 23:10:13,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cged20l3nq8o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1670,Democrats are riding high but victory is far from certain,"Kamala Harris strode out onto the Democratic convention stage on Thursday night and told Americans they had a “precious, fleeting opportunity” in front of them – to back her candidacy and consign the extraordinary period since Donald Trump entered the political arena nine years ago to history. Her 40-minute speech was not exactly the soaring oratory that the Obamas delivered earlier in the week, but the euphoria and confidence in the arena was palpable. With high-power celebrity endorsements and a widespread sense among Democrats that they are embarking on a new chapter, the party faithful have not been this excited since Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008. The jubilant atmosphere among delegates in Chicago is down to both relief that they don’t have to go into this election with Joe Biden, a candidate whose advanced age was a major liability, and delight at how seamlessly Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have assumed their places at the top of the ticket. But behind the scenes, party strategists are worried about Democratic voters and activists – who will need to turn out, knock on doors and convince their friends and family to head to a ballot box on 5 November – getting carried away. Opinion polls have moved in their direction in the weeks since President Biden stepped aside but this is still a very tight race. It will be won, too, in a handful of states – Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. In nearly all of those places, it seems either candidate could feasibly win. And if the past six weeks are any guide, the political dynamics could change quickly again in the 70 or so days left. Jim Messina, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, told the BBC’s Americast podcast that any certainty Democrats are on course for victory is misplaced. “Kamala Harris has, since she got in this race, had the best 30 days in American politics I’ve seen in a very long time,"" he said. ""But she is still tied [in the polls]. The Democrats have clawed up from five points down to tied. So it's still a tight race with 75 days left. “ The mood here may have hit fever pitch last night, but a toss-up race shows that Democrats still have a lot of work to do if they are to be sure of winning the White House. Trump appears to be struggling to work out how to campaign against Harris. He doesn’t seem to know what line of attack to take, and hasn’t even settled on one of his customary nicknames. One prominent Democratic strategist told me he believes Trump will soon work out how to define Ms Harris in a way that best serves his campaign, as that is his great political skill. And when he does this election will get much harder for Harris. For all the buoyancy and optimism that’s been radiating from the convention stage, there have been warnings too. In her speech on Tuesday night, Michelle Obama cautioned the election would be extremely tight. “We need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt,” she told the crowd. “We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us”. Her husband Barack Obama followed up with a similar exhortation, in what amounted to a one-two punch designed to motivate the thousands in the arena to hit the streets when they return to their hometowns across the country. “It’s up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in,” the former president said. “And make no mistake, it will be a fight.” Candidates standing for election in key swing states that will decide the outcome of this election know all too well how much work there is to do. “I’ve been telling Democrats everywhere I go this week: ‘Don’t get high on your own supply and think everyone is as energetic as you are’,” Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin, who is in a tight Senate race in Michigan, told Politico. On the convention floor, delegates clearly buoyed by the events of this week appeared to have taken the Obamas’ message to heart. Cameron Landin, a 21-year-old from Georgia, a key southern battleground state won by the Democrats in the last election for the first time in 28 years, said he knew victory could not be taken for granted. ""I really do believe Kamala Harris is going to win,"" he said, a few hours before Harris took to the stage. ""That doesn't mean I'm not nervous."" The regional organiser from the city of Savannah said people like him would focus on one thing: boosting turnout. ""That means people doing 60-plus-hour weeks and seven days a week of organising. It means volunteers getting out there – phone-banking, calling on voters, canvassing.” ""That's what's going to win this,"" he said, pointing at the crowd of delegates waving posters for Harris and Walz. ""People on the ground."" Nevada Democratic Representative Susie Lee, who represents a district that includes part of Las Vegas – said she was under no illusions the election would be extremely competitive, particularly in her swing state. ""It's not at all in the bag,"" she said. Some precincts in Nevada, she explained, could be decided by as little as 50 to 100 votes. “Clearly, we have to get people engaged and out to the polls. ""But I'll tell you - I do think people are exhausted with Donald Trump,"" the congresswoman said. ""There's a clear choice between Harris and Trump. I think people see it."" Millions of voters watched the political festival the Democrats put on in Chicago – more than 20m viewers tuned in for each of the first three nights. The Harris-Walz team will almost certainly get a further bump in the opinion polls after this week. But that’s to be expected following any party convention. The question will be whether the momentum they have been riding will last, especially as the country learns more about Harris, who has so far avoided tough media interviews and released little in the way of policy detail. Trump has a grip on nearly half of the country. And they know him well after three successive presidential campaigns. The Democrats could certainly win this election, but they will have their work cut out.

1679,Global athletes to follow at Paris Paralympics,"Simone Barlaam will lead the Italian Para-swimming charge in Paris Paris will welcome about 4,500 athletes to the city to compete in the first summer Paralympics to be hosted by France. Competitors will take part in 22 sports across the 11 days of competition with 549 gold medals up for grabs. The Games will feature the usual mix of experienced international stars hoping to enhance their reputations and newcomers aiming to make their mark. BBC Sport looks at some of the global athletes who are aiming to shine on the biggest stage when action starts on Thursday, 29 August. Barlaam has been a key figure in Italy's emergence as a Paralympic powerhouse in the pool. The 24-year-old from Milan, who was born with one leg shorter than the other because of a hip issue, spent time in Paris as a child as he had a number of surgeries. After starting swimming competitively aged 14, he made his international debut at the 2017 World Championships in Mexico and has become a leading performer in the S9 category. Barlaam says he struggled at his first Paralympics in Tokyo, where he won gold, two silvers and a bronze, but comes to Paris after winning six golds in six races at last year's Worlds in Manchester and is a strong favourite to add to his tally. S9 400m freestyle: Thursday, 29 August; S9 50m freestyle Monday, 2 September; S9 100m backstroke: Tuesday, 3 September; S9 100m butterfly: Friday, 6 September; Mixed 4x100m freestyle 34 point relay: Saturday, 7 September Diede de Groot is world number one in both singles and doubles Dutch women have dominated wheelchair tennis for many years and De Groot is the latest star. The 27-year-old is world number one in both singles and doubles and won gold in both events in Tokyo, the latter with Aniek van Koot. Born with her right leg shorter than the other, she started playing wheelchair tennis aged seven and has dominated the sport since her breakthrough in 2017. She is the first player - wheelchair or non-disabled - to win three successive calendar Grand Slams and among her multiple titles are five French Open singles and six doubles titles at Roland Garros, where the Paralympic wheelchair tennis events will take place. Earlier this year, she was named the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability - following compatriot Esther Vergeer who won it in 2002 and 2008. Women's doubles final: Thursday, 5 September; Women's singles final: Friday, 6 September. Marcel Hug won four golds at the Tokyo Paralympics Hug's silver helmet has seen him dubbed the Silver Bullet but he is no stranger to gold and, as one of the stars of his sport, the 38-year-old will be hoping to add to his six Paralympic titles at the Stade de France. Hug was second best to Britain's David Weir at London 2012 but made his breakthrough four years later in Rio. The Swiss won his first gold in Rio in the T54 800m before adding another in the marathon. In Tokyo, he completed a clean sweep of wins in the 800m, 1500m, 5,000m and marathon before adding another three golds on the track in Paris at last year's Worlds. As well as the track, Hug also stars on the road and has multiple wins in the big city marathons of London, New York, Boston, Chicago and Berlin. T54 5,000m: Saturday, 31 August; T54 1500m: Tuesday, 3 September; T54 800m: Thursday, 5 September; T54 Marathon: Sunday, 8 September. Oksana Masters started out as a rower before switching to Para-cycling and cross-country skiing Masters has overcome much trauma to become a star of both summer and winter Paralympics. She was born in Ukraine in 1989 with multiple birth defects, three years after the Chernobyl disaster, and after being abandoned by her birth parents she grew up in an orphanage where she was regularly beaten and abused. Aged seven, she was adopted by American woman Gay Masters and eventually had both of her legs amputated above the knee and had surgery on her hands. After starting her sporting career as a rower and competing at London 2012, winning bronze, she switched to Para-cycling and cross-country skiing. She won two golds at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang before securing two golds on the road in Japan, then following up with three more golds at the 2022 Winters in Beijing in cross-country and biathlon. Last year, she released her autobiography, The Hard Parts, where she told her powerful story. H4-5 time trial: Wednesday, 4 September; H5 road race: Thursday, 5 September Markus Rehm's current long jump world record stands at 8.72m The man known as the Blade Jumper is an overwhelming favourite to win a fourth Paralympic long jump title in Paris. Rehm, who lost his right leg below the knee in a wakeboarding accident in 2003 and jumps using a bladed prosthesis, has been the star of Para-athletics since his international debut at the 2011 Worlds in New Zealand, constantly pushing the boundaries of his T64 event. His current world record stands at 8.72m - the ninth-longest jump of all time and his 2024 best is 8.44m - a distance which would have won Olympic silver in Paris and gold at the previous four Games. However, he is unable to compete at the Olympics because it was ruled that jumping off his prosthesis gives him an advantage over non-amputees. The Olympics' loss is the Paralympics' gain and Rehm in full flight is a sight to behold. T64 long jump: Wednesday, 4 September Sheetal Devi is the first and only female Para-archer to compete internationally without arms Aged only 17, Devi will be one of the youngest competitors both in archery and at the Games as a whole. The Indian was born with a condition called phocomelia and is missing her upper limbs. However, she shoots arrows using her feet and is the first and only female Para-archer to compete internationally without arms. She discovered archery three years ago and although coaches initially suggested that she use a prosthesis, she gained inspiration from American Matt Stutzman, the 2012 Paralympic silver medallist and 2022 world champion who was also born without arms. Her first major event was at the 2022 Asian Para Games where she won women's individual compound gold and mixed doubles gold. She also took silver in the women's doubles before claiming individual world silver last year and goes in as world number one. Women's individual compound: Saturday 31 August; Mixed team compound: Monday, 2 September All you need to know about the Paris Paralympics GB athletes to follow in Paris Paralympics Alexis Hanquinquant is unbeaten since winning gold at the Tokyo Games in 2021 The 38-year-old from Normandy is one of France's main hopes for gold at the Games. Hanquinquant is the defending Paralympic champion in the PTS4 category and has been the dominant figure in the division since his international debut in June 2016. He is unbeaten since his Tokyo win. A keen basketball player and combat sports practitioner, he had a work accident in 2010 and had his leg amputated below the knee three years later. He made his Para-sport breakthrough too late for Rio but by Tokyo he was a multiple world champion and secured gold by almost three minutes from his nearest rival. Along with Para-athlete Nantenin Keita, the father of two was voted by his team-mates to carry the French flag at the opening ceremony of the Paris Games. Men's PTS4 triathlon: Sunday, 1 September. Stickney's first sporting dream was to swim at the Olympics and she was ranked nationally in the top 20 aged 15 before she broke bones in her left foot - which was eventually amputated in May 2018 because of pain and complications. That was the start of her medical challenges, which led to her being diagnosed with a rare vascular condition which prevents sufficient blood supply from reaching her limbs. Stickney had a second below-the-knee amputation in 2019 and said then she would never swim again, but returned to the pool during the Covid pandemic and fell back in love with the sport. She went on to win two golds in Tokyo - her first international Para-swimming event. Since then, the condition has progressed and she has lost more of her legs and it is also affecting her whole body. In the build-up to the Games, Stickney, now 27, has had to spend 10 days or more in hospital in Boston every month for treatment but is fiercely determined to once again shine on the big stage.

1685,Kamala Harris campaign is light on policy - but that's helped her transform the race,"The month since Kamala Harris launched her presidential campaign has been a largely unprecedented spell in American politics: never has a modern general election campaign gone from a standstill to a full sprint so quickly.  In that time Democrats pulled together a well-scripted national convention with slickly produced promotional videos, political set-pieces and musical interludes, all done to boost the new nominee. It was a remarkable test of skill by party operatives under extreme pressure. Over the course of four days in Chicago – and in the packed campaign rallies Ms Harris has held over the past few weeks – the outlines of her campaign strategy have begun to take shape.  And it’s not exactly what one would expect from a sitting vice-president who has occupied an office in the White House for three-and-a-half-years. Ms Harris is pushing hard to be viewed as the candidate of change in this race. One who, as she said in her convention speech on Thursday, can ""chart a new way forward"". This strategy is in part born out of necessity. Across the globe democracies have been roiled by voter unrest. As economies struggle to recover from the Covid pandemic, regional conflicts churn and tensions over immigration flare up, political incumbents have faced deeply unhappy electorates in Canada, the UK, Germany and India among others. Polling indicated that President Joe Biden, before he abandoned his re-election campaign last month, was set to confront similar challenges. The vice-president has turned this situation on its head. Her background and personal story is a sharp contrast with both the current president and her Republican opponent. It also helps that Ms Harris is running against a former president who, while also styling himself as a change candidate, has his own sometimes controversial, sometimes unpopular White House record to defend. “This election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for the future,” Ms Harris said at a rally in North Carolina last week.  “Ours focused on the future, and the other focused on the past.” For the most part, Ms Harris has shied away from describing in detail what her presidency would look like.  There’s talk of unity and a way beyond America’s divisive partisanship; a focus on strengthening the economy and reducing consumer prices; and a heavy emphasis on reproductive rights and abortion – an area of particular strength for Democrats. But it is vague. And this vagueness may suit the Harris campaign just fine.  By largely being an empty policy vessel, Ms Harris has allowed various constituencies within the Democratic Party to project their hopes and priorities onto her.  If she can keep all those pieces together for the next few months, she might just win. Labour leaders expressed optimism that she would focus on union protections and bread-and-butter economic issues.  Climate activists touted the Biden administration’s clean energy legislation and expected the candidate to expand that effort.  Civil rights leaders predicted the first woman of colour to win a major party nomination would advance racial equality. “The fundamental question people ask is, are you fighting for me, or are you fighting for someone else?” said Tom Perez, who served as secretary of labour in the Obama administration and has been an adviser to the Biden White House.  ""I think people have a pretty clear sense that she's a fighter for everyone, not just certain people in certain zip codes or certain tax brackets, not just people of certain races or ethnicities, but everyone."" In other words, the vice-president’s policy vagueness has allowed her to cast as broad an appeal as possible in what is shaping up to be an election where every undecided voter counts.  It has been labelled by some as a ""vibe"" campaign - based at least in part on feeling and general impressions. On Wednesday, former television host, author and international celebrity Oprah Winfrey, who identified herself as a political independent, said Ms Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were the candidates who would deliver “decency and respect”. “I’m calling on all you independents and all you undecideds,” she said. “Values and character matter most of all, in leadership and in life.” Throughout the week, a parade of Republicans – including former officeholders and Donald Trump supporters – also took the stage at the convention to pitch Harris as the best option in November. “Harris will want to be centre-left, not far-left,” said Chris Shays, a former Republican congressman from Connecticut who attended the Democratic Convention this year. According to Mr Shays, the vice-president will be pulled to the American political middle because that is where the nation is. Ms Harris’s strategy is not without risk, however.  Just as Democratic groups are projecting their ideas onto the vice-president’s campaign, so are her Republican opponents. And they are using Ms Harris’s past, more liberal – and sometimes controversial – positions and statements as evidence that the lack of specificity is merely a cover for a left-wing agenda. “Her speech was the perfect example of what happens when you have no solutions to offer for the problems you've delivered to Americans' doorsteps, so you gaslight and deflect,” the Trump campaign said in a statement responding to the vice-president’s convention address. Ms Harris has also avoided sweeping press conferences and more pointed interviews with mainstream media outlets so far – interviews that could hold her to account for past positions and press her for further policy details. Her speech last week addressing the economy was one of the few instances where the vice-president unveiled concrete new proposals. But over the past four days some nuggets of how she would govern have emerged. She has proposed a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She pledged to use the power of government to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and punish price-gouging for groceries. She backed bipartisan immigration legislation that was blocked in the Senate earlier this year. Ms Harris also pledged to push for a federal law that would guarantee a basic right to abortion across the entire US, pre-empting conservative state bans. For some Democrats the details so far aren’t enough. “We need to hear some actual policy things,” said Lewanna Tucker, chair of the Democratic Party in Fulton County, Georgia. “She needs to be letting us a little bit more behind the curtain and talk about structural things that are going to be done.” Perhaps more concrete policy details aren't necessary.

1683,Raducanu doing things 'a little bit differently' before US Open,"Emma Raducanu faces 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin on Tuesday Emma Raducanu says she will always do things ""a little bit differently"" as she prepares for just her second US Open match since winning the title as a teenage qualifier in 2021. The 21-year-old will play American fellow Grand Slam champion Sofia Kenin in the first round on Tuesday, with sixth seed Jessica Pegula a potential second-round opponent for the winner. Raducanu reached the fourth round of Wimbledon in July, but having opted to miss the Olympics, has only played one tournament in the six weeks since. ""I really wanted to play in Toronto, especially because I was born there, but the turnaround was too tight for qualifying,"" she told BBC Sport. ""I would have had to play on Sunday and I finished [in Washington] late Friday night, so flying there and adjusting I just felt was too tight. ""Otherwise, I just always do things a little bit differently."" Raducanu reached the quarter-finals in Washington, where she lost to the eventual champion Paula Badosa. With a trip to Toronto ruled out, Cincinnati was the next opportunity to continue a summer run which has brought 10 wins in her past four tournaments. But a wildcard was not forthcoming, and the world number 71 decided against entering qualifying.  She says she is not averse to playing at that level, although has not done so since winning in New York three years ago. ""I think playing qualies is not something that I am against, because if you get through those two rounds you feel you're adjusted to the court,"" she said. ""If you're playing a seed, you have a better eye for the ball, a better feel - it's not that I am against it at all. ""It was just that I would have pretty much had to wait around just for one tournament in qualies and then another week off before the US Open - so I think it was a better decision we all made to just go back and work on things there."" Raducanu's ranking may soon be high enough to take qualifying out of the equation. And if she stays injury free, then expect her to play a good run of tournaments in Asia in the autumn. Wildcards - should she need them - will be readily available in China because of her heritage, and with her fluent Mandarin and the comfort she finds in her surroundings, it is a good opportunity to finish the season strongly. Raducanu reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in July Raducanu's run to the last 16 at Wimbledon was comfortably her best at a Grand Slam since her US Open triumph. She and Jack Draper are the young British players best placed to fill the void left by Andy Murray, who retired at the Olympics. Raducanu was set to play mixed doubles with three-time Grand Slam champion Murray at Wimbledon, but pulled out when the schedule threatened to compromise her singles aspirations. And at the first major since then, Raducanu says it does not feel any different without the former world number one around. ""Tennis is unforgiving in that sense, no matter who you are,"" she said. ""It just moves on. There's always another match, there's always another tournament. Of course Andy has achieved amazing things - I watched him win this tournament - but it's a fast pace, just like life is. It's old news the next day.""

1703,Ingebrigtsen & Duplantis break world records,"This video can not be played Diamond League Silesia: Jakob Ingebrigtsen breaks 3,000m world record Jakob Ingebrigtsen obliterated the 28-year-old 3,000m world record by more than three seconds before Armand Duplantis broke his own pole vault world record at the Diamond League meeting in Silesia. Norway's Ingebrigtsen looked in disbelief as he crossed the finish line in seven minutes 17.55 seconds, breaking the previous record of 7:20.67 set by Kenya's Daniel Komen in 1996. Komen's time had been the longest-standing men's athletics world record in an individual track event. In the pole vault, Sweden's Duplantis cleared 6.26m, one centimetre higher than his previous best set as he won Olympic gold in Paris earlier this month. His second-attempt clearance on Sunday was the third time the 24-year-old has broken the world record this season, and his 10th overall. Duplantis was joined by American Sam Kendricks and Greece's Emmanouil Karalis - who won Olympic silver and bronze respectively - in jumping 6m. ""This year I focused on the Olympics, the record just came naturally because I was in good shape,"" Duplantis said. ""So I am not surprised with the record today, but I am thankful."" This video can not be played Diamond League Silesia: Armand Duplantis sets new pole vault world record Earlier this week, Ingebrigtsen had exacted a modicum of revenge over American Cole Hocker by winning the 1500m at the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne. The Norwegian lost his Olympic title over the distance to Hocker at Paris 2024, with Great Britain's Josh Kerr second, but won 5,000m gold. The 23-year-old carried that form into Sunday's meet in Poland, although admitted he did not expect his world record time. ""It feels special, amazing. I was hoping to challenge the world record here, but based on my training, I can never predict exactly what kind of time I am capable of,"" he said. ""I would not have imagined I could run 7:17, though. At the beginning the pace felt really fast, but then I started to feel my way into the race and found a good rhythm. ""Now I want to challenge world records at all distances, but it is one step at a time."" Olympic 10,000m silver medallist Berihu Aregawi was second behind Ingebrigtsen in 7:21.28 - the third-fastest time in history - while fellow Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha placed third (7:28.44).  Great Britain's Daryll Neita finished fourth in the women's 100m final in 11.01 seconds, which was an improvement on seventh in the Lausanne meet three days ago. After running a season's-best 10.88 to win Thursday's race, Dina Asher-Smith opted not to compete in Silesia after saying on social media her body needed a ""little rest"".

1708,Ko wins Women's Open to end eight-year major drought,"This video can not be played Watch thrilling finish as Ko wins the Women's Open Final round leaderboard -7 L Ko (NZ); -5 N Korda (US), R Yin (Chn), L Vu (US), Jiyai Shin (Kor) Selected: -1 L Woad (Eng*); +1 C Hull (Eng); +2 G Hall (Eng); +4 L Maguire (Ire) Full leaderboard Lydia Ko ended an eight-year major drought by claiming the AIG Women's Open after a tense finish in blustery conditions at St Andrews. The New Zealander, who won the Olympic gold medal earlier this month, birdied the last as she closed with a three-under-par 69 to win her third major on seven under. Last year's champion Lilia Vu failed to hole a 15-foot birdie putt on the last to force a play-off and then missed from 12 inches to gift Ko a two-shot victory. Vu's 73 saw her finish joint second alongside world number one Nelly Korda, who faded in the closing holes and posted a 72, overnight leader Jiyai Shin (74) and China's Ruoning Yin (70). ""It's surreal,"" said 27-year-old Ko. ""Winning the gold medal in Paris a few weeks ago was almost too good to be true.  ""Heading into the weekend I thought 'how is it possible for me to win The Open?'. It is the most Cinderella-like story, these past two weeks."" England's Lottie Woad won the Smyth Salver as low amateur, birdieing the last to finish on one under. ""It was a little bit of a grind, but I got it done,"" said the 20-year-old, who is the world's best amateur.  ""The Women's Open is the best one to play in. Being at St Andrews, it can't really be any better."" Ko was the youngest woman to win a major when she won the Evian Championship at the age of 18 in 2015.  She followed that with victory in what is now the Chevron Championship in 2016 but, despite having 11 top-10 finishes in the majors since then, she had been unable to add to her tally. And her hopes of doing so on Sunday were in the balance during an intriguing finale with rain and wind battering the Old Course, as it has done all weekend. Ko started three shots behind Shin but birdied the fourth, 10th and 14th holes to put herself firmly in contention. However, Korda looked to have wrestled control with a run of three birdies in four holes around the turn, and she led by two on eight under on the 14th tee. But a couple of poor wedge shots around the green led to the American taking seven shots on the par-five hole.  ""It's golf,"" said Korda. ""Unfortunately I messed up over the weekend twice coming down the stretch. That's what cost me the tournament but I played well."" Meanwhile, Ko, who was playing in a couple of groups ahead, made a terrific up and down for par from the back of 16 to remain at six under.  That made it a four-way tie for the lead with Shin and Vu, who birdied the 14th. As the rain intensified Ko hit arguably the shot of the championship, knocking her second to the notoriously tough 17th to 15 feet and two-putting for par. Her birdie on the last set the target at seven under and she watched from the practice putting green as first Korda, who hit her second shot into the Road Hole bunker, and then Shin, bogeyed the 17th to effectively end their hopes. That left Vu.  The American world number two holed a 10-footer for par on 17 to keep her in the game. But she was unable to match Ko's three up the last and then lost concentration to dribble her par putt wide as she finished with a scruffy bogey. When asked where she would rank this victory alongside her Olympic title and two other majors, Ko replied: ""That's like asking me who I like best, my mum or dad."" England's Charley Hull, who led after round one on five under, started Sunday five shots off the pace but her challenge was sunk by successive bogeys on the sixth and seventh, and a double bogey on the ninth.  Hull, ranked 10th in the world, closed with a three-over 75 and one over total.",2024-08-25 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cje2kj2g3g8o,Peter Scrivener,2024-08-25 23:10:21,,True
1713,Special counsel appeals to resume Trump documents case,"US Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith has appealed to a federal court to resurrect the case against former president Donald Trump for allegedly mishandling classified government documents found at his Florida home in 2021. The case was dismissed in July by Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida, a Trump appointee, who ruled that the mere existence of special counsels violated the US Constitution. In his request on Monday, Mr Smith wrote that the judge's view ""deviated"" from legal precedent and ""took an inadequate account"" of the history of legally-appointed special counsels.  Trump's legal team has until 26 September to submit a response to Mr Smith's arguments. Trump had pleaded not guilty to several felony charges in the now-dismissed case, including wilful retention of national defence information. The 37-count indictment accused Trump of keeping files at his Florida estate and lying to investigators. It also alleged he tried to obstruct the investigation into his handling of the documents. He was charged alongside aide Walt Nauta and former employee Carlos de Oliveira, who had also pleaded not guilty. Mr Smith's request on Monday defended the appointment of special counsels to a federal appeals court in Atlanta. The filing refers to ""Congress's endorsement of that practice through appropriations and other legislation"". ""The attorney general validly appointed the special counsel, who is also properly funded,"" Mr Smith's team said.  ""In ruling otherwise, the district court deviated from binding Supreme Court precedent, misconstrued the statutes that authorized the special counsel's appointment, and took inadequate account of the longstanding history of Attorney General appointments of special counsels."" It noted the landmark 1974 case against former President Richard Nixon, arguing that it proves that the attorney general has ""appointment authority"" for special counsels. ""Nixon conclusively defeats the defendants' challenge to the Special Counsel's appointment, as every other court to have considered the issue has found,"" the filing argued. ""Congress has bestowed on the Attorney General, like the heads of many Executive Departments, broad authority to structure the agency he leads to carry out the responsibilities imposed on him by law,"" Mr Smith's prosecutors wrote. The case was one of four criminal trials Trump was facing. Regardless of how the classified documents case proceeds, it is extremely unlikely to go to trial ahead of the presidential election in November. If Trump wins the election, experts predict that he will order the justice department to dismiss the cases against him. A special counsel has the powers of a US attorney - meaning they can subpoena records and bring criminal charges. They are appointed by attorneys general to facilitate an independent, impartial investigation.  They can also prosecute anyone who interferes in their investigation through crimes including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses. They are not supervised on a day-to-day basis by the justice department, which provides staff to special counsel's office. Mr Trump is not the only notable figure being investigated by a special counsel.  President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is also being prosecuted for gun and tax crimes by a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Mr Garland appointed Mr Smith in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into Mr Trump - the classified documents case and another case arguing that Trump attempted to interfere in the result of the 2020 election. Both cases face uncertain outcomes after the Supreme Court ruled last month that presidents are legally immune from certain actions they take while in office.",2024-08-26 23:11:01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd75g4yrpdo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1711,Trump and Harris spar over muting debate microphones,"The Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns are sparring over whether to mute one of the microphones when it is the other person's turn to speak during the pair's scheduled debate next month. The Harris campaign said in a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News that it wanted both candidates’ microphones to be live throughout the full broadcast. The Trump campaign reportedly wants the ABC debate, scheduled for 10 September, to be governed by the same rules agreed when Joe Biden was the Democratic candidate. That would mean the microphones being muted. The apparent impasse comes as the former president questioned the impartiality of the network and signalled he might even skip the debate. The deadlock in negotiations between the two campaigns was first reported by Politico. Before President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic party nominee, his campaign agreed with Trump's campaign to participate in two debates - one previously held in June on CNN and one to air on ABC News this September.  The Biden campaign negotiated the rules for the debate and agreed that the microphone would be muted when a candidate wasn't speaking.  The Trump campaign agreed to the rule, which was enforced during the June CNN debate.  But now, with just 15 days until the ABC News debate in Philadelphia is scheduled to air, the Harris campaign wants the microphones to be ""hot"" - meaning they will never be turned off for the duration of the debate.  This would allow the two candidates to interrupt and speak over each other on the debate stage. ""The vice president is ready to deal with Trump’s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button,"" Harris campaign senior communications adviser Brian Fallon said in a statement.  Trump, meanwhile, told reporters on Monday that he'd rather have the microphones on during the debate, but said it ""worked out fine"" when they were muted on stage with Mr Biden.  ""We agreed to the same rules and same specifications and I think that's probably what it should be, but they're trying to change it,"" he said. ""The truth is they're trying to get out of it because she doesn't want to debate. She's not a good debater."" Trump's campaign, in a statement to Politico, reiterated the former president's accusation that Ms Harris was looking to find a way to get out of the debate.  “Enough with the games. We accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate,""  senior Trump adviser Jason Miller told Politico.  ""The Harris camp, after having already agreed to the CNN rules, asked for a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements. We said no changes to the agreed upon rules.” A Harris campaign official who was asked about the Trump campaign's claims said they were ""100% false"", according to CBS News.  On Trump's Truth Social platform on Sunday, he questioned whether the ABC News journalists moderating the debate would give the questions to the Harris campaign ahead of time.  ""Why would I do the debate against Kamala Harris on that network?"" he wrote.  This is not the first time the former president has suggested he could back out of a debate. Earlier this month, Trump said he would only debate Ms Harris if the debate was hosted by Fox News. He reversed course several days later. Meanwhile, as the 5 November election nears, the Harris campaign said it has raised $540 million since Biden stepped down, the Associated Press reports. Harris saw record-breaking fundraising numbers in the aftermath of Mr Biden dropping out of the race.   The Trump campaign, on the other hand, raised $138.7 million in July and has $327 million cash on hand.  ",2024-08-26 23:11:01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylj0qg2rwo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

Gauff, 20, began her title defence with a 6-2 6-0 victory in just 66 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium. The American beat Aryna Sabalenka in last year's final to win her first Grand Slam and followed that by reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open this year. But she has struggled for form recently, losing in the third round of the Paris Olympics before suffering early exits at tournaments in Cincinnati and Toronto. Gauff said the past few weeks have ""been a little bit tough"", but she believed her performance against Gracheva was ""the best tennis I have played in a while"". She added that a fan's comment on her TikTok account had helped change her perspective coming into the US Open. ""Someone commented on my TikTok saying you've won in life, literally and figuratively, and there's no point in piling pressure on yourself on a victory lap,"" Gauff said in her on-court interview. ""I'm just treating this tournament like that and if you defend something that means you won something."" Gauff, who fired down 10 aces, broke Gracheva's serve twice in the opening set and won the last nine games on her way to an emphatic victory. She will face German veteran Tatjana Maria in the second round after the 37-year-old moved past Argentine qualifier Solana Sierra 6-2 6-3.

Anisimova raced out to a 5-1 first-set lead but twice failed to serve out the first set, before breaking Zheng for the third time to close it out. But Zheng, a little over three weeks on from her Olympic triumph in Paris, recovered well and served superbly from then on to secure victory. The Chinese seventh seed said it was the ""typical match"" she would have lost in the past, adding that victory was ""one step forward in my mental side"". ""Usually after huge success I will get a little bit too high, and until the reality slap me down again and I come back to the ground,"" Zheng said. ""So this time when I get a success, I'm telling myself, I don't want to let this happen. I'm really happy to get this match, because she's really tough to face."" Daria Kasatkina, the 12th seed, beat Romania's Jaqueline Cristian 6-2 6-4 to progress, while Ukrainian 27th seed Elina Svitolina came through in three sets against Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina.

1733,China's most decorated swimmer back after drugs ban,"China's most decorated swimmer has made a winning return to the pool after serving a controversial four-year drugs ban. Sun Yang won gold in the men's 400m freestyle at China's National Summer Swimming Championships in Hefei on Sunday - and then broke down while speaking to reporters. He had been previously vilified by many in China as a drugs cheat, but his return was praised across state media. His win on Sunday comes shortly after a highly publicised anti-doping row at the Paris Olympics this summer, in which China said its athletes were being unfairly targeted.  In a tearful poolside interview with reporters, the 32-year-old thanked those close to him for helping him get back to competing. “This is really because of the reliance and support from my family -- that's what's kept me going until today,"" he told the South China Morning Post. Sun was suspended by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) in 2020 for refusing to provide samples for testers who had visited his home. In 2012, Sun became China's first male swimmer to win an Olympic gold when he came first in the 400m and 1,500m freestyle races in London. Four years, he followed this up with another gold in the 200m freestyle at the Rio Olympics. But his career came crashing down when anti-doping officials visited his home in 2018 for an out-of-competition test. Sun and his team said the testers lacked the proper accreditation and refused to co-operate with them.  According to the testing team, a member of Sun’s entourage smashed a vial of his blood with a hammer to prevent them from departing with the sample. Sun - who had already been suspended for three months in 2014 for using the banned substance Trimetazidine (TMZ) - denied any wrongdoing and he was initially cleared by swimming's governing body Fina. Two years later, however, CAS overturned the decision and ruled that Sun had refused to cooperate with the sample testers. He was given an eight-year ban, which was later reduced to four years and three months on appeal. As he had never technically tested positive for any banned substances, Sun was allowed to keep all of his medals. His victory on Sunday was widely hailed in Chinese state media outlets, whose posts on social channels were flooded with positive comments. “Brother Sun, don’t cry. The past four years haven’t been easy. You’re amazing,” said one user on Weibo. Another said: ""Congratulations to Sun Yang. Four years and three months of determination and perseverance have all been worth it and have led to this moment. Looking forward to Los Angeles."" Chinese swimmers have been in the spotlight since the Paris Olympics after a slew of doping allegations, followed by contentious US claims that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) was covering it up. Those who headed to Paris were drug-tested twice as much as some other nations, which, in turn, has fuelled accusations of a conspiracy to disrupt their performance. At the time, the state-run Global Times blamed Western powers for ""abusing doping tests to disrupt [the] Chinese swimming team"", while breaststroke champion Qin Haiyang accused opposing teams of using underhand ""tricks"" to disrupt Chinese competitors. In his long-awaited return, Sun represented his home province of Zhejiang - but it is unclear whether he will be allowed to represent China on the international stage. According to the country's anti-doping regulations, athletes who have been banned for more than one year are not eligible to be selected for the national team. Sun insists he will ""go all out"" to compete for a spot in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles - although his performance will need to drastically improve.  His race on Sunday featured no competitors who swam in the Paris Olympics and his time was nearly nine seconds slower than his previous best, which he clocked in London in 2012. “I could have done better. Four years away from competition and without intensive training, I do feel rusty in controlling the tempo, and I need more competitions,"" he told state-run outlet China Daily. ""But it’s a good start for my comeback, and I’m happy with this result,” he added.",2024-08-26 23:11:03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy4pgq1jv8o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1743,Special counsel files reworked indictment against Trump,"US Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith filed a superseding indictment against former president Donald Trump for his alleged attempts to interfere in the 2020 election following his loss to Joe Biden. The new charging document tailors the allegations against Trump to the recent US Supreme Court ruling that presidents are immune from prosecution for certain in-office acts.  The re-tooled indictment maintains four criminal counts against Trump, but it carves out some of the descriptions of his alleged conduct.  Trump has denied the election interference allegations, though he has maintained his claim - without evidence - that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. The new indictment leaves in place the four crimes Trump is accused of committing: Conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights. Trump has previously pleaded not guilty to all charges. The former president's personal lawyer - Todd Blanche - referred the BBC to the Trump campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that the new indictment was ""an effort to resurrect a 'dead' Witch Hunt"" and ""distract the American People"" from the election.  He called for it to be ""dismissed IMMEDIATELY"".  A source close to Trump's legal team told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the new indictment ""was not a surprise"".  ""This is what the government is supposed to do based on what the Supreme Court did,"" the source said. ""It doesn't change our position that we believe Smith's case is flawed and it should be dismissed."" The new charging document - which was slimmed down from 45 to 36 pages - re-works the language of the allegations and refines the ways it argues that the former president allegedly committed these crimes to comport with the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.  For example, the new indictment drops the claim that Trump tried to pressure justice department officials to work to overturn his defeat. The high court ruled that Trump's direction to justice officials was not illegal. The special counsel's office explained the reason for the new indictment in a statement on Tuesday.  “The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States,” the office said.  The justice department declined to comment further.  The new charging document argues that Trump acted as a private citizen - and not as president - when he undertook the alleged scheme to sway the election. “The Defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election,” reads one new line in the indictment. Another new line refers to a lawsuit filed by his campaign in Georgia. The old language said the suit was “filed in his name,” but the new indictment says it was “filed in his capacity as a candidate for President.” The new indictment also appears to have removed the charges against Jeffrey Clark - a former justice department official who played a key role in the so-called fake electors scheme, according to prosecutors. The fake electors scheme was an attempt to interfere in the Electoral College system that decides presidential elections. It centred on an attempt to persuade Republican-controlled state legislatures in seven states to select Republican electors or not name any electors in states that Mr Biden won. The falsified certificates were then transferred to the US Senate in an effort to have their votes counted in the place of the real electors, and overturn Mr Biden's win. Mr Clark was not named in either indictment, but has been identified in the media through public records. The new indictment leaves in place several key allegations against Trump, including that he attempted to persuade Vice-President Mike Pence to obstruct Mr Biden’s election certification. In last month’s Supreme Court ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that any conversations between Trump and Mr Pence would probably fall under the category of official acts. “Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution,” he wrote, adding that it remains to be seen whether the government can rebut “that presumption of immunity”. The new indictment shows that Mr Smith interpreted the US Supreme Court ruling to mean that his case could still move forward, said Daniel Charles Richman, a constitutional law expert at Columbia Law School. But whether it would satisfy the Supreme Court's presidential immunity framework remains unclear, the law professor said, as ""the Court was painfully vague as to what private conduct done by a president can be charged criminally"". The new indictment would not necessarily expedite the case, either, Mr Richman told the BBC. He doubted that it would be heard before the election.  The CBS News source close to Trump's legal team said that the former president's lawyers would ask for more time to prepare for the case. They said it would likely delay the start of the trial if the judge agrees.  This case came together after Mr Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into Trump: The election interference case and another case accusing the ex-president of taking classified documents back to his Florida home after leaving office. On Monday, Mr Smith’s team appealed against a Florida judge's decision to dismiss the confidential documents case. “The district court deviated from binding Supreme Court precedent, misconstrued the statutes that authorized the special counsel's appointment, and took inadequate account of the longstanding history of Attorney General appointments of special counsels,"" the special counsel’s team wrote in their appeal. Both cases face uncertain futures after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision last month. If Trump wins over Democrat Kamala Harris, he is widely expected to order the justice department to drop all the federal charges that he faces.",2024-08-27 23:10:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdpq4en1vvo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1756,Top-level meeting shows China - and Xi - still a priority for Biden,"Jake Sullivan has been welcomed to China on his first visit as US national security adviser. He will hold talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi as the two countries try to stabilise relations. Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have met four times over 16 months in Vienna, Malta, Washington and Bangkok. Their last meeting in January was shortly after a high-stakes summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden that sought to reset frosty ties.  This week's talks - scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday - signal that China is still a priority for the Biden administration, even as the retiring president enters his final  months in office.  Both Mr Sullivan and Mr Wang have already acknowledged a need to find common ground after disagreements between their nations. Could another presidential summit be on the cards?  The White House is trying not to explicitly link Mr Sullivan's trip to the US presidential election. But it's hard to ignore the timing.  If Mr Sullivan is able to lay the groundwork for a final Biden-Xi summit, his trip would tie up the ends of the US president's most consequential - and fraught - foreign policy relationship.  US and Chinese diplomats always acknowledge that talks between Washington and Beijing are never easy. And there is a lot to talk about.  With the unexpected turn the US election has taken with Biden bowing out in favour of Kamala Harris, China is watching closely for what the next presidency might have in store. Donald Trump has made it clear he will raise tariffs further on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the trade war he kicked off in 2019.  While Mr Biden's administration saw merit in diplomacy, he didn't reverse Trump-era tariffs and has added more - in May he announced steep duties on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, and steel.   Mr Biden has also strengthened alliances across Asia to combat China’s rising influence and beefed up Washington’s military presence - which, in turn, has rattled Beijing.    So far, the Harris campaign has not given many clues about how she plans to manage the relationship with China.  And the White House has made clear that Mr Sullivan's visit is meant to continue the work of the Biden administration, rather than set the tone for the next president. But China is likely looking ahead anyway.  Beijing will use this opportunity with Mr Sullivan to clarify its own priorities. It will hope that all parties in America are listening - China's ministry of foreign affairs has described this as a “critical juncture” between the world’s two biggest economies. For China, the red line is and always will be Taiwan. It claims the self-governing island and has repeatedly said it will not tolerate any signs that Washington is encouraging Taiwanese independence.  High-profile diplomatic visits, such as a controversial one by then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022, or recognition of Taiwan's elections or its elected leaders, fall into that category.   Chinese state media has said Beijing will focus on expressing grave concerns, stating its position, and making serious demands on matters such as the ""Taiwan question"". China will also have some strong words for Mr Sullivan on trade. Beijing has described US tariffs on Chinese goods as “unreasonable” and has urged Washington to ""stop politicising and securitising economic and trade issues"" and ""take more measures to facilitate people-to-people exchanges between the two countries"". When he came to power, Mr Biden wanted to set ties with China on an even keel after what he saw as the chaos and unpredictability of the Trump White House.  His administration has wanted to “responsibly manage” rivalry with Beijing; to demonstrate American power and competition with China through stealth not bravado. But that strategy has been upended amid the turbulence of events.  Last year, crisis engulfed the direct relationship when an American fighter jet shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over US territory.  The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have further sharpened the tone.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing in April with a warning -   Washington would act if China did not stop supplying Russia with microchips and machine parts to build weapons used in its war in Ukraine.  He accused his Chinese counterparts of ""helping to fuel the biggest threat"" to European security since the Cold War. His warning materialised with a raft of sanctions on Chinese firms over their alleged support of the Russian military.  This is a tricky subject that China keeps trying to bat away, but Washington is insistent, and Mr Sullivan is likely to bring it up again. China's increasing assertiveness in Asia has also made the US wary of the impact of those ties further afield - particularly with Iran, which allies itself with Moscow and also arms Israel’s adversaries.  Finally, in America, there is the devastating domestic impact of Chinese-manufactured ""pre-cursor"" chemicals to make synthetic opioids like fentanyl, overdoses of which are killing more Americans than ever and the crisis has laid waste to entire towns. Last year’s summit between Mr Biden and Mr Xi in San Fransisco was meant to make progress on these issues.  Since then, despite the tariffs and the stern rhetoric, Washington and Beijing have acknowledged their differences - and reports of the two sides striking a deal on curbing fentanyl production are a good sign. In April, when the BBC accompanied US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his visit to Shanghai and Beijing, the public elements of some of his meetings with senior Chinese officials felt like a steely stand-off.  It was a show of diplomatic strength meant for each side's domestic audience. And this will undoubtedly be a part of Mr Sullivan’s trip too, as he tries to bolster Mr Biden's diplomacy in the waning months of his presidency.  But these meetings serve another fundamental purpose - face-to-face time between two rival, inter-dependent economies as they battle mutual distrust and try to probe each other’s real intentions. It seems that Jake Sullivan's previous meetings with Wang Yi have quietly laid the groundwork for what both sides call “stable relations”. In a recent speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington, Mr Sullivan said that he and Mr Wang had ""increasingly gotten to the point of setting aside the talking points and really having strategic conversations”. He described the character of those conversations as “direct”, including one on the war in Ukraine.  ""Both of us left feeling that we didn’t agree or see eye-to-eye on everything but that there was a lot of work to carry forward.”",2024-08-27 23:10:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg58m308glro,Unknown,Unknown,,True

A short time later in New York, 25th seed Draper cruised through when Chinese number one Zhang Zhizhen retired with a knee injury as the Briton led 6-3 6-0 4-0. Fellow Britons Dan Evans and Emma Raducanu are hoping to join the pair in the second round when they complete their opening matches later on Tuesday. Evans, 34, faces Russian Karen Khachanov as he aims to find joy in a difficult year, which has brought wins in just four singles matches on the ATP Tour. Raducanu, 21, aims for her first victory at the US Open since lifting the 2021 title when she plays American Sofia Kenin. US Open: GB's Boulter into decider, Evans in action - radio & text Swiatek made to work hard in victory over lucky loser Boulter has leapt up the rankings after a strong 18 months where she has stayed fit and caused problems for opponents with her powerful game. Now, she is aiming to break another ceiling by reaching the second week of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time. But coming into the US Open, Boulter admitted she was not as prepared as she might have been for the hard courts because of her participation in the Paris Olympics which was played on clay. That experience meant she played just three completed matches on hard courts before starting her campaign at Flushing Meadows. In contrast, Sasnovich was match sharp having come through qualifying without dropping a set. The difference showed in an opening set where Boulter struggled to land first serves and paid the price as she was broken three times, undoing the good work she had done to twice take Sasnovich's unorthodox serve. The Belarusian's eye-catching motion, striking a pose like a flamenco dancer with her serving arm aloft before tossing the ball, looks awkward and lacked ferocity. Boulter was able to break four times which, in conjunction with more solidity in her service games, allowed the Briton to confidently roll through the next two sets. ""It's not easy coming out here to play your first round against someone who has been top 30 - she knows how to play tennis,"" Boulter, who reached the third round last year, told Sky Sports. ""I knew it would be a battle, she's played three matches on these courts. ""I'm super proud I managed to stay in there and bring a good level to the court."" Draper has long been seen as the successor to the recently retired Andy Murray as Britain's greatest hope at the top end of the men's game. Possessing a huge serve and explosive groundstrokes, the 22-year-old left-hander has climbed the rankings after finding more consistency this year and winning his first ATP title in Stuttgart in June. Now he is aiming to go even further on the sport's biggest stages as the post-Murray era begins at the US Open. Draper reached the fourth round last year in a career-best performance at a major and warmed up for another crack at going deep in New York with an encouraging run to the Cincinnati quarter-finals. Zhang, a towering figure who boasts a powerful game, was expected to provide a stern test. Draper dominated his service games in a confident start before taking advantage of Zhang's fitness issues. Breaking for a 3-2 lead put him charge of the opening set and, with Zhang twice needing treatment, remained focused to win 13 of what proved to be the final 14 games.

1782,Trump campaign and Arlington Cemetery staff clash at event,"A wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery turned contentious when former President Donald Trump's campaign staff got into an ""altercation"" with cemetery staff over filming at the burial site for military members.  Cemetery officials publicly offered few details beyond saying ""there was an incident"" and a ""report was filed"".  The incident, first reported by NPR, occurred when a campaign staffer attempted to film in a restricted area and a cemetery employee tried to stop them.  The Trump campaign denied the allegations and said they received permission from families of fallen service members to film, though federal law prohibits political campaign activity on the grounds of military cemeteries. Trump was at the memorial to honour the 13 US military service members who were killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago Monday.  An unnamed source told NPR that Trump staffers were attempting to film and photograph a section of the cemetery where the recent US casualties are buried.  Federal law restricts recording there. Trump staffers were told beforehand that they could not photograph or film that part of the grounds, cemetery officials said.  When the cemetery employee tried to stop the campaign from entering that section, campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the official aside, the unnamed source told NPR.  Defence officials told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that some Trump campaign staff were unprofessional and both verbally and physically aggressive towards the cemetery official.  Trump's campaign has denied NPR's version of the story.  Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, disputed that there was a physical altercation and said the campaign is prepared to release video to confirm their account. ""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony,"" he said in a statement. In a post on Truth Social, Trump shared a statement from family members of the fallen soldiers honoured at the event, expressing their approval. “We had given our approval for President Trump’s official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured and so we can cherish these memories forever,” the families said in Trump's Truth Social post.  But that goes against federal policy, an Arlington National Cemetery spokesperson told the BBC.  Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities on the grounds of military cemeteries, including photographers, content creators or anyone directly supporting a partisan political candidate's campaign, the cemetery spokesperson said.  Arlington National Cemetery said it would not be releasing further information or the identity of the worker involved in order to protect the person. The Trump campaign shared some footage of the visit on social media on Tuesday, but the alleged ""altercation"" was not included in the video.

1781,Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first  major interview?,"Three weeks ago, just days after being formally chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was pressed on her plans for a sit-down interview. “I’ve talked to my team,” she told reporters on the airport tarmac in Detroit. “I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” On Thursday night, Ms Harris will - just barely - make good on that promise, sitting down with CNN’s Dana Bash for her first major interview. But Ms Harris will not be there by herself. The vice-president will be joined by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for the prime-time appearance, airing  at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST). Ms Harris may have answered the question of when she would conduct an in-depth, substantive discussion of her candidacy and agenda - standard procedure for all major party presidential candidates. But with Mr Walz in tow, the decision to make this a joint appearance may also fuel growing criticism that after escaping the rigours of a months-long presidential primary, she is now dodging the scrutiny that comes with a solo interview. “I think it’s incredibly weak, weak sauce, to show up with your running mate,” said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W Bush, on CNN, adding that Harris had a “troubling lack of confidence"" in her own political ability. But supporters of Ms Harris insist that given the unprecedented nature of her candidacy following President Joe Biden's sudden departure from the race, she is taking things at a smart pace. “I think the cadence has been right,” said Peter Giangreco, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. “Win the nomination, pick your nominee, lay out your economic plan, do your convention and now do some sit-downs and amplify that.” Joint interviews featuring both members of a presidential ticket are not unusual.  Barack Obama and Joe Biden sat for an interview with 60 minutes after Mr Biden was selected as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Eight years later, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did the same. For Ms Harris and Mr Biden in 2020, they picked ABC’s 20/20. And less than a week after Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the pair were jointly interviewed on Fox. But since Mr Biden passed the torch to her late last month, Ms Harris has limited most of her engagement with the press to scripted and highly-controlled environments. Her last formal sit-down interview was on 24 June, more than two months and a political lifetime ago. Her occasional interactions with reporters - brief answers to shouted questions on her way to and from campaign events - have done little to quell Republican claims that she is shirking any opportunity to have her record and agenda put under the microscope. The harshest criticism comes from her Republican opponents, who have both given several interviews in the past month. “She’s not smart enough to do a news conference,” Mr Trump told media earlier in August. “She won’t do interviews with friendly people because she can’t do better than Biden.”  The Democratic nominee has enjoyed a surge in momentum since entering the race. Now, after her whirlwind introduction to American voters, she needs to ""reinforce"" that energy, said Republican strategist and Trump critic Chip Felkel.  “She’s gotta get out there,” he said. “She’s got to show that she can think under pressure, because that’s part of what the president has to do.” By doing a joint interview, the Harris campaign may have calculated that the pressure - and the difficult questions - will at least be shared between the two of them. And it ensures both are in lockstep when it comes to explaining policy. Mr Giangreco, the Democratic strategist, predicted Ms Harris and Mr Walz will try to turn the focus onto their economic plan, an agenda to lower the cost of living and provide economic security that she first announced at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, two weeks ago. Mr Giangreco also pointed to another potential benefit of a joint interview: drawing a contrast between Mr Walz and his Republican counterpart JD Vance who he has labelled as ""weird"". Still, the real impact of Ms Harris and Mr Walz’s sit-down won’t be known until it is done. Ms Harris’s record with high-pressure interviews is mixed. A 2021 conversation with NBC’s Lester Holt, in which she fumbled through questions about her role in the administration’s border policy, was widely regarded as a failure. But in a more recent appearance, a one-on-one with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, in which she defended Mr Biden’s calamitous debate performance, Ms Harris looked calm and confident amid a political firestorm. If this high-stakes CNN joint interview falls into the latter category, then the Harris campaign will hope much of the criticism will fall away, said Mr Felkel, the Republican strategist. “They just need to be able to say ‘See, we told you,’” he said. “And then keep moving.”",2024-08-28 23:11:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3d72dxe5zo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1778,"FBI: Trump gunman acted alone, but motive still unknown","US authorities said that the man who attempted to kill former President Donald Trump acted alone and there is no sign of foreign involvement. But FBI officials stressed at a news briefing on Wednesday that a motive for the assassination attempt remains unknown, and they said that Thomas Crooks - the 20-year-old assailant - had a ""mixture of ideologies"". The law enforcement agency described Crooks's search history, and it released photos of the gun he used and the improvised explosive devices found in his car. Crooks attempted to shoot the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July. He grazed Trump’s ear, killed one man and seriously injured two others. Kevin Rojek, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said that Crooks began searching online for Trump campaign events starting in September 2023. He searched for events for both Trump and President Joe Biden, who was still the Democratic nominee at the time of the shooting. He also looked for the location of both the Republican and Democratic national conventions. “When… the Trump rally was announced early in July, he became hyper-focused on that specific event and looked at it as a target of opportunity,” Mr Rojek said. Crooks registered for the Trump rally one week in advance, Mr Rojek said. On the same day, the 20-year-old searched how far assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was from John F Kennedy when the Marine veteran fatally shot the US president in 1963.  Crooks also looked up “Where will Trump speak from at Butler Farm Show?” - the site of the rally. His search history showed that he had attempted to find bomb making instructions and ingredients as well, authorities said. ""We believe the subject engaged in detailed attack planning,"" Mr Rojek said.  FBI officials said Crooks’s online activities showed a “mixture of ideologies” and that they are continuing to look into his online presence. “We see no definitive ideology associated with our subject, either left leaning or right leaning,” Mr Rojek said. Crooks was a registered Republican. In 2021, he donated $15 to liberal campaign group ActBlue. Officials said that some anti-Semitic comments online “were associated with accounts associated with [Crooks]” and that they were working to determine whether he wrote them. The FBI has previously said that Crooks had at least two social media accounts which showed contradictory ideological views. The content of the accounts has not been made public. At the Butler rally, Crooks was on the roof of a nearby building for about six minutes. He fired eight shots at Trump, who was speaking on a stage, before a Secret Service sniper killed him.  During Wednesday's news conference, FBI officials also responded to criticism by conservatives, including Republican Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana, that the agency had cleaned up the crime scene and returned Crooks’s body to his family too quickly. Mr Rojek said that standard procedures were followed in the clean up of the site, that Crooks’s body was returned after an autopsy was completed and that it is not standard procedure to retain human remains indefinitely. The autopsy indicated that Crooks had no trace of illegal drugs or alcohol in his system. The FBI said that the Crooks family has co-operated with their investigation. A Congressional task force including both Republicans and Democrats is in the process of investigating the security failures that led to the shooting. Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service at the time of the shooting, stepped down from her position last month after facing intense pressure from lawmakers.  She has since been replaced by Ronald Rowe as acting director. At least five Secret Service agents have been placed on administrative leave following the security lapse.  Last week, Trump held an outdoor rally in North Carolina - his first since the assassination attempt. He appeared behind a podium surrounded by bulletproof glass.

1777,2024 Paralympics opening ceremony lights up Paris,"The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games opening ceremony concluded with a dazzling firework display A spectacular opening ceremony marked the start of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games as athletes paraded along the iconic Champs-Elysees to Place de la Concorde in glorious conditions. As with the Olympic Games, the Paralympics opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in the French capital. The main ceremony was staged at Place de la Concorde, on a perfect summer evening in the heart of the city, following a parade along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees from the iconic Arc de Triomphe. Organisers estimated 65,000 people would be present, with spectators able to watch the parade for free before the ticketed open-air event. The first of 11 days of sporting action takes place on Thursday as France hosts a summer Paralympic Games for the first time. About 4,400 athletes from a record 168 delegations are set to take part in the 22 Paralympic sports, competing for a total of 549 gold medals in Paris. Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, said the opening ceremony represented the start of ""the Paralympic revolution"" led by the athletes. ""What makes you revolutionaries is that, when they told you 'no', you continued,"" Estanguet said. ""Tonight, you are inviting us to change our perspectives, change our attitudes, change our society to finally give every person their full place. ""Every emotion that you make us feel will carry a message that will never be forgotten: You have no limits, so let us stop imposing limits on you."" France's delegation arrived at the Place de la Concorde to a huge ovation Artistic director Thomas Jolly had promised the opening ceremony would be ""a spectacle that will showcase the Paralympic athletes and the values that they embody"". The staging of the event at the Place de la Concorde - the largest square in Paris - was designed as a symbol of the city putting the issue of inclusion for people with disabilities at the heart of society. While the Olympic Games had athletes travelling on boats down the River Seine in torrential rain, the opening ceremony for the Paralympic Games saw a parade take place on the route along the Champs-Elysees under golden skies. The delegations made their way along the Champs-Elysees to Place de la Concorde French former Paralympic swimmer Theo Curin was the star of the opening segment, transporting athletes in a taxi decorated by Phryges - the Paris 2024 mascot adapted for the Paralympics with a running blade. A series of artistic displays featuring performers with disabilities and impairments highlighted societal issues around inclusivity, the paradox of a world claiming to be inclusive but which remains full of prejudice a central theme. Blue, white and red smoke of the Tricolore was released by the Patrouille de France aerial display before the athletes made their entrance, while French singer Christine and the Queens also took to the main stage at the Place de la Concorde. A series of artistic performances marked the start of the opening ceremony British prime minister Keir Starmer was in attendance to welcome the ParalympicsGB delegation in to a party atmosphere, where the athletes arrived against the backdrop of a setting sun behind the Arc de Triomphe. Wheelchair tennis athlete Lucy Shuker and wheelchair basketball player Terry Bywater, contesting their fifth and seventh Games respectively, carried the British flag for ParalympicsGB after being voted as flagbearers by their team-mates. Sprinter Nantenin Keita and Para-triathlete Alexis Hanquinquant were on flag duties for host nation France, the final delegation to enter the Place de la Concorde, soaking up huge applause amid a rendition of Les Champs-Elysees. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Great Britain's paralympians arrive at the opening ceremony Following speeches by Estanguet and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons, French president Emmanuel Macron declared the Games officially open. Parsons said: ""The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games will show persons with disabilities what they can achieve at the highest level. ""The fact that these opportunities largely exist only in sport in the year 2024 is shocking. It is proof that we can and must do more to advance disability. ""That is why 225 years on from when Place de la Concorde was central to the French Revolution, I hope that Paris 2024 starts a Paralympic revolution - the inclusion revolution."" Twelve Paralympic champions formed part of the Paralympic flame parade, as it was transported to the Jardin des Tuileries. There the cauldron was lit by flagbearers Keita and Hanquinquant, Charles Antoine Kouakou, Fabien Lamirault and Elodie Lorandi, before being raised into the sky as the ceremony concluded with an eye-catching firework display. IPC president Parsons said in the lead-up to the Games that he believes Paris will deliver ""the most spectacular Paralympic Games ever"". Two million tickets have been sold, with about 500,000 still available. Many venues used during the Olympic Games are again in use for the Paralympics, with the athletics taking place at Stade de France, swimming at La Defense Arena, wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros and Para-equestrian at Chateau de Versailles. The Para-triathlon will take place in the centre of Paris, with the swim leg set to be held in the River Seine after the men's Olympic triathlon was delayed by a day and training sessions were cancelled because of poor water quality. As in the Olympics, Russia and ally Belarus are banned amid the ongoing war in Ukraine but some athletes from those nations are allowed to participate as part of a Neutral Paralympic Athletes (NPA) delegation. Eritrea, Kiribati and Kosovo will be represented in the Paralympics for the first time, while eight athletes will compete for the Paralympic Refugee Team. A team of 215 athletes will represent ParalympicsGB, with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport. Channel 4 will show the Games in the UK while BBC Radio 5 Live will have commentary, updates and dedicated programmes, and the BBC Sport website will have daily live text commentary. There are 22 gold medals to be won on the opening day - and no shortage of opportunities for ParalympicsGB to earn medals on day one. Find full details of the schedule in our day-by-day guide.

1784,What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics?,"The Paris Paralympics are fast approaching and you can plan how to follow the 11 days of competition with our day-by-day guide - all times BST. A team of 215 athletes will represent ParalympicsGB in the French capital with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport.  At the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, held in 2021, the GB team finished second behind China in the medal table with 124 medals, including 41 golds. The Games start with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, 28 August, with the first medals to be decided the following day and action continuing until the closing ceremony on Sunday, 8 September. Medal events: 22 Para-cycling track (women's C4-5 500m time trial, C1-3 3,000m individual pursuit, men's B 4,000m individual pursuit, C1 3,000m individual pursuit); Para-swimming (men's S9 400m freestyle, S1 100m backstroke, S2 100m backstroke, S14 100m butterfly, SB3 50m breaststroke, S10 50m freestyle, S13 100m butterfly, S5 200m freestyle; women's S9 400m freestyle, S2 100m backstroke, S14 100m butterfly, S6 50m freestyle, S10 50m freestyle, S13 100m butterfly, S5 200m freestyle); Para-taekwondo (women K44 -47kg, K44 -52kg; men K44 -58kg) All eyes will be on where Britain’s first gold of the Games will come from and there are plenty of chances on the opening day of competition. The velodrome was a happy hunting ground for the GB team at the Olympics and the Paralympic team will hope for similar. Kadeena Cox, who created history in Rio by winning golds in both cycling and athletics, goes in the women’s C4-5 500m time trial (qualifying 11:00; final 14:50), aiming to retain her title after a turbulent build-up which has included a calf injury and a relapse of her MS. Games debutant Daphne Schrager is a strong medal contender in the C1-3 individual pursuit (qualifying 11:58; final 15:29). She is world champion in the C2 division but the Paris event is a combined one. And don’t rule out the tandem pair of Steve Bate and Chris Latham in the B individual pursuit (qualifying 12:41; final 16:13) – they are world silver medallists while Bate previously won gold and silver in the event with his former pilot Adam Duggleby. Wheelchair rugby player Stuart Robinson will be aiming for another Paralympic gold At the pool, both William Ellard and Olivia Newman-Baronius won gold in May’s Open European Championships in Madeira in their respective S14 butterfly finals and will be hoping to claim their first Paralympic medals (17:35 and 17:42) with Newman-Baronius facing a stiff challenge from team-mate Poppy Maskill. Tully Kearney won silver in the S5 200m freestyle in Tokyo, finishing just 0.12 seconds behind China’s Zhang Li, and will be hoping to go one better in the final at 19:45. The GB wheelchair rugby team will start the defence of their title with a tricky-looking tie against world champions and world number one-ranked Australia (10:30), while it is also the opening day of the wheelchair basketball with the GB men, who have won bronze at four of the past five Games, starting against Germany (09:30) and the women up against Spain (11:45). And archer Jodie Grinham, who is seven months pregnant, gets her women’s individual compound open competition under way with the ranking round (12:00) before the knockout starts on Friday. We could see one of the final Games appearances of a Paralympic great on day one in Paris. Spanish swimmer Teresa Perales made her debut in Sydney in 2000 and has 27 Paralympic medals over her career to make her the country’s most successful Paralympian. Now 48, she will be aiming to make the final in the S2 100m backstroke (heats 09:26; final 17:10) where Singapore’s Yip Pin Xiu is favourite for gold. Belarusian swimmer Ihar Boki, who will be competing as a Neutral Paralympic Athlete, has been the dominant figure in the S13 division with 16 gold medals and will be chasing a fourth title in a row in the 100m butterfly (19:03) with Alex Portal leading home hopes. And the first member of the Paralympic Refugee team will be in action when Zakia Khudadadi takes to the mat in the K44 -47kg taekwondo event (bouts from 09:00; final 19:34). Born in Afghanistan, she represented her country in Tokyo after being safely evacuated in the days prior to the Games. Since then, she has been based in France and won gold in her division at last year’s European Championships. Wheelchair rugby was originally called murderball and was developed in Canada in the 1970s by athletes with quadriplegia. It was a demonstration sport in Atlanta in 1996 with the first medals awarded in Sydney four years later. Medal events: 42 Para-cycling track (men's C4-5 1,000m time trial, C2 3,000m individual pursuit, C3 3,000m individual pursuit; women’s C4 3,000m individual pursuit, B 1,000m time trial); Para-swimming (men's S5 100m freestyle, S4 100m freestyle, SM6 200m IM, S11 400m freestyle, SB9 100m breaststroke, S13 100m backstroke, SB8 100m breaststroke; women's S5 100m freestyle, SM6 200m IM, S11 400m freestyle, SB9 100m breaststroke, S13 100m backstroke, SB8 100m breaststroke; mixed 20 point 4x50m freestyle); Para-taekwondo (men’s K44 -63kg, K44 -70kg; women’s K44 -57kg , K44-65kg); Para table tennis (women’s doubles WD14, WD5); Shooting Para Sport (R2 - women's 10m AR standing SH1, P1 - men's 10m air pistol SH1, R4 - Mixed 10m air rifle standing SH2); Para-athletics (women's F55 discus, F41 shot put, T11 long jump, T35 100m, F32 club throw, T52 400m, T37 100m, T47 100m, F37 shot put; men's T11 5000m, F38 javelin, T11 long jump, F55 shot put, T37 200m) It is set to be another busy day at the swimming pool for the British team. Maisie Summers-Newton took over the mantle of Ellie Simmonds by winning the SM6 200m individual medley in Tokyo and is strong favourite to maintain her dominance and retain her title (17:01), having lowered her own world record in May. Another Tokyo defending champion Tully Kearney will aim to make it back-to-back wins in the S5 100m freestyle (16:37) with team-mate Suzanna Hext also hoping to feature. The SB8 100m breaststroke (19:12) looks to be a fascinating encounter with Britain’s Brock Whiston going in fastest but Ireland’s defending champion Ellen Keane, in her final race before retiring, and 16-year-old world champion Anastasiya Dmytriv of Spain are big dangers. At the velodrome, Jody Cundy goes for gold in his eighth Paralympics in the C4-5 1,000m time trial (qualifying 10:30, final 13:52) after switching his bike for the dancefloor and Strictly Come Dancing last year. Cundy, who is a C4 rider, will be competing against less-impaired C5 riders, including Spanish defending champion Alfonso Cabello, and will need to get somewhere close to his own world record to win a ninth Paralympic gold. Maisie Summers-Newton is competing at her second Games after making her GB debut in 2018 In the men’s C3 3,000m individual pursuit (qualfifying 12:27, final 15:26), defending champion Jaco van Gass and silver medallist Fin Graham will hope to battle it out for gold again and in the women’s B time trial (qualifying 12:58, final 15:34), 2023 world champions Sophie Unwin and pilot Jenny Holl and the 2024 world champions Lizzi Jordan and Danni Khan will aim to be in the final shake-up. After winning silver on her Paralympic debut in Tokyo, taekwondo star Beth Munro will aim to go one better in the K44 -65kg division (final 21:28) while 14-year-old table tennis player Bly Twomey and Fliss Pickard could figure in the women’s doubles WD14 decider (19:00) and shooter Ryan Cockbill will aim for success in the R4 mixed 10m air rifle event (qualifying 12:30, final 15:15). And archer Jodie Grinham, who is competing in Paris while seven months pregnant, and team-mate and defending champion Phoebe Patterson Pine will hope to progress into the last 16 of the women’s individual compound event (08:00). The opening day of athletics will see 12 gold medals awarded – the first could go to Brazil in the T11 5000m (09:05) with Yeltsin Jacques a strong contender but Japan’s Kenya Karasawa is a threat. Tunisian Raoua Tlili will be bidding for her third F41 shot put title in a row (09:35) – an event where she is also world champion. The women’s and men’s T11 long jump competitions both take place on day one (09:49 and 18:00). Competitors wear blindfolds and have to rely on audio indications from their guide, who stands near the sand. The stadium is also silent as the athletes leap into the unknown. And Brazil’s Petrucio Ferreira, the fastest Paralympian in the world, will be hoping to retain his T47 100m title (18:30). He won world gold in 2023 and '24 and his world record stands at 10.29 seconds. Lizzi Jordan is making her Paralympic debut for GB seven years after losing her sight, and almost her life, from suspected food poisoning.  The illness left her in a coma and after she came out of it, she had to learn how to walk again as well as dealing with the impact of her sight loss.

Neil and pilot Matt Rotherham are world champions in the B 1,000m time trial (final 12:51) with team-mates James Ball and Steffan Lloyd likely to be a big danger. Lora and Corrine Hall will also face a tough challenge in the B 3,000m individual pursuit (qualifying 10:22, final 13:31) against world champions and team-mates Lizzi Jordan and Danni Khan and the 2023 world champions Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl.

The Fachies have been juggling cycling and parenthood since the birth of son Fraser It is an early start for the triathletes with seven of the 11 classes down for decision (from 07:15). The races start in the River Seine which was at the centre of controversy during the Olympics over its water quality with training cancelled and the men's race delayed by a day. The rivalry between former swimming team-mates Lauren Steadman and Claire Cashmore will continue in the PTS5 event (09:20) – the British pair won gold and bronze in Tokyo with American Grace Norman, the Rio champion, finishing second.

The home crowd will be cheering on French triathlete Alexis Hanquinquant as he hopes to continue his dominance in the PTS4 event (09:15). Hanquinquant, who had his leg amputated in 2013 after a work accident, was always a keen sportsman and made his Paralympic debut in Tokyo, finishing almost four minutes clear of his nearest rival, and is the man to beat in the division. American high jumper Roderick Townsend is the star of the T47 event and he goes for a third title in a row (18:28). After the retirement of 18:47) Ireland’s Jason Smyth, there will be a new champion in the T13 100m (with Tokyo runner-up Skander Djamil Athmani of Algeria and the T12 gold medallist Salum Ageze Kashafali of Norway bidding to lead the charge. Lauren Rowles started her sporting career as a wheelchair racer before switching to rowing in 2015 and winning gold at the Rio Paralympics the next year with Laurence Whiteley.  In March, her partner Jude Hamer, who has represented GB in wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics, gave birth to their son Noah and Rowles has been passionate in speaking about sexuality, diversity and representation.

In the same session, Jack Shephard and Rachel Choong will hope to figure in the SH6 mixed doubles decider with all GB athletes chasing their nation’s first gold medal in the sport. The second day of the triathlon sees four more golds and Dave Ellis and guide Luke Pollard will bid to make up for Tokyo heartbreak where they went in as favourites in the men’s PTVI event (09:00) but suffered a mechanical failure on the bike leg which ended their race. In the women’s PTVI (09:10), Alison Peasgood won silver in Rio but was fourth in Tokyo. She is back at the top level after having son Logan last August and will be aiming to impress again with guide Brooke Gillies. Ellis was a Para-swimmer before switching to Para-triathlon Ellie Challis was Britain’s youngest medallist at the Tokyo Games when she won silver in the S3 50m backstroke in Tokyo aged 17 and she will hope to go one better this time (17:05) while Louise Fiddes has a good medal chance in the SB14 100m breaststroke (17:20). At the Stade de France, the Blade Runners take centre stage with the men’s T63 and T64 100m finals (19:37 and 20:35). Can Jonnie Peacock win a third gold medal?

Italy’s Valentina Petrillo, who is believed to be the first openly transgender athlete to compete at the Paralympics, will start her campaign in the T12 400m (heats 09:45; semi-final 19:37) – an event where she won bronze at last year’s World Championships in Paris. While Hannah Cockroft has dominated the women’s T34 100m, Tunisia’s Walid Ktila has the same standing in the men’s T34 sprint and he will chase a fourth consecutive title (10:11).

Dimitri Coutya and Piers Gilliver have been leading the GB wheelchair fencing challenge and they start their busy programmes with the sabre B (19:50) and sabre A (20:40) events while Gemma Collis will go in the women’s sabre A (21:05) And the men’s wheelchair basketball reaches the quarter-final stage (from 13:45) as the GB team bid to claim another medal. In athletics, expect plenty of interest around the women’s T12 400m final (11:10), which could feature Italian transgender sprinter Valentina Petrillo. Los Angeles teenager Ezra Frech will be aiming to win Paralympic gold aged 19 in the T63 men’s high jump (19:20) and he is also tipped to be one of the faces of the 2028 Games, while his 20-year-old team-mate Jaydin Blackwell is the favourite for the T38 400m (18:21). Swiss pair Catherine Debrunner and Manuela Schaer should be among the leading figures in the women’s T54 1500m (11:20) And Italian swimmers Carlotta Gilli and Stefano Raimondi will be key medal hopes for their nation in the women’s SM13 200m IM (18:59) and men’s S10 butterfly (19:28) respectively.

The 17-time gold medallist across swimming and cycling opted out of the track programme to concentrate on the road and she starts her campaign for gold number 18 in the C5 time trial (from 07:00) – an event where she has won gold at every Games since her cycling debut in 2008. The women’s B time trial could also be a good one for GB with Tokyo silver medallists Lora Fachie and Corrine Hall and the 2023 world silver medallists Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl aiming for gold. Ben Watson, Jaco van Gass and Fin Graham will be aiming for a clean sweep in the men’s C3 time trial while Archie Atkinson will be chasing hard in the C4 event.

Kinghorn won world gold in 2023 but China’s Fang Gao and Hongzhuan Zhou and Switzerland’s Catherine Debrunner will be big dangers. Another Scot Stephen Clegg should be among the main challengers in the S12 100m freestyle final (16:30) while Poppy Maskill and Olivia Newman-Baronius are the fastest two in the world this year in the SM14 200m IM (16:51) and Rhys Darbey and William Ellard could figure in the men’s race (16:43).

Rehm, who lost his right leg below the knee in a wakeboarding accident in 2003 and jumps using a bladed prosthesis, has been the star of Para-athletics, constantly pushing the boundaries of his event. However, he is unable to compete at the Olympics because it was ruled that jumping off his prosthesis gives him an advantage over non-amputees. His current world record stands at 8.72m – the ninth longest jump of all time. His 2024 best is 8.44m – a distance which would have won Olympic silver in Paris and gold at the previous four Games. As well as standard racing bikes with modifications where required and tandems, the Para-cycling road programme also features handcycling and trike races. A handcycle has three wheels and riders use the strength of their upper limbs to operate the chainset. It is used by cyclists with spinal cord injuries or with one or both lower limbs amputated. Tricycles are used by riders with locomotor dysfunction and balance issues such as cerebral palsy or hemiplegia.

Team-mate Harrison Walsh will also be challenging for a medal. And in the pool, 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith, the youngest member of the GB team, has a strong chance of a medal in the SB7 100m breaststroke (16:30) at her first Games. It could be a good day for the GB throwers. Along with Greaves and Walsh, Dan Pembroke defends his F13 javelin title (19:45) having won two world titles since his gold in Tokyo in 2021 while Funmi Oduwaiye will hope to challenge in the F64 women’s shot put (10:43). A throw around her season’s best of 11.82m could put the former basketball player in the medal mix and Anna Nicholson will be hoping for a first major medal in the F35 shot put (09:00), having smashed her PB earlier this summer. Also in the field, Olivia Breen in the T38 long jump (09:04) and Sammi Kinghorn in the T53 400m (18:25) on the track will be aiming to add to their Paralympic medals.

Sprinter Timothee Adolphe is one of the big home hopes for success at the Stade de France and he will be aiming to shine in the T11 100m final (18:08) for athletes with little or no vision. As well as his athletics career, Adolphe is also a talented hip hop artist and was signed up by fashion house Louis Vuitton for a Games advertising campaign where he joined Olympic swimming star Leon Marchand. In the pool, Germany’s Elena Semechin and American Ali Truwit will both be hoping to claim medals after challenging times. Semechin won gold at Tokyo 2020 under her maiden name of Krawzow but months later was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Now back to full fitness, she goes in the SB12 100m breaststroke (18:29). Truwit could be a big challenger in the 400m S10 freestyle final (16:50) just over a year after losing her leg below the knee in a shark attack in the Caribbean. Boccia is one of two Paralympic sports – along with goalball – which does not have an Olympic counterpart. Similar to petanque, it is played by athletes in wheelchairs who have an impairment that affects their motor function.

Jeanette Chippington, the oldest member of the ParalympicsGB team in Paris aged 54, is among the GB Para-canoeists getting their campaigns under way – she goes in the heats of the VL2 (09:20) before the preliminaries of the KL1 (10:25). GB will hope to continue their dominance in the Para-equestrian team test (from 08:30) having won every gold since it was introduced into the Games in 1996. It could also be a big day in the wheelchair fencing at the Grand Palais with Piers Gilliver aiming to retain his epee A crown (19:50) and both Dimitri Coutya in the epee B (18:40) and Gemma Collis in the women’s epee A (20:25) also in good form.

Dutch wheelchair tennis star Diede de Groot will be favourite to retain her women’s singles title at Roland Garros (from 12:30) after a 2024 which has already yielded Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles. And in the pool, Italy’s Simone Barlaam will be hoping for another successful night in the S9 100m butterfly (17:34) with Ireland’s Barry McClements bidding to figure. Para-equestrian teams are made up three athletes, at least one of which must be a Grade I, II or III and no more than two athletes within a team may be the same grade. Each combination rides the set test for their grade, which is scored as per the individual test – no scores are carried over from the previous test. The scores of all three team members are combined to produce a team total, and the nation with the highest total takes gold. In Grade I to III, athletes ride in smaller dressage arenas compared with Grade IV to V, and the difficulty of tests increases with the grade. Grade I athletes perform tests at a walk, while Grades II and III can walk and trot. In Grades IV and V, they perform tests at a walk, trot, cantor and do lateral work. Medal events: 75 Para-athletics (men’s T13 long jump, F34 shot put, T34 800m, T35 200m, T37 200m, T36 100m, F41 javelin, F33 shot put, T20 long jump, T38 1500m, T64 200m, F63 shot put, T47 400m; women’s F54 javelin, T13 400m, F40 shot put, T11 200m, T12 200m, T47 200m, T34 800m, T38 400m, T63 100m); Para-cycling road (women’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; men’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; mixed H1-5 team relay); Para-canoe (men’s KL1, KL2, KL3; women’s VL2, VL3); Para-equestrian (Grade I freestyle test, Grade II freestyle test, Grade III freestyle test, Grade IV freestyle test, Grade V freestyle test); Para-judo (men’s -90kg J1, -90kg J2, +90kg J1, +90kg J2, women’s +70kg J1, +70kg J2); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 73kg, up to 79kg; men’s up to 88kg, up to 97kg); Wheelchair tennis (men’s singles); Para-swimming (men’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S12 100m butterfly, S3 200m freestyle; women’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S11 100m freestyle, SM5 200m IM; mixed 34 point 4x100m freestyle relay); Para-table tennis (men’s MS4 singles, MS8 singles, MS9 singles; women’s WS4 singles, WS6 singles, WS8 singles, WS9 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s epee team, men’s epee team); Wheelchair basketball (men’s final), Blind football (final), Sitting volleyball (women’s final) The final day of the track athletics programme should see two of Britain’s most successful and high-profile athletes in action. Hannah Cockroft goes in as favourite for the T34 800m (19:20) – an event where she is two-time defending champion and unbeaten in the event at major championships since 2014. Shot putter Aled Sion Davies took bronze in the event at London 2012 but is unbeaten ever since and goes into the F63 final (19:25) as number one in the world while Zak Skinner will hope to make up for fourth in Tokyo with a medal in the T13 long jump (09:00). Tokyo gold medal-winning canoeist Emma Wiggs will be hoping to retain her VL2 title (10:52) while Charlotte Henshaw, who also won gold in Tokyo, and winter Paralympian Hope Gordon could be fighting it out in the VL3 event (11:36) – a new addition to the programme in Paris. Hannah Cockroft holds the world record in the T34 800m Britain’s three judoka will all be in action – Tokyo gold medallist Chris Skelley in the +90kg J2 division (final 17:13) after Dan Powell and Evan Molloy bid for glory in the -90kg J1 (14:32) and 90kg J2 (16:09) divisions. Ben Watson and Fin Graham could fight it out again in the men’s C1-3 road race (from 08:30) after winning gold and silver in Tokyo while Daphne Schrager and Fran Brown go in the women’s race. The Para-equestrian events conclude with the freestyle events (from 08:30) involving the top eight combinations in each grade from the individual tests earlier in the programme. The final night of the swimming could see butterfly success for both Alice Tai in the women’s S8 100m event (17:07) and for Stephen Clegg in the men’s S12 100m (18:23) – the latter was edged out for gold in Tokyo by 0.06 seconds. Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid will be hoping to figure in the men’s singles medal matches in the wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros (from 12:30) while at the Bercy Arena, the men’s wheelchair basketball programme comes to a climax (20:30). American Ellie Marks was due to compete at the 2014 Invictus Games in London but instead a respiratory infection left her in a coma in Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. She recovered and after winning four golds at the Invictus Games in 2016 presented one of the gold medals to the hospital staff who saved her life. She made her Paralympic debut in Rio, winning breaststroke gold and in Tokyo claimed S6 backstroke gold and will aim to defend her title (16:53). Italy will hope for another Para-athletics clean sweep in the T63 100m (20:22) where Ambra Sabatini, Martina Caironi and Monica Contrafatto finished in the medal positions in Tokyo and again at the 2023 and 2024 Worlds. And at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, Brazil will be hoping to continue their dominance in the blind football tournament in the gold-medal match (19:00). Blind football teams are made up of four outfield players and one goalkeeper, who is sighted. Matches are divided into two 20-minute halves and played on a pitch measuring 40 metres x 20 metres with boards running down both sidelines to keep the ball, which has rattles built in so players can locate it, within the field of play. In attack, the footballers are aided by a guide who stands behind the opposition goal. Spectators are asked to stay silent during play and when players move towards an opponent, go in for a tackle or are searching for the ball, they say ""voy"" or a similar word. Medal events: 14 Para-athletics (men’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon; women’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon); Para-canoe (women’s KL1, KL2, KL3; men’s VL2, VL3); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 86kg, over 86kg; men’s up to 107kg, over 107kg); Wheelchair basketball (women’s final) On the final day, action returns to the streets of the French capital with the marathons (from 07:00) which will include a 185-metre climb and link Seine-Saint-Denis, the area at the heart of the Games, and central Paris. As the race nears its end, the competitors will pass through Place de la Concorde, which hosted the opening ceremony, before heading up the Champs-Elysees and its cobbles to the Arc de Triomphe and the finish line at the Esplanade des Invalides, which was also the Olympic marathon finish. Eden Rainbow-Cooper made a major breakthrough when she won the Boston Marathon in April and will hope to shine on the Paris streets along with David Weir who famously won in London but was fifth in Tokyo after failing to finish in Rio. GB will be hoping for canoe success with defending KL2 champion Charlotte Henshaw and KL3 champion Laura Sugar both hoping to be on top of the podium again (10:41 and 11:07) and could model and Mr England winner Jack Eyers land a medal in the VL3 final (11:33)? Eyers chose to have his right leg amputated aged 16 and was the first amputee to be crowned Mr England The final day of powerlifting sees the heavyweights take to the stage – the women’s up to 86kg (09:35) and over 86kg divisions (13:00) and the men’s up to 107kg (08:00) and over 107kg (14:35) - the final gold medal before the closing ceremony. In the over 107kg division in Tokyo, Jordan’s Jamil Elshebli and Mansour Pourmirzaei of Iran both lifted 241kg – almost 38 stone in old money - with Elshebli winning gold on countback. China’s Deng Xuemei lifted 153kg to take the women’s over 86kg and you can expect plenty of big lifts again this time around. The women’s wheelchair basketball also takes centre stage with the Netherlands aiming to retain the title they won for the first time in Tokyo (final 12:45).",2024-08-28 23:11:25,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg4y131ge2ko,Elizabeth Hudson,2024-08-28 23:11:25,,True
1805,"Fury, hope and changing gear with a sword - Ukraine's Paris preparations","Fury, hope and changing gear with a sword - Ukraine's Paris preparations “I was ready to die. The probability of dying was so high that you had to come to terms with it.” In 2022, Danylo Chufarov’s home city of Mariupol was under siege. For three weeks, as the shells rained down around him, he survived on little food, no electricity and rain water.  His home was destroyed, along with most of his possessions. He didn’t train for six months. But, in 2023, he became a triple world champion - the best results of his long swimming career.  He was nominated for the prestigious Laureus Awards, posing for photos on the red carpet with tennis star Novak Djokovic and Real Madrid and England midfielder Jude Bellingham.  Now the swimmer, who is visually impaired, is hoping to become a Paralympic champion. “We can show we are ready to fight,” he smiles. “My country shall fight on the battlefield - and we shall fight in sport. That’s our mission.” Chufarov poses with 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in April Ukraine’s Paralympic success is one of sport’s more startling anomalies.  As a general rule, the Paralympic medal table broadly mirrors that of the Olympics. At the last summer Paralympics in Tokyo, China, Great Britain, the USA, Russia (competing as the Russian Paralympic Committee) and the Netherlands were the best performing nations. A month before, they had all finished in the top seven in the Olympic medal table. But next on the Paralympic list was Ukraine.  They won 98 Paralympic medals in Tokyo, putting them sixth.  And yet at the Olympics just a few weeks earlier, they had finished 44th. This was far from a one-off. In fact, Ukraine can claim to be the most consistently successful Paralympic nation in the world. At the last 10 Paralympic Games – summer and winter – since 2004, Ukraine have finished in the top six in every single medal table.  No other country in the world has done that. They competed at the 2022 Winter Games despite their country being invaded just a few days earlier.  After a four-day journey to Beijing, images of their athletes chanting “peace for Ukraine” resonated around the world, external.  Somehow, they went on to finish second in the medal table, ahead of traditional winter sport powerhouses such as France, Canada and the United States. The 2022 Winter Paralympics began a little over a week after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the country's Paralympic Committee, was part of Ukraine's protests at the Games The challenges that Ukraine’s athletes have faced since 2022 are all too stark.  Chufarov says the effects of his experiences in Mariupol will never leave him. “I lost a few kilos but that doesn’t reflect my mental state when I left the city. I believe that this trauma will stay with me forever,” he says. He now trains in a swimming pool near Dnipro. It is one of the few facilities near him that have not been destroyed or occupied by the Russian army. However, it is less than 100 miles from the front line.  “There are air-raid alarms all the time,"" he says. ""We have to escape to the bomb shelters – and there are electricity shortages too. These are the conditions we have to train in.” Chufarov's flat in an apartment block in Mariupol was destroyed by Russian shelling The man behind Ukraine’s extraordinary success is the president of their Paralympic Committee, Valeriy Sushkevych.  He developed a programme called Invasport, which created specialist facilities for disability sport in every region of the country. However, that infrastructure, like much else in Ukraine, has been badly damaged. Sushkevych says 500 of Ukraine's disabled sports facilities have been destroyed. He describes preparations for the Paris Paralympics as “terrible”, with athletes sleep-deprived from air-raid sirens sounding through the night. “There’s physical danger from bombs and rockets every day – every hour sometimes,"" he says. “What kind of preparation can we talk about when people training outdoors see rockets flying – and know these rockets are flying to kill people and kill their relatives?” He says repeating Ukraine’s success in recent Games will be difficult.  “Victory often depends on the emotion of the athlete. Say, for example, an athlete about to start their competition finds out that 10 minutes earlier, there was an air attack in Ukraine near their family.  ""Our athletes will need to be strong like our soldiers.” A lot of athletes have been forced abroad, with all the inevitable personal stress and disruption to training, especially as their coaches often can't go with them. Twenty-year old swimmer Anna Hontar now lives in Finland after escaping from the occupied city of Kherson.  Trapped inside her house for a month, her father made her an improvised gym. “He put rubber over some rails on the wall and I could imitate freestyle, butterfly and backstroke,"" she says.  ""It was too dangerous to go outside. There was fighting on the streets.” Hontar won 50m freestyle S6 bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics and has taken gold in the event at the two subsequent World Championships in Madeira and Manchester Arriving in Finland, her biggest shock was the quantity of snow – “In Ukraine, we get just a little bit, but it was so high” – but her swimming doesn’t seem to have suffered. Like Chufarov, she also won gold at the World Championships in Manchester last year. Those championships didn’t feature any Russian swimmers, who were banned from competing. At the Paralympics in Paris, that’s set to change. The International Paralympic Committee say it is expecting 90 Russian athletes to compete as neutrals. At the Olympics earlier in the summer, only 15 Russian athletes took part. Competing against Russian rivals will not be easy.  “They killed our children, people out on the streets and in the houses where they lived,"" says Hontar. “Swimming is not political – but maybe their parents, their uncles or their fathers have gone in to our country. It is so difficult.” I ask her whether this gives her an extra motivation to win at the Paralympics. “Yes” she replies instantly, her eyes suddenly flashing with determination. “I want to fight for Ukraine, for my family and for our Paralympic team. I want to fight.” Hontar has relocated to Finland from Kherson. The city was captured in the early days of the war as Russian forces swept west from occupied Crimea. It was liberated by Ukraine eight months later but is still under attack Other athletes have found their own ways to contribute to the war effort. Wheelchair fencer Andrii Demchuk crossed the border to Poland with his wife and two children after the invasion. After settling his family in Warsaw, he began helping other Ukrainian refugees. He ferried them from the border to the Polish capital, before returning with tents, sleeping bags and equipment for the Ukrainian army. He also delivered jeeps to the border – albeit in unconventional style. As a leg amputee, Demchuk normally drives an automatic. The jeeps were manual. “It was a bit of a problem because I don’t have a leg to push the clutch,” he says.  So – ingeniously - he used his fencing sword instead. “A broken rapier can push the clutch perfectly,” he explains, demonstrating his technique with an imaginary sword. “I delivered seven jeeps this way.” Together with two Polish fencing friends, Grzegorz Pluta and Stefan Makowski, he also began visiting local schools.  “We realised we needed to bring Polish and Ukrainian children together,"" Demchuk says. ""The Ukrainian kids were traumatised – and there were some differences.” They visited around 40 schools – and talked to about 10,000 children.  “We wanted to show the kids how sport can take your mind off your problems and that people who are disabled don’t give up and can still break barriers.” At this point, Demchuk realised that if he didn’t return to training, he wouldn’t qualify for the Paralympics, so Pluta and Makowski invited him to train at their club in Warsaw. Most of Ukraine's Para-fencers are in similar circumstances, having had to leave their homeland. Demchuk trained one of his team-mates - Nadiia Doloh - after her coach was unable to follow her to Poland. Despite the disruption, Ukraine’s Para-fencing team finished top of the medal table at this year’s European Championships. Demchuk gives an exhibition on Para-fencing at a school in Poland Demchuk has since returned to his home city of Lviv, where he’s taken on another role at the military hospital. He speaks to injured servicemen about adapting to life with a prosthetic. “I tell them that life goes on – and you don’t need to be worried,"" he says.  ""Don’t get depressed, don’t take to alcohol or other substances - just be active from the start. I won them over because I’m a sportsman and an amputee, so they trusted me.” And while his thoughts are now focused on Paris, they’re also focused on his countrymen. After he won a gold medal at the Rio Paralympics in 2016, he dedicated his triumph to two friends who had been been killed during Russia's earlier incursions into the Donbas region. Demchuk says he has lost many more friends during the current conflict. Will he be thinking of them when he competes in Paris? “The problem is, if I think about my friends – and about the war – I won’t win because of the emotions…. ” he says, his voice briefly faltering.  “In fencing, if you have this emotion, it’s not good. You’ll lose the fight before you even start.” But if you were to win a medal? He clasps his hands together, smiles and looks to the skies.  “I hope,” he says.

1801,Spectacular opening ceremony ignites Paris Paralympics,"The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games opening ceremony concluded with a dazzling firework display A spectacular opening ceremony marked the start of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games as athletes paraded along the iconic Champs-Elysees to Place de la Concorde in glorious conditions. As with the Olympic Games, the Paralympics opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in the French capital. The main ceremony was staged at Place de la Concorde, on a perfect summer evening in the heart of the city, following a parade along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees from the iconic Arc de Triomphe. Organisers estimated 65,000 people would be present, with spectators able to watch the parade for free before the ticketed open-air event. The first of 11 days of sporting action takes place on Thursday as France hosts a summer Paralympic Games for the first time. About 4,400 athletes from a record 168 delegations are set to take part in the 22 Paralympic sports, competing for a total of 549 gold medals in Paris. Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, said the opening ceremony represented the start of ""the Paralympic revolution"" led by the athletes. ""What makes you revolutionaries is that, when they told you 'no', you continued,"" Estanguet said. ""Tonight, you are inviting us to change our perspectives, change our attitudes, change our society to finally give every person their full place. ""Every emotion that you make us feel will carry a message that will never be forgotten: You have no limits, so let us stop imposing limits on you."" France's delegation arrived at the Place de la Concorde to a huge ovation Artistic director Thomas Jolly had promised the opening ceremony would be ""a spectacle that will showcase the Paralympic athletes and the values that they embody"". The staging of the event at the Place de la Concorde - the largest square in Paris - was designed as a symbol of the city putting the issue of inclusion for people with disabilities at the heart of society. While the Olympic Games had athletes travelling on boats down the River Seine in torrential rain, the opening ceremony for the Paralympic Games saw a parade take place on the route along the Champs-Elysees under golden skies. The delegations made their way along the Champs-Elysees to Place de la Concorde French former Paralympic swimmer Theo Curin was the star of the opening segment, transporting athletes in a taxi decorated by Phryges - the Paris 2024 mascot adapted for the Paralympics with a running blade. A series of artistic displays featuring performers with disabilities and impairments highlighted societal issues around inclusivity, the paradox of a world claiming to be inclusive but which remains full of prejudice a central theme. Blue, white and red smoke of the Tricolore was released by the Patrouille de France aerial display before the athletes made their entrance, while French singer Christine and the Queens also took to the main stage at the Place de la Concorde. A series of artistic performances marked the start of the opening ceremony British prime minister Keir Starmer was in attendance to welcome the ParalympicsGB delegation in to a party atmosphere, where the athletes arrived against the backdrop of a setting sun behind the Arc de Triomphe. Wheelchair tennis athlete Lucy Shuker and wheelchair basketball player Terry Bywater, contesting their fifth and seventh Games respectively, carried the British flag for ParalympicsGB after being voted as flagbearers by their team-mates. Sprinter Nantenin Keita and Para-triathlete Alexis Hanquinquant were on flag duties for host nation France, the final delegation to enter the Place de la Concorde, soaking up huge applause amid a rendition of Les Champs-Elysees. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Great Britain's paralympians arrive at the opening ceremony Following speeches by Estanguet and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons, French president Emmanuel Macron declared the Games officially open. Parsons said: ""The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games will show persons with disabilities what they can achieve at the highest level. ""The fact that these opportunities largely exist only in sport in the year 2024 is shocking. It is proof that we can and must do more to advance disability. ""That is why 225 years on from when Place de la Concorde was central to the French Revolution, I hope that Paris 2024 starts a Paralympic revolution - the inclusion revolution."" Twelve Paralympic champions formed part of the Paralympic flame parade, as it was transported to the Jardin des Tuileries. There the cauldron was lit by flagbearers Keita and Hanquinquant, Charles Antoine Kouakou, Fabien Lamirault and Elodie Lorandi, before being raised into the sky as the ceremony concluded with an eye-catching firework display. IPC president Parsons said in the lead-up to the Games that he believes Paris will deliver ""the most spectacular Paralympic Games ever"". Two million tickets have been sold, with about 500,000 still available. Many venues used during the Olympic Games are again in use for the Paralympics, with the athletics taking place at Stade de France, swimming at La Defense Arena, wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros and Para-equestrian at Chateau de Versailles. The Para-triathlon will take place in the centre of Paris, with the swim leg set to be held in the River Seine after the men's Olympic triathlon was delayed by a day and training sessions were cancelled because of poor water quality. As in the Olympics, Russia and ally Belarus are banned amid the ongoing war in Ukraine but some athletes from those nations are allowed to participate as part of a Neutral Paralympic Athletes (NPA) delegation. Eritrea, Kiribati and Kosovo will be represented in the Paralympics for the first time, while eight athletes will compete for the Paralympic Refugee Team. A team of 215 athletes will represent ParalympicsGB, with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport. Channel 4 will show the Games in the UK while BBC Radio 5 Live will have commentary, updates and dedicated programmes, and the BBC Sport website will have daily live text commentary. There are 22 gold medals to be won on the opening day - and no shortage of opportunities for ParalympicsGB to earn medals on day one. Find full details of the schedule in our day-by-day guide.

1814,Harris defends policy shifts in high-stakes first interview,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris defended how her policy positions have shifted since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee in her first interview since taking on the party mantle. ""I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,"" she said. In an early clip of the interview - which was pre-recorded in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday - CNN's Dana Bash had asked why Ms Harris's positions from her earlier political career had moderated on issues like immigration and fracking. The full interview of Ms Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz,  will air on CNN at 21:00 ET on Thursday (02:00 BST Friday). In the first preview clip, Ms Harris pushed back against the assertion that her policy positions had undergone ""changes"", and - in a second clip - she reaffirmed her belief that she would be a president ""for all Americans"". Her opponent, Donald Trump, has dismissed Ms Harris's interview because it was pre-taped and included Mr Walz. Ms Harris referred to her effort to address climate change and support of the Green New Deal, a Democratic proposal to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, as something that remains a steadfast value. ""I have always believed, and I've worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter,"" she said.  The vice-president pointed to the Biden administration's work on the Inflation Reduction Act, which funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programs. ""We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."" But, in the clips released so far, Ms Harris did not explain her reversal on banning fracking - a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock used by an industry that is particularly strong in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.  Ms Harris had said that ""there is no question I'm in favour of banning fracking"" during a CNN town hall in 2019. But she has backpedaled on that view since becoming vice-president - even casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate on new fracking leases.  Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesperson, said on social media that the Biden administration's ""clean energy investments have proven the ability to make progress on climate without those past stances"". On the subject of ""securing our border"" Ms Harris again said ""my values have not changed"" and referenced her time ""prosecuting transnational, criminal organisations"" as California attorney general. But Ms Harris once held more progressive immigration views as a senator and in her campaign for president in 2020. She had previously advocated for the closure of immigration detention centres and the decriminalisation of illegal crossings. Earlier this year, however, she supported a hardline bipartisan border security deal that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction. Trump pressured Republicans in Congress to kill the deal, but Ms Harris has promised to ""sign it into law"" if elected. To explain her moderated immigration view, the Democratic nominee told CNN that her travels across the country as vice-president had made her ""believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems"". Along those lines, Ms Harris committed in a separate clip to include someone ""who was a Republican"" in her presidential cabinet. She said it would fulfill her promise to be a president “for all Americans”. ""I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views."" Ms Harris has faced criticism from Republicans and some pundits for refusing to hold a press conference or an on-the-record, in-depth interview until now. Her critics argued that she was avoiding having her record challenged.  Her appearance on CNN marks her first substantive interview since President Joe Biden exited the presidential race on 21 July. Ms Harris had promised nearly three weeks ago to schedule an interview before the end of August. Former President Trump dismissed the CNN interview in a conversation with the Daily Mail on Thursday. ""Why isn't it live?"" he said. ""It's not a live interview. It's an interview that's going to be taped and then edited and then put out. So that's not even an interview. Then she's doing it with her vice president (nominee) sitting there."" Ms Bash, the CNN journalist who conducted the interview of Ms Harris and Mr Walz, moderated a Republican primary debate between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis in January. She was also one of the moderators of the 27 June debate between Mr Biden and Trump. Mr Biden's performance in that debate was widely seen as what sparked the effort for the president to withdraw from the race. Ms Harris's last sit-down TV interview was with CNN’s Anderson Cooper shortly after the June debate. The Harris-Walz campaign is following the interview with a bus tour of Georgia, a key southern state where Mr Biden narrowly edged out Trump in 2020 - the first time a Democrat won the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. Polling suggests that the presidential race is tightening again in Georgia - a state that Democrats thought had slipped away during Mr Biden's reelection campaign. On Thursday, Ms Harris is visiting the city of Savannah where she is holding a campaign rally at the state's oldest historically black college. The event coincides with a major outreach effort that is targeting young voters. The campaign plans to hold events at university campuses in major battleground states such as Georgia to encourage young Americans to cast their ballots in November. Trump and Ms Harris are scheduled to face off in a debate aired on ABC News on 10 September, though the presidential candidates are still working to resolve a dispute over whether microphones will be unmuted throughout.",2024-08-29 23:11:03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ejw1kd7ndo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1810,Arlington Cemetery worker 'pushed aside' by Trump aides - Army,"An Arlington National Cemetery employee was ""abruptly pushed aside"" by a member of President Donald Trump's campaign staff while trying to warn them about filming at the burial site for military members, the US Army said. The official was attempting to ensure Trump and campaign staff participating in a wreath-laying ceremony were adhering to rules, ""which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds"". ""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" a US Army spokesman said in a statement on Thursday.  The Trump campaign denied the allegations and said it received permission from families of fallen service members to film. Federal law prevents use of the cemetery for political campaigning and the US Army said participants were warned of the rules in advance. Though the incident was reported to the police, the employee decided not to pursue charges, according to the statement. The Army said it considered the matter closed.  Trump was at the memorial to honour the 13 US military service members who were killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago Monday.  The event took place in what’s known as Section 60 where troops killed fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried NPR earlier reported that two members of Mr Trump’s campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the worker aside when she tried to prevent filming or photographing. Defence officials told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that some Trump campaign staff were unprofessional and both verbally and physically aggressive towards the cemetery official.  Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, disputed that there was a physical altercation and said the campaign was prepared to release video to confirm its account. The campaign did share some footage of the visit on social media on Tuesday, but the alleged altercation was not included.  In his statement, Mr Cheung said: ""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony."" The tone of that statement, and further attacks by Mr Trump’s running mate JD Vance criticising coverage of the episode, have added further fuel to the row. Some veterans’ groups have accused Mr Trump of using the graves of fallen soldiers as a campaign stunt at America’s most hallowed ground to its war dead.  While the families of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan accompanied Mr Trump at the ceremony and said they approved of the photos, the rules do not allow families to give permission for filming in the cemetery. Mr Trump has repeatedly campaigned on his claim that the Biden-Harris administration lost control in Afghanistan, blaming them for the deaths of troops. In a post on Truth Social, Trump shared a statement from family members of the fallen soldiers honoured at the event, expressing their approval. “We had given our approval for President Trump’s official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured and so we can cherish these memories forever,” the families said in Trump's post.  But that goes against federal policy, an Arlington National Cemetery spokesperson told the BBC.  US law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities on the grounds of military cemeteries, including photographers, content creators or anyone directly supporting a partisan political candidate's campaign, the cemetery spokesperson said.  Utah Governor Spencer Cox, who is running for re-election, also attended the ceremony and posted a photo on X of himself with Trump and the family of Staff Sgt Darin Hoover, of Utah, who was killed during the withdrawal.  But he later came under fire for using the photo in a campaign email, forcing an apology post via X on Wednesday that acknowledged it should not have been sent: ""This was not a campaign event and was never intended to be used by the campaign."" Sgt Hoover's grave is next to that of Master Sgt Andrew Marckesano, who died by suicide after six tours in Afghanistan in 2020.    Sgt Marckesano's sister said that despite her family's support for the Hoover family, Trump campaign staff ""did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit"".  She urged visitors to remember that those buried there were ""real people"" who should be ""honoured and respected"".",2024-08-29 23:11:03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgwnn11x18o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1824,"Paralysed by an ex-boyfriend, Otto rises as Paralympian","Paralysed by an ex-boyfriend, Otto rises as Paralympian This article contains descriptions and details of domestic violence. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised, BBC Action Line can provide contacts to find help.   Tracy Otto was just tucking into her lunch when she was surprised by the news that she is going to the Paralympics. ""They gave Ricky [Riessle], my boyfriend, this box with a hat in it, saying 'you're qualified',"" the 28-year-old tells BBC Sport. ""When he presented it to me I was eating, I had food in my mouth. So I was eating and crying, and there were cameras everywhere."" Otto had been selected for the United States archery team, external at Paris 2024, where she will shoot in both the mixed teams with partner Jason Tabansky and in qualification for the W1 open individuals competition. ""It's so cool,"" Otto says from her Tampa home with a gigantic grin on her face.  ""From being on my deathbed to the Paralympics is just a crazy journey. I am in awe of myself and my team."" Otto is not exaggerating when she talks about being on her deathbed. In October 2019, Otto was attacked at her home by her ex-boyfriend. She was left paralysed from the chest down with limited use of her arms and hands, and lost her left eye. She can also no longer sweat or regulate her body temperature properly. Otto is willing to talk about the night which changed her life in remarkably honest detail in order, in her own words, to ""be a light, a beacon of hope in this world"".  She wants to let other women who have suffered violence at the hands of a partner or an ex know they are not alone. Otto had to learn how to swallow, eat and sit up again after being attacked in her own home In September 2019, Otto broke up with a boyfriend. A month previously, he had been arrested for attacking her at their home in Riverview, Florida.  Otto was ready to move on with her life, and had met someone new. “I had just started talking to Ricky,"" she told the BBC World Service's Sportshour programme. ""We met on 26 September 2019, and we went on a couple of dates.  ""I had broken up with my ex, kicked him out, told him to leave, he gathered all of his things, he was gone and I had changed all of the locks on my house. Everything was done. ""That night it was 24 October 2019, we had another little date, and we go off to bed. I remember rolling over and getting comfortable in bed and drifting off to sleep. ""And then all of a sudden, I hear this loud noise and I see a flashlight in my face and I was so confused.  ""And then I heard his voice, and I realised it was my ex. ""He had parked his car at the front of my house, went around the back of the house and looked through my bedroom window. We were sleeping, and he had decided to go to purchase a high-powered pellet gun.  ""He did the best that he could to get as close to a real gun as possible. And a knife and a set of handcuffs. ""And he comes back to my house, breaks in and wakes us up, screaming at us to get out of bed. ""He tells us that he's going to kill us and that if he didn't kill himself, he was going to call the police.  ""So, he outright told us what he was going to do. This is where everything gets kind of blurry because it happened so quickly. I can tell you what I know happened, I just don't have it first-hand because my brain just kind of blocked everything out."" The attacker punched Otto multiple times before shooting Riessle twice in the face and stabbing him in the back, causing his lung to collapse. He then shot Otto through the left eye, before stabbing her in the back of the neck, leaving her paralysed. He then sexually assaulted her. ""And he ends up calling the police on himself and tells them that 'this is my name, this is where I'm at'. He calls me his girlfriend, but then later admits to the police that we had broken up,"" Otto says. ""And he was like ''I just killed my girlfriend and her new boyfriend'. They show up, he's sitting in the driveway, and he gets taken away."" In January 2023, the ex-boyfriend pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary with assault, two counts of attempted murder in the first degree, one count of sexual battery and two counts of aggravated bodily harm. He was sentenced to 40 years in jail. Otto's boyfriend Ricky Riessle supported her through her lengthy stay in hospital The attack changed Otto's life forever. Nearly five years on, she is still re-learning how her body works. ""It's more than just the paralysis and the wheelchair that you see on the outside, there's a lot going on the inside that doesn't function any more,"" she says. ""So, for example, my diaphragm is paralysed as well, my body doesn't also regulate its temperature any more. I can't thermally regulate, and that means I can't sweat any more. ""So, if I sit out in the sun, like I do for archery, my body and my internal temperature gets incredibly high, so we have to do everything that we can to make sure I don't overheat and have a heatstroke. ""And there's also bowel and bladder issues where that doesn't function any more, so I have to find alternate ways of relieving myself. ""Because my brain can't communicate with the rest of my body, if something is wrong below my level of injury, I can't feel it. And it can be literally anything. ""I could have to go to the bathroom, I could have a scratch, my clothes may be too tight, I could have an ingrown toenail, anything.  ""If something happens below my level of injury that's an unwanted stimuli, my body  immediately goes into fight-or-flight mode and escalates my blood pressure. ""That's my body’s way of saying 'hey, something is wrong' but it gets dangerously high, and I can have a seizure, heart attack, stroke and ultimately die within minutes. And it can happen at any time."" Otto had ambitions to be a fitness model before she was attacked and paralysed For most people, just attempting to return to everyday life after something so traumatic would be enough. But Otto, formerly an aspiring fitness model, wanted to get back to being active. So, in March 2021, she picked up a sport she had never tried before on a whim.  ""I was in the car with Ricky, thinking about how I had lots of time on my hands - I can't work traditional jobs any more,"" she says. ""And I just thought 'why not try archery?' Ricky was like 'your hands don't work', but I just thought we'd figure it out. I did some research and found we have an adaptive archery course in our area. A week later I was shooting for the first time."" Because of her disabilities, Otto has to shoot with a specially designed harness. She used to release arrows from her right shoulder, but now uses her mouth. ""I have an adaptive release that is on my wrist - it has a cable that goes up in through my hat and has a closed pin-type apparatus that I bite down on when I’m ready to release the arrow,” she says. ""And then I have a hat and glove that allows me to be able to hold the bow so I don't drop it when I release the arrow."" Otto says she hit the target with the first arrow she ever shot, and was hooked. Otto uses a custom system involving her biting down on a small metal clip to release her arrows Soon, she had major ambitions. ""I wanted to go for Paralympics right away. In my second week of practice I was asking 'what does competing look like?'"" she says. Otto was soon touring the country, taking part in qualifying tournaments. As the only female American archer in her Paralympic category, she had to meet a minimum score - shooting 72 arrows, she needed 520 points from 720. She hit that mark last summer, and confirmed her passage to Paris in a three-stage series earlier this year, culminating on home turf in Florida, and that surprise celebration over lunch. Otto is very frank about what happened to her, and the struggles she faces in everyday life. But the Floridian is a vibrant and unabashed character who refuses to be cowed by the man who tried to take everything from her. ""I've had this feeling that there is a bigger picture about this situation,"" she says.  ""I have always wanted to leave an impact on this world, and be a light. There is so much darkness and hate, I can't justify not talking about and being an example for people hurt like me.  ""I can't just lie down and take it, lie down and die. ""Honestly it's exhausting. I'm very lucky that I have Ricky to help me, to make sure I am OK. But it is really hard, even picking something up, it reminds me of what happened to me. Your body does not work any more in the way it should. ""But there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and that is that I worked through it and have learned so much about it along the way.  ""My life is so much better now, much more colourful and full of love and laughter than it was before.""

1827,Why is Harris bringing Walz to her first major interview?,"Three weeks ago, just days after being formally chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was pressed on her plans for a sit-down interview. “I’ve talked to my team,” she told reporters on the airport tarmac in Detroit. “I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” On Thursday night, Ms Harris will - just barely - make good on that promise, sitting down with CNN’s Dana Bash for her first major interview. But Ms Harris will not be there by herself. The vice-president will be joined by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, for the prime-time appearance, airing  at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST). Ms Harris may have answered the question of when she would conduct an in-depth, substantive discussion of her candidacy and agenda - standard procedure for all major party presidential candidates. But with Mr Walz in tow, the decision to make this a joint appearance may also fuel growing criticism that after escaping the rigours of a months-long presidential primary, she is now dodging the scrutiny that comes with a solo interview. “I think it’s incredibly weak, weak sauce, to show up with your running mate,” said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W Bush, on CNN, adding that Harris had a “troubling lack of confidence"" in her own political ability. Still, supporters of Ms Harris insist that given the unprecedented nature of her candidacy following President Joe Biden's sudden departure from the race, she is taking things at a smart pace. “I think the cadence has been right,” said Peter Giangreco, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. “Win the nomination, pick your nominee, lay out your economic plan, do your convention and now do some sit-downs and amplify that.” Joint interviews featuring both members of a presidential ticket are not unusual.  Barack Obama and Joe Biden sat for an interview with 60 minutes after Mr Biden was selected as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008. Eight years later, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine did the same. For Ms Harris and Mr Biden in 2020, they picked ABC’s 20/20. And less than a week after Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate, the pair were jointly interviewed on Fox. But since Mr Biden passed the torch to her late last month, Ms Harris has limited most of her engagement with the press to scripted and highly-controlled environments. Her last formal sit-down interview was on 24 June, more than two months and a political lifetime ago. Her occasional interactions with reporters - brief answers to shouted questions on her way to and from campaign events - have done little to quell Republican claims that she is shirking any opportunity to have her record and agenda put under the microscope. The harshest criticism comes from her Republican opponents, who have both given several interviews in the past month. “She’s not smart enough to do a news conference,” Mr Trump told media earlier in August. “She won’t do interviews with friendly people because she can’t do better than Biden.”  The Democratic nominee has enjoyed a surge in momentum since entering the race. Now, after her whirlwind introduction to American voters, she needs to ""reinforce"" that energy, said Republican strategist and Trump critic Chip Felkel.  “She’s gotta get out there,” he said. “She’s got to show that she can think under pressure, because that’s part of what the president has to do.” Since she campaigned in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, Ms Harris has  switched her stance on several key policy positions, backing off some of her more liberal promises.  She has abandoned pledges to support Medicare for all (giving all Americans access to government-funded healthcare) and to ban fracking. And the vice-president now supports a bipartisan border bill that includes hundreds of millions of dollars on a border wall, something Ms Harris once called ""un-American"". These apparent changes could open her up to questions about being a policy flip-flopper - an unwelcome label for a candidate still trying to define herself.   But by doing a joint interview, the Harris campaign may have calculated that the pressure - and the difficult questions - will at least be shared between the two of them. And it ensures both are in lockstep when it comes to explaining policy. Mr Giangreco, the Democratic strategist, predicted Ms Harris and Mr Walz will try to turn the focus onto their economic plan, an agenda to lower the cost of living and provide economic security that she first announced at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, two weeks ago. Mr Giangreco also pointed to another potential benefit of a joint interview: drawing a contrast between Mr Walz and his Republican counterpart JD Vance who he has labelled as ""weird"". Still, the real impact of Ms Harris and Mr Walz’s sit-down won’t be known until it is done. Ms Harris’s record with high-pressure interviews is mixed. A 2021 conversation with NBC’s Lester Holt, in which she fumbled through questions about her role in the administration’s border policy, was widely regarded as a failure. But in a more recent appearance, a one-on-one with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, in which she defended Mr Biden’s calamitous debate performance, Ms Harris looked calm and confident amid a political firestorm. If this high-stakes CNN joint interview falls into the latter category, then the Harris campaign will hope much of the criticism will fall away, said Mr Felkel, the Republican strategist. “They just need to be able to say ‘See, we told you,’” he said. “And then keep moving.”",2024-08-29 23:11:04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3d72dxe5zo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

1818,All you need to know about the Paralympics,"The medals for the Paralympics feature braille on one side We've put together a guide with everything you need to know about this summer's Paralympics. Paris will stage the summer Games for the first time in 2024. It is the second time France will have hosted a Paralympics after the 1992 Winter Games in Tignes and Albertville.  About 4,400 athletes from around the world will take part in 22 sports, cheered on by crowds again after the rescheduled Tokyo Games in 2021 were held behind closed doors. The Paralympics will begin with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, 28 August. A total of 22 gold medals will be decided on the opening day of competition on Thursday, 29 August. The final day on Sunday, 8 September will feature medal events in wheelchair basketball, Para-powerlifting, Para-canoe and wheelchair marathons as well as the closing ceremony, which will take place at the Stade de France. Like the Olympic opening ceremony, the Paralympic ceremony will be held outside a stadium for the first time. But it will not feature boats floating down the River Seine. Instead, athletes will take part in what is being described as a ‘people’s parade’ travelling past some of Paris' most iconic landmarks, located along the route between the Champs-Elysees and the Place de la Concorde. Spectators can watch for free along the route before the official parade and before formalities take place in front of ticket-holders at the Place de la Concorde. Organisers estimate that around 50,000 people will watch the ceremony. The ceremony will feature the usual mix of music and movement and performers with disabilities will play an integral role in the show. Many of the venues being used at the Olympics will also stage Paralympic events. The Stade de France will host the athletics, the La Defense Arena the swimming, wheelchair tennis will be at Roland Garros, and the picturesque Chateau de Versailles gardens will be the venue for the Para-equestrian events. The Grand Palais, normally a venue for art and sport events, will host wheelchair fencing and Para-taekwondo, while the blind football competition will be in a specially built stadium at the foot of the iconic Eiffel Tower. Para-triathletes will compete in the centre of Paris, with the swim leg due to take place in the River Seine. Channel 4 will show the Games in the UK with more than 1,300 hours of live sport airing across Channel 4, More4, Channel 4 Streaming and Channel 4 Sport’s YouTube. BBC Radio 5 Live will have commentary and updates from key events in Paris, starting with 5 Live Drive from 16:00 BST.  There will also be programmes dedicated to the Paralympics on most evenings, usually between 19:00 and 21:00. The BBC Sport website will have live text commentary and reports on each day of the Games.  There are 22 sports in the Paralympic programme: Blind football Boccia Goalball Para-archery Para-athletics Para-badminton Para-canoe Para-cycling Para-equestrian  Para-judo Para-powerlifting Para-rowing Para-swimming Para-table tennis Para-taekwondo Para-triathlon Shooting Para-sport Sitting volleyball Wheelchair basketball Wheelchair fencing Wheelchair rugby Wheelchair tennis Unlike the past two editions of the Games, where Para-triathlon and Para-canoe (Rio) and Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton (Tokyo) made their debuts, no new sports are included in the Paris programme. However, the badminton and taekwondo programmes have been expanded and there are a record number of medal events for women. A total of 549 gold medals will be up for grabs. No – Team GB is a term used for the British Olympic team only. The organisation responsible for the Paralympic movement in the UK is the British Paralympic Association and the correct name for the Paralympic team who will be representing Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Paris is ParalympicsGB. ParalympicsGB will compete in 19 sports in Paris, having failed to qualify in blind football, goalball and sitting volleyball. The GB team will feature 215 athletes and you can find the confirmed names of who will be competing here. Among the stars in action will be Britain’s most successful Paralympian, Sarah Storey, who is competing at a ninth Games – a British record - and will be hoping to add to her 17 gold medals. Wheelchair tennis player Alfie Hewett will be aiming to win a first gold medal having completed a career Grand Slam by winning the Wimbledon singles title in July. Wheelchair racers Hannah Cockroft and Sammi Kinghorn, Para-cyclist Jody Cundy, table tennis player Will Bayley and swimmer Alice Tai will also be among those in action. In Tokyo, Britain finished second in the medal table behind China with 124 medals, including 41 golds. UK Sport has set a medal range of between 100 and 140 medals for the GB team. The increase in the profile of Para-sport has meant a gradual rise in the number of nations participating in a Paralympic Games. The Paris Games will feature around 4,400 athletes from a record 168 delegations – still short of the 207 delegations who competed at the Olympics. The total includes 167 National Paralympic Committees (NPC), an eight-strong Refugee Paralympic Team (RPT) and a Neutral Paralympic Athletes (NPA) delegation from Russia and Belarus. The previous record was 164 delegations at London 2012 while the previous highest number of athletes at a Paralympic Games was 4,393 at Tokyo 2020. Three NPCs – Eritrea, Kiribati and Kosovo – will make their Paralympic debut in the French capital. Athletes from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to compete at the Games as neutrals and the Neutral Paralympic Athletes delegation will feature up to 90 competitors from Russia and eight from Belarus. They will wear neutral uniforms that must not feature any national colours, flag, country name or national emblem, symbol or designation. They will compete under an NPA flag, and will not feature on the medals table or march in the opening or closing ceremonies. Should a neutral athlete win a gold medal, the Paralympic anthem will be played. All NPA were independently vetted to ensure they have not supported the Ukraine war and are not contracted to the military.  Although what became known as the first Paralympics took place in Rome in 1960, the seeds of the Games were sown more than a decade earlier in Britain. Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist who was working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programmes of his patients. In 1948, he set up a competition with other hospitals to coincide with the London Olympics and over the next decade his sporting idea was adopted by other spinal injury units in Britain. In 1960, 400 wheelchair athletes from 23 countries came to the Italian capital to compete in 57 medal events across eight sports at the ninth Annual International Stoke Mandeville Games, now regarded as the Rome 1960 Paralympic Games.",2024-08-29 23:11:04,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cer3wvlzpx1o,Unknown,2024-08-29 23:11:04,,True
1815,The athletes from around the world to follow,"Simone Barlaam will lead the Italian Para-swimming charge in Paris Paris will welcome about 4,500 athletes to the city to compete in the first summer Paralympics to be hosted by France. Competitors will take part in 22 sports across the 11 days of competition with 549 gold medals up for grabs. The Games will feature the usual mix of experienced international stars hoping to enhance their reputations and newcomers aiming to make their mark. BBC Sport looks at some of the global athletes who are aiming to shine on the biggest stage when action starts on Thursday, 29 August. Barlaam has been a key figure in Italy's emergence as a Paralympic powerhouse in the pool. The 24-year-old from Milan, who was born with one leg shorter than the other because of a hip issue, spent time in Paris as a child as he had a number of surgeries. After starting swimming competitively aged 14, he made his international debut at the 2017 World Championships in Mexico and has become a leading performer in the S9 category. Barlaam says he struggled at his first Paralympics in Tokyo, where he won gold, two silvers and a bronze, but comes to Paris after winning six golds in six races at last year's Worlds in Manchester and is a strong favourite to add to his tally. S9 400m freestyle: Thursday, 29 August; S9 50m freestyle Monday, 2 September; S9 100m backstroke: Tuesday, 3 September; S9 100m butterfly: Friday, 6 September; Mixed 4x100m freestyle 34 point relay: Saturday, 7 September Diede de Groot is world number one in both singles and doubles Dutch women have dominated wheelchair tennis for many years and De Groot is the latest star. The 27-year-old is world number one in both singles and doubles and won gold in both events in Tokyo, the latter with Aniek van Koot. Born with her right leg shorter than the other, she started playing wheelchair tennis aged seven and has dominated the sport since her breakthrough in 2017. She is the first player - wheelchair or non-disabled - to win three successive calendar Grand Slams and among her multiple titles are five French Open singles and six doubles titles at Roland Garros, where the Paralympic wheelchair tennis events will take place. Earlier this year, she was named the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability - following compatriot Esther Vergeer who won it in 2002 and 2008. Women's doubles final: Thursday, 5 September; Women's singles final: Friday, 6 September. Marcel Hug won four golds at the Tokyo Paralympics Hug's silver helmet has seen him dubbed the Silver Bullet but he is no stranger to gold and, as one of the stars of his sport, the 38-year-old will be hoping to add to his six Paralympic titles at the Stade de France. Hug was second best to Britain's David Weir at London 2012 but made his breakthrough four years later in Rio. The Swiss won his first gold in Rio in the T54 800m before adding another in the marathon. In Tokyo, he completed a clean sweep of wins in the 800m, 1500m, 5,000m and marathon before adding another three golds on the track in Paris at last year's Worlds. As well as the track, Hug also stars on the road and has multiple wins in the big city marathons of London, New York, Boston, Chicago and Berlin. T54 5,000m: Saturday, 31 August; T54 1500m: Tuesday, 3 September; T54 800m: Thursday, 5 September; T54 Marathon: Sunday, 8 September. Oksana Masters started out as a rower before switching to Para-cycling and cross-country skiing Masters has overcome much trauma to become a star of both summer and winter Paralympics. She was born in Ukraine in 1989 with multiple birth defects, three years after the Chernobyl disaster, and after being abandoned by her birth parents she grew up in an orphanage where she was regularly beaten and abused. Aged seven, she was adopted by American woman Gay Masters and eventually had both of her legs amputated above the knee and had surgery on her hands. After starting her sporting career as a rower and competing at London 2012, winning bronze, she switched to Para-cycling and cross-country skiing. She won two golds at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang before securing two golds on the road in Japan, then following up with three more golds at the 2022 Winters in Beijing in cross-country and biathlon. Last year, she released her autobiography, The Hard Parts, where she told her powerful story. H4-5 time trial: Wednesday, 4 September; H5 road race: Thursday, 5 September Markus Rehm's current long jump world record stands at 8.72m The man known as the Blade Jumper is an overwhelming favourite to win a fourth Paralympic long jump title in Paris. Rehm, who lost his right leg below the knee in a wakeboarding accident in 2003 and jumps using a bladed prosthesis, has been the star of Para-athletics since his international debut at the 2011 Worlds in New Zealand, constantly pushing the boundaries of his T64 event. His current world record stands at 8.72m - the ninth-longest jump of all time and his 2024 best is 8.44m - a distance which would have won Olympic silver in Paris and gold at the previous four Games. However, he is unable to compete at the Olympics because it was ruled that jumping off his prosthesis gives him an advantage over non-amputees. The Olympics' loss is the Paralympics' gain and Rehm in full flight is a sight to behold. T64 long jump: Wednesday, 4 September Sheetal Devi is the first and only female Para-archer to compete internationally without arms Aged only 17, Devi will be one of the youngest competitors both in archery and at the Games as a whole. The Indian was born with a condition called phocomelia and is missing her upper limbs. However, she shoots arrows using her feet and is the first and only female Para-archer to compete internationally without arms. She discovered archery three years ago and although coaches initially suggested that she use a prosthesis, she gained inspiration from American Matt Stutzman, the 2012 Paralympic silver medallist and 2022 world champion who was also born without arms. Her first major event was at the 2022 Asian Para Games where she won women's individual compound gold and mixed doubles gold. She also took silver in the women's doubles before claiming individual world silver last year and goes in as world number one. Women's individual compound: Saturday 31 August; Mixed team compound: Monday, 2 September All you need to know about the Paris Paralympics GB athletes to follow in Paris Paralympics Alexis Hanquinquant is unbeaten since winning gold at the Tokyo Games in 2021 The 38-year-old from Normandy is one of France's main hopes for gold at the Games. Hanquinquant is the defending Paralympic champion in the PTS4 category and has been the dominant figure in the division since his international debut in June 2016. He is unbeaten since his Tokyo win. A keen basketball player and combat sports practitioner, he had a work accident in 2010 and had his leg amputated below the knee three years later. He made his Para-sport breakthrough too late for Rio but by Tokyo he was a multiple world champion and secured gold by almost three minutes from his nearest rival. Along with Para-athlete Nantenin Keita, the father of two was voted by his team-mates to carry the French flag at the opening ceremony of the Paris Games. Men's PTS4 triathlon: Sunday, 1 September. Stickney's first sporting dream was to swim at the Olympics and she was ranked nationally in the top 20 aged 15 before she broke bones in her left foot - which was eventually amputated in May 2018 because of pain and complications. That was the start of her medical challenges, which led to her being diagnosed with a rare vascular condition which prevents sufficient blood supply from reaching her limbs. Stickney had a second below-the-knee amputation in 2019 and said then she would never swim again, but returned to the pool during the Covid pandemic and fell back in love with the sport. She went on to win two golds in Tokyo - her first international Para-swimming event. Since then, the condition has progressed and she has lost more of her legs and it is also affecting her whole body. In the build-up to the Games, Stickney, now 27, has had to spend 10 days or more in hospital in Boston every month for treatment but is fiercely determined to once again shine on the big stage.

1843,Harris unscathed after walking careful line in first interview,"Kamala Harris’s apparent reluctance to give an extended broadcast interview meant that her sit-down with CNN on Thursday night assumed an exaggerated significance. And placed her under greater scrutiny. It was not a strong start. Initially, Ms Harris struggled to lay out what she would do on day one of the job, talking in sweeping generalisations about creating an opportunity economy and trying to lower the cost of living. Ms Harris has been prone to giving complex, detailed and often confusing answers. Her opponents like to mock her “word salads”. This wasn’t a major issue in this interview, but she will need to craft a more concise explanation of how she intends to make life more affordable for ordinary, working Americans if she wants her message on the economy to land. Throughout the interview, which she did along with her vice-presidential pick Tim Walz, Ms Harris appeared calm and confident. And, crucially, didn’t score any own goals. Asked about her shifting positions on some key policies since she last ran for president in 2019, Ms Harris said her values had not changed  – before confirming that she no longer supports a ban on fracking for natural gas or decriminalising illegal immigration. And when addressing Republicans' claim that she is soft on border issues, she pointed to her previous experience as a prosecutor in California. It is experience that Ms Harris often leans on, including in her attacks on Donald Trump, whose criminal conviction she frequently points out. “I'm the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organisations who are trafficking guns, drugs and human beings,” she told CNN's Dana Bash. “I'm the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws.” Immigration and the southern border is potentially Ms Harris’s greatest liability in this election. It is an issue many voters care about passionately right across the country – and one on which the Biden administration has had little to boast about given the high numbers of undocumented immigrants at the US southern border. Joe Biden specifically tasked Ms Harris with addressing the “root causes” of Central American immigration. Republicans have used that brief to claim she was the “border tsar”, and therefore responsible for the record high rates of illegal border crossings in recent years. When pressed on the issue, Ms Harris told CNN on Thursday that she would resurrect a recent border security bill that was agreed in congress but scuppered by Trump, who told Republicans not to support it. The former president was worried it would damage him politically if the Biden administration was seen to be taking action on immigration. In reality, that move provided Democrats with a convenient talking point when challenged about why it has taken them so long to illegal border crossings. Ms Harris said she would push that legislation again and make sure it came to her desk so she could sign it. As she continues to campaign over the coming weeks before the election on 5 November, Ms Harris will have to walk a careful line. Does she talk up her role in the Biden administration? Or present herself as a candidate for change who represents the future not the past? On Thursday, she was scrupulously loyal to President Biden and did not try to distance herself from his policies. The problem is that if she wants to take credit for lowering the cost of prescription drugs for pensioners, for example, then she also risks taking the blame for high inflation. It is tricky territory. The Harris campaign often uses the phrase “we’re not going back”. And in this interview, while she was loyal to Mr Biden, she also repeatedly said it was time to “turn the page on the last decade”.  She then had to explain that she meant a decade of bitterness and division, not the last three and a half years of the Biden-Harris administration when she has been in power. It was a moment that deftly illustrated the challenge Ms Harris faces in presenting herself as a candidate of change. As Trump has struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms Harris, he has resorted to insults. He questioned her racial identity when he said at a recent event that “she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black”. Given a chance to respond directly to that on Thursday, Ms Harris shrugged it off. She said her opponent was using “the same old, tired playbook”. It is almost certainly a deliberate strategy not to engage with Trump’s personal attacks on the first female candidate of colour to be the presidential nominee for one of the major parties. Ms Harris does not talk about shattering the glass ceiling in the way Hillary Clinton did in 2016. And she says very little about the historic nature of a black woman running for president. She told CNN that she in the race because she believes she is the best person to do the job – regardless of race and gender Trump, meanwhile, posted his one-word verdict of the interview on his social media platform – ""BORING"". The Harris campaign will have taken that as high praise. After all, her most important job was to ensure she did not give Republicans any new ammunition to use against her.",2024-08-30 23:11:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlr46kepnjo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1844,Trump says he will vote against Florida abortion measure,"Donald Trump has said he will vote against a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would protect abortion rights.   It came one day after he appeared to hedge on the issue in an interview with NBC News, resulting in criticism from anti-abortion activists within his own party. On Friday, Trump told Fox News that he still thinks Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks is too strict. However he said would still vote ""no"" on a measure that would amend the state's constitution to protect abortion rights. ""So I think six weeks you need more time, then six weeks I’ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it I disagreed with it,"" Trump said.  ""At the same time the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month... So I’ll be voting no for that reason,"" he said. Abortion laws vary widely around the US, and abortions after 21 weeks pregnancy are rare - representing just 1% of all abortions and often related to medical concerns like foetal anomalies or threats to the life of the mother, according to the non-profit health organisation KFF. The Republican presidential nominee has come out against the Florida abortion measure just one day after he was asked by NBC News how he would vote.  “I think the six week is too short,” Trump said in the NBC News interview on Thursday. “It has to be more time. I told them that I want more weeks.” “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” he said when pressed. His Democratic opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris, quickly responded to Trump's announcement that he would support continuing Florida's abortion ban. “Donald Trump just made his position on abortion very clear: He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant,"" she said in a statement.   In 2022, the US Supreme Court struck down the right to abortion nationwide, leaving the decision to states. As a result, Florida banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. The proposed constitutional amendment does not specify a number of weeks, but would protect abortion access in the state until the point of foetal viability, which is about 23-25 weeks of pregnancy. As it stands, the state has a near-total ban on abortion, as many women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks. The proposed amendment states: “No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” Voters cannot choose a number of weeks into a pregnancy that abortion should be permitted. They can only choose “Yes” to support the amendment or “No” to reject it. Under state law, 60% of voters must vote ""Yes"" for the measure to pass. Trump has criticised Florida's six-week abortion ban before.  Last September he said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made a ""terrible mistake"" signing the ban into law. Mr DeSantis was challenging the former president in the Republican primary at the time. Thursday's comments - in which Trump appeared to be open to voting in favour of the constitutional amendment - were heavily criticised by leaders in the anti-abortion movement, which plays a critical role in shaping conservative politics in the US. “If Donald Trump loses, today is the day he lost,” conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “The committed pro-life community could turn a blind eye, in part, to national abortion issues. But for Trump to weigh in on Florida as he did will be a bridge too far for too many.” Albert Mohler Jr, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, wrote on X that Trump's comments on reproductive rights, including on the six-week ban, ""seem almost calculated to alienate prolife voters"". “Pro-life Christian voters are going to have to think clearly, honestly, and soberly about our challenge in this election - starting at the top of the ticket,"" he said. After the Thursday NBC interview, the Trump campaign and his running mate JD Vance made public statements emphasising that the former president had not yet made up his mind on the ballot initiative.  Mr Vance said the former president will ""make his own announcement on how he's going to vote"" on the Florida measure that will be based on ""his own judgement"". Opinion polling indicates that a majority of Americans support abortion access.  A July poll from the University of North Florida suggested that 69% of likely voters supported the Florida ballot measure, and 23% opposed it. The political backlash after the Supreme Court brought an end to Roe v Wade has presented Trump with a political conundrum he has yet to fully solve. Trump rose to power with the help of the religious right, which broadly supports restrictions on the procedure. In his first run for president, he pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn the constitutional right to abortion in the US.  He kept the promise by appointing three conservative jurists who ultimately voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Abortion has now become a central issue in the 2024 presidential campaign - one that Democrats have used to rally voters. His opponent, Vice-President Kamala Harris, has made reproductive rights central to her campaign. Trump has taken the position that abortion policy should be left to individual states. At the Republican National Convention in July, rank-and-file party members fell in line behind the former president, even though his position can seem at odds with their personal opposition to abortion. Some abortion opponents still seek to restrict the procedure nationwide or believe Trump is alienating their base. Further complicating Trump's standing is a new proposal to make the government or insurance companies pay for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).  Some anti-abortion and religious groups object to IVF due to its use of embryos.  In February, the Alabama state supreme court ruled that frozen embryos are legally considered children, throwing IVF treatments and fertility care in the state into chaos.  The Republican Party, and Trump, have sought to distance themselves from that ruling, and Alabama's Republican-controlled legislature later passed IVF protections. Responding to Trump's comments, the Harris campaign drew a sharp contrast with the Republican ticket on the issue of reproductive rights.  “We’re going to hold Donald Trump and JD Vance accountable for the devastating impacts of overturning Roe v Wade and their threats to access to IVF,” Harris spokesman Kevin Munoz told reporters on Friday. “Kamala Harris is going to fight for your rights. Donald Trump will take them away.”",2024-08-30 23:11:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy547v72nd4o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1853,GB's Maskill & Kearney claim gold in Paris,"This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Maskill wins GB's first medal of the Games with new world record Teenage swimmer Poppy Maskill created history with Britain's first gold of the Paris 2024 Paralympics. The 19-year-old from Cheshire, who is making her Games debut, set a new world record to win the women's S14 100m butterfly, describing it as 'unreal'. Later, team-mate Tully Kearney claimed victory in the S5 200m freestyle - a win she said was 'redemption' for silver in Tokyo. William Ellard also took silver in the S14 men's 100m butterfly as GB enjoyed a successful opening night in the pool. Maskill was fastest in Thursday morning's heats and again set the pace in the final, turning half a second clear and finishing strongly in one minute 3.00 seconds, 0.33 clear of the mark jointly held by her team-mate Olivia Newman-Baronius and Russian athlete Valeriia Shabalina, who is representing the Neutral Paralympic Athletic team in Paris.  Poppy Maskill made her GB debut in 2022 Hong Kong's Yui Lam Chan was second in 1:03.70 with Shabalina third (1:04.4) and Newman-Baronius out of the medals in fourth (1:04.59). ""It's unreal and it feels weird to be the team's first gold medallist,"" said Maskill, who was second to Chan at last year's World Championships in Manchester. ""I just wanted to swim my hardest and see what happens. I’ve worked hard in training and listened to what everyone tells me to do. ""It gives me more confidence for my other events."" Maskill is also a strong backstroke swimmer and will aim for gold in her 100m event on Friday, 6 September. Kearney is competing at her second Paralympics Kearney, who won 100m gold and 200m silver in Tokyo has had a torrid time since dealing with concussion, a change in racing category - a decision which was later overturned - and mental health issues. She qualified fastest and although Ukraine's Iryna Poida pushed her hard in the final, the 27-year-old from the West Midlands came through strongly to win in 2:46.50 ahead of Poida's 2:47.16. ""I really wanted redemption for Tokyo,"" said Kearney. ""I was never happy with that silver so to go and get gold is incredible and I am really happy with it. ""It has been really hard with the concussion and then over the last three or four months dealing with my mental health, so to get here means a lot to me.  ""Even a few weeks ago, we weren't sure if I was going to come out and compete and how many events I could do, so I am grateful to the team for all the support they have given me."" Maskill's success came moments after Ellard took silver in the men's race. The 18-year-old from Suffolk led at halfway with Alexander Hillhouse down in fourth, but the 20-year-old Dane came through in the second part of the race in a new Paralympic record of 54.61 seconds, with the Briton clocking 54.86. ""I didn't think I would be happy with silver but I am,"" said Ellard. ""It gives me more confidence for my 200m freestyle, which is my main event."" Ellard was being interviewed by the media as Maskill won her gold and he was thrilled to see his team-mate achieve glory. ""It's big for the team and a huge personal best for Poppy as well,"" he added. ""I know she wants to try to get the world record in the 100m backstroke later in the programme, but this is a big bonus for her.""  Earlier, the La Defense Arena reached fever pitch for the opening race of the night as Frenchman Ugo Didier overhauled Italian rival Simone Barlaam to win gold in the men’s S9 400m freestyle. Didier, 22, had finished second to Australian William Martin in Tokyo and has regularly gone up against Barlaam in their category, with the Italian usually getting the upper hand. It looked like a similar story again with Barlaam leading most of the race, but Didier made his way through gradually and seized the lead in the final 50m, cheered on loudly by his home crowd. ""It was unbelievable, the cheering for me helped me a lot,"" he said. ""I don't think I could have done it without the crowd. ""I am very happy for this medal but what it means to me is the emotions and to share with all my family and friends."" Paris 2024 Paralympics What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics?

1848,Georgia election workers ask court to seize Giuliani's assets,"Two US election workers who successfully sued Rudy Giuliani for over $140m (£106m) for defamation have asked a court to seize some of his assets.   Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss have filed a court order asking the former New York City mayor to relinquish multiple properties, dozens of luxury watches, a Mercedes-Benz and other personal items in the next seven days. Mr Giuliani falsely accused the pair of tampering with votes during the 2020 election. In July, a federal judge dismissed a bankruptcy case by Mr Giuliani, leaving Trump's former lawyer without protection from his creditors.  Ms Freeman and Ms Moss are now asking for Mr Giuliani's condo in New York, worth an estimated $6m, according to CNN, and his condo in Palm Beach, Florida, worth an estimated $3.5m. They are also seeking three of his New York Yankees World Series rings, one of which is valued at roughly $30,000. Lawyers for the two said if Mr Giuliani does not meet their requests in a timely manner, they will seek other remedies.  Their lawyers accused Mr Giuliani of a history of “evasion, obstruction, and outright disobedience"" and said ""that strategy reaches the end of the line here"". Mr Giuliani is currently appealing the defamation judgement.  ""The appeal of the objectively unreasonable $148 million verdict hasn't even been heard, yet opposing counsel continues to take steps designed to harass and intimidate the mayor,"" Mr Giuliani's spokesman Ted Goodman said in an email to Reuters. In December, a jury found Mr Giuliani liable for defamation for spreading lies about Ms Freeman and Ms Moss, two former election workers from Georgia, when he accused them of tampering with votes.  The judge ordered Mr Giuliani to pay millions in damages, including more than $16m each for emotional distress. The women said they had to endure threats and harassment after being targeted by Mr Giuliani. He filed for bankruptcy shortly after the decision.  Other legal troubles still await Mr Giuliani, once dubbed ""America's Mayor"".  In May, he pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges in what prosecutors say was a ""fake elector"" scheme to declare Trump the winner of the 2020 election in Arizona. Mr Giuliani was charged alongside 17 others for his alleged role in that scheme.",2024-08-30 23:11:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4xz7e59zvo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

Neil and pilot Matt Rotherham are world champions in the B 1,000m time trial (final 12:51) with team-mates James Ball and Steffan Lloyd likely to be a big danger. Lora and Corrine Hall will also face a tough challenge in the B 3,000m individual pursuit (qualifying 10:22, final 13:31) against world champions and team-mates Lizzi Jordan and Danni Khan and the 2023 world champions Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl.

The Fachies have been juggling cycling and parenthood since the birth of son Fraser It is an early start for the triathletes with all 11 medal events taking place (from 07:15). The races start in the River Seine, which was at the centre of controversy during the Olympics over its water quality with training cancelled and the men's race delayed by a day. Because of weather concerns, all races have all been moved to 1 September.  The rivalry between former swimming team-mates Lauren Steadman and Claire Cashmore will continue in the PTS5 event (11:35) – the British pair won gold and bronze in Tokyo with American Grace Norman, the Rio champion, finishing second.

Brock Whiston should be up against American legend Jessica Long in the SM8 200m medley final (17:07) while the mixed S14 4x100m freestyle team are well fancied to retain the title GB won in Tokyo (19:13), although this year’s team will be a brand new quartet. Wheelchair racer Hannah Cockroft goes for her fourth consecutive T34 100m title (19:33) with Kare Adenegan hoping to claim another medal, while world champion Sabrina Fortune goes into the F20 shot put (18:00) in good form having improved her own world record in July. Boccia player Claire Taggart will be aiming to win the first women’s BC2 Paralympic title (18:35) while the wheelchair rugby tournament reaches the semi-final stage (12:30 and 18:30) with defending champions GB hoping to figure. The home crowd will be cheering on French triathlete Alexis Hanquinquant as he hopes to continue his dominance in the PTS4 event (11:25). Hanquinquant, who had his leg amputated in 2013 after a work accident, was always a keen sportsman and made his Paralympic debut in Tokyo, finishing almost four minutes clear of his nearest rival, and is the man to beat in the division. American high jumper Roderick Townsend is the star of the T47 event and he goes for a third title in a row (18:28). After the retirement of 18:47) Ireland’s Jason Smyth, there will be a new champion in the T13 100m (with Tokyo runner-up Skander Djamil Athmani of Algeria and the T12 gold medallist Salum Ageze Kashafali of Norway bidding to lead the charge.

Dimitri Coutya and Piers Gilliver have been leading the GB wheelchair fencing challenge and they start their busy programmes with the sabre B (19:50) and sabre A (20:40) events while Gemma Collis will go in the women’s sabre A (21:05) And the men’s wheelchair basketball reaches the quarter-final stage (from 13:45) as the GB team bid to claim another medal. In athletics, expect plenty of interest around the women’s T12 400m final (11:10), which could feature Italian transgender sprinter Valentina Petrillo. Los Angeles teenager Ezra Frech will be aiming to win Paralympic gold aged 19 in the T63 men’s high jump (19:20) and he is also tipped to be one of the faces of the 2028 Games, while his 20-year-old team-mate Jaydin Blackwell is the favourite for the T38 400m (18:21). Swiss pair Catherine Debrunner and Manuela Schaer should be among the leading figures in the women’s T54 1500m (11:20) And Italian swimmers Carlotta Gilli and Stefano Raimondi will be key medal hopes for their nation in the women’s SM13 200m IM (18:59) and men’s S10 butterfly (19:28) respectively.

The 17-time gold medallist across swimming and cycling opted out of the track programme to concentrate on the road and she starts her campaign for gold number 18 in the C5 time trial (from 07:00) – an event where she has won gold at every Games since her cycling debut in 2008. The women’s B time trial could also be a good one for GB with Tokyo silver medallists Lora Fachie and Corrine Hall and the 2023 world silver medallists Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl aiming for gold. Ben Watson, Jaco van Gass and Fin Graham will be aiming for a clean sweep in the men’s C3 time trial while Archie Atkinson will be chasing hard in the C4 event. Storey is competing at her ninth Games - a British Paralympic record Scottish wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn will be hoping to become the first non-Chinese athlete to win the T53 100m title (19:36) since Tanni Grey-Thompson triumphed in Athens in 2004. Kinghorn won world gold in 2023 but China’s Fang Gao and Hongzhuan Zhou and Switzerland’s Catherine Debrunner will be big dangers.

Germany’s Markus Rehm – best known as the Blade Jumper – will start as strong favourite to win his fourth Paralympic long jump title in the T64 category (18:26). Rehm, who lost his right leg below the knee in a wakeboarding accident in 2003 and jumps using a bladed prosthesis, has been the star of Para-athletics, constantly pushing the boundaries of his event. However, he is unable to compete at the Olympics because it was ruled that jumping off his prosthesis gives him an advantage over non-amputees. His current world record stands at 8.72m – the ninth longest jump of all time. His 2024 best is 8.44m – a distance which would have won Olympic silver in Paris and gold at the previous four Games. As well as standard racing bikes with modifications where required and tandems, the Para-cycling road programme also features handcycling and trike races. A handcycle has three wheels and riders use the strength of their upper limbs to operate the chainset. It is used by cyclists with spinal cord injuries or with one or both lower limbs amputated.

Team-mate Harrison Walsh will also be challenging for a medal. And in the pool, 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith, the youngest member of the GB team, has a strong chance of a medal in the SB7 100m breaststroke (16:30) at her first Games. It could be a good day for the GB throwers. Along with Greaves and Walsh, Dan Pembroke defends his F13 javelin title (19:45) having won two world titles since his gold in Tokyo in 2021 while Funmi Oduwaiye will hope to challenge in the F64 women’s shot put (10:43). A throw around her season’s best of 11.82m could put the former basketball player in the medal mix and Anna Nicholson will be hoping for a first major medal in the F35 shot put (09:00), having smashed her PB earlier this summer. Also in the field, Olivia Breen in the T38 long jump (09:04) and Sammi Kinghorn in the T53 400m (18:25) on the track will be aiming to add to their Paralympic medals.

Sprinter Timothee Adolphe is one of the big home hopes for success at the Stade de France and he will be aiming to shine in the T11 100m final (18:08) for athletes with little or no vision. As well as his athletics career, Adolphe is also a talented hip hop artist and was signed up by fashion house Louis Vuitton for a Games advertising campaign where he joined Olympic swimming star Leon Marchand. In the pool, Germany’s Elena Semechin and American Ali Truwit will both be hoping to claim medals after challenging times. Semechin won gold at Tokyo 2020 under her maiden name of Krawzow but months later was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Now back to full fitness, she goes in the SB12 100m breaststroke (18:29). Truwit could be a big challenger in the 400m S10 freestyle final (16:50) just over a year after losing her leg below the knee in a shark attack in the Caribbean. Boccia is one of two Paralympic sports – along with goalball – which does not have an Olympic counterpart. Similar to petanque, it is played by athletes in wheelchairs who have an impairment that affects their motor function.

Para-equestrian teams are made up three athletes, at least one of which must be a Grade I, II or III and no more than two athletes within a team may be the same grade. Each combination rides the set test for their grade, which is scored as per the individual test – no scores are carried over from the previous test. The scores of all three team members are combined to produce a team total, and the nation with the highest total takes gold. In Grade I to III, athletes ride in smaller dressage arenas compared with Grade IV to V, and the difficulty of tests increases with the grade. Grade I athletes perform tests at a walk, while Grades II and III can walk and trot. In Grades IV and V, they perform tests at a walk, trot, cantor and do lateral work.

Hannah Cockroft goes in as favourite for the T34 800m (19:20) – an event where she is two-time defending champion and unbeaten in the event at major championships since 2014. Shot putter Aled Sion Davies took bronze in the event at London 2012 but is unbeaten ever since and goes into the F63 final (19:25) as number one in the world while Zak Skinner will hope to make up for fourth in Tokyo with a medal in the T13 long jump (09:00). Tokyo gold medal-winning canoeist Emma Wiggs will be hoping to retain her VL2 title (10:52) while Charlotte Henshaw, who also won gold in Tokyo, and winter Paralympian Hope Gordon could be fighting it out in the VL3 event (11:36) – a new addition to the programme in Paris. Hannah Cockroft holds the world record in the T34 800m Britain’s three judoka will all be in action – Tokyo gold medallist Chris Skelley in the +90kg J2 division (final 17:13) after Dan Powell and Evan Molloy bid for glory in the -90kg J1 (14:32) and 90kg J2 (16:09) divisions. Ben Watson and Fin Graham could fight it out again in the men’s C1-3 road race (from 08:30) after winning gold and silver in Tokyo while Daphne Schrager and Fran Brown go in the women’s race. The Para-equestrian events conclude with the freestyle events (from 08:30) involving the top eight combinations in each grade from the individual tests earlier in the programme. The final night of the swimming could see butterfly success for both Alice Tai in the women’s S8 100m event (17:07) and for Stephen Clegg in the men’s S12 100m (18:23) – the latter was edged out for gold in Tokyo by 0.06 seconds. Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid will be hoping to figure in the men’s singles medal matches in the wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros (from 12:30) while at the Bercy Arena, the men’s wheelchair basketball programme comes to a climax (20:30). American Ellie Marks was due to compete at the 2014 Invictus Games in London but instead a respiratory infection left her in a coma in Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. She recovered and after winning four golds at the Invictus Games in 2016 presented one of the gold medals to the hospital staff who saved her life. She made her Paralympic debut in Rio, winning breaststroke gold and in Tokyo claimed S6 backstroke gold and will aim to defend her title (16:53). Italy will hope for another Para-athletics clean sweep in the T63 100m (20:22) where Ambra Sabatini, Martina Caironi and Monica Contrafatto finished in the medal positions in Tokyo and again at the 2023 and 2024 Worlds. And at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, Brazil will be hoping to continue their dominance in the blind football tournament in the gold-medal match (19:00). Blind football teams are made up of four outfield players and one goalkeeper, who is sighted. Matches are divided into two 20-minute halves and played on a pitch measuring 40 metres x 20 metres with boards running down both sidelines to keep the ball, which has rattles built in so players can locate it, within the field of play. In attack, the footballers are aided by a guide who stands behind the opposition goal. Spectators are asked to stay silent during play and when players move towards an opponent, go in for a tackle or are searching for the ball, they say ""voy"" or a similar word. Medal events: 14 Para-athletics (men’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon; women’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon); Para-canoe (women’s KL1, KL2, KL3; men’s VL2, VL3); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 86kg, over 86kg; men’s up to 107kg, over 107kg); Wheelchair basketball (women’s final) On the final day, action returns to the streets of the French capital with the marathons (from 07:00) which will include a 185-metre climb and link Seine-Saint-Denis, the area at the heart of the Games, and central Paris. As the race nears its end, the competitors will pass through Place de la Concorde, which hosted the opening ceremony, before heading up the Champs-Elysees and its cobbles to the Arc de Triomphe and the finish line at the Esplanade des Invalides, which was also the Olympic marathon finish. Eden Rainbow-Cooper made a major breakthrough when she won the Boston Marathon in April and will hope to shine on the Paris streets along with David Weir who famously won in London but was fifth in Tokyo after failing to finish in Rio. GB will be hoping for canoe success with defending KL2 champion Charlotte Henshaw and KL3 champion Laura Sugar both hoping to be on top of the podium again (10:41 and 11:07) and could model and Mr England winner Jack Eyers land a medal in the VL3 final (11:33)? Eyers chose to have his right leg amputated aged 16 and was the first amputee to be crowned Mr England The final day of powerlifting sees the heavyweights take to the stage – the women’s up to 86kg (09:35) and over 86kg divisions (13:00) and the men’s up to 107kg (08:00) and over 107kg (14:35) - the final gold medal before the closing ceremony. In the over 107kg division in Tokyo, Jordan’s Jamil Elshebli and Mansour Pourmirzaei of Iran both lifted 241kg – almost 38 stone in old money - with Elshebli winning gold on countback. China’s Deng Xuemei lifted 153kg to take the women’s over 86kg and you can expect plenty of big lifts again this time around. The women’s wheelchair basketball also takes centre stage with the Netherlands aiming to retain the title they won for the first time in Tokyo (final 12:45).",2024-08-30 23:11:30,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg4y131ge2ko,Elizabeth Hudson,2024-08-30 23:11:30,,True
1854,Fact-checking Kamala Harris’s first campaign interview,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has given her first interview since entering the race - a joint conversation alongside running mate Tim Walz. BBC Verify has looked into claims she made in the CNN interview about fracking, the Biden administration’s record on child tax poverty and investment in clean-energy jobs. CLAIM: In Thursday’s interview, Ms Harris said she would not ban fracking and maintained that she has “not changed that position”. VERDICT: This needs context and could be misleading as Ms Harris has changed her public position on fracking. In 2019, she said she was “in favour of banning fracking.” The following year, in the 2020 vice presidential debate when she was on the Biden ticket, Ms Harris said “Joe Biden will not end fracking” and: “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.” During the CNN interview on Thursday she was pressed on her 2019 statement, and Ms Harris responded: “I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice-president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” In the debate, Ms Harris was referring to President Joe Biden’s policy plans. She did not state whether her own views at the time differed from this position. CLAIM: “When we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit, so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%.” VERDICT: This is somewhat of an exaggeration and needs context. Child poverty rates did fall, but not by “over 50%” and they rose again the year after, so the impact was only temporary. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is one measure of poverty in the US and it does show that the child poverty rate fell 46% between 2020 and 2021. However, after the Covid-era boost to child tax credit ended, the record low child poverty rate of 5.2% in 2021 rose to 12.4% the following year, according to 2022 Census Bureau data. Americans earning less than $200,000 annually (or $400,000 for joint claimants) can, under the current child tax credit scheme, get $2,000 per year for each of their children under the age of 17. This amount was increased by President Biden during the Covid pandemic up to a maximum of $3,600 but it reverted back to $2,000 at the end of 2021. Kamala Harris has said that as president she would restore the child tax credit enhancement and provide $6,000 per child to families for the first year of a baby’s life. CLAIM: “What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean-energy jobs.” VERDICT: It is true that a large number of clean energy jobs have been created under the Biden administration, but the exact number is uncertain. Kamala Harris is referring to the jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act - a law signed by Joe Biden in August 2022 that introduced major investments in clean energy and climate-related projects. The claim of “over 300,000 new clean-energy jobs” comes from a recent report by Climate Power, a climate communications organisation. It reported that since August 2022 companies have “announced and advanced 646 new clean energy projects totalling 334,565 new jobs”. However, not all of these new job roles have necessarily begun, and it is also hard to attribute the whole increase in climate-related employment to the Inflation Reduction Act at a time when clean energy is growing across the world. Other groups give different numbers. E2, an economics and environment group, estimates around 109,000 clean-energy jobs have been created or announced since the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the US Department of Energy, in 2023 clean-energy employment grew at a rate twice as large as the US economy overall and the rest of the energy sector.",2024-08-30 23:11:30,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy78g4vg3po,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1874,GB win four golds on day two of Paralympics,"This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: GB's Tully Kearney wins second swimming gold in Paris Tully Kearney claimed her second gold of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games while Jaco van Gass triumphed at the velodrome despite being hit by a car just days earlier, as Great Britain won four golds on an outstanding day two. Just 24 hours after Kearney won swimming gold in the S5 200m freestyle, the 27-year-old returned to the pool to successfully defend her 100m freestyle title. Paralympic and world champion Maisie Summers-Newton then retained her crown in the women’s SM6 200m individual medley at La Defense Arena. Van Gass won the first British cycling gold on the track with victory over team-mate Fin Graham in the men’s 3,000m individual pursuit final, before Lizzi Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan won women’s B 1,000m time trial gold - with Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl taking bronze. Blaine Hunt started Friday's medal rush with silver in the men’s C4-5 1,000m time trial, while Matthew Robertson won men's C2 3,000m individual pursuit bronze. Brock Whiston clinched GB's ninth medal of the day with silver on her Paralympic debut in the women's SB8 100m breaststroke. That took ParalympicsGB's total haul to 15 medals - including six golds - after two days, second only to China (25 medals, 12 golds) in the table. Kearney and Summers-Newton power to swimming golds Van Gass wins cycling gold days after car accident Swimmer Hext to miss Paris 2024 on medical advice After winning gold on Thursday evening, Kearney forged ahead of Ukrainian silver medallist Iryna Poida on the last length to clinch her second triumph, with Italy’s Monica Boggioni taking bronze. Summers-Newton then seized her moment in the spotlight, powering clear of the field to take gold as team-mate Grace Harvey placed fourth, while Bruce Dee finished in the same position in the men’s race. Whiston then completed another successful day in the pool for GB, the 27-year-old finishing second to 16-year-old Spaniard Anastasiya Dmytriv Dmytriv in her final. Twin sisters Scarlett and Eliza Humphrey finished seventh and eighth respectively in their first Paralympic final in the S11 400m. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Maisie Summers-Newton defends Para-swimming title Meanwhile, US Para-swimmer Christie Raleigh Crossley, who won silver in the women's S9 50m freestyle on Thursday evening, has claimed she is being targeted and bullied over her classification as a disabled athlete. The 37-year-old, who set a world record in the heats, said she received negative comments on social media before the final, ""including comments by a team member - a team-mate of mine"". She added: ""The fact it is a prominent team member of Team USA who has come after me the hardest, it's just absolutely disgusting."" The gold rush for GB started when Van Gass successfully defended the Paralympic title he won at his Games debut in Tokyo in the men’s 3,000m individual pursuit. The British Army veteran was the favourite going into the final having set a world record in the heats in 3:15.488 to finish ahead of team-mate Graham, who took silver in Tokyo. Van Gass, 38, quickly opened up a sizeable lead in the final and revealed afterwards his victory had come just a week after he was hit by a car on a training ride in Paris. ""I was heartbroken, I literally thought this could be my Paralympics done,"" Van Gass said. ""I took a day off to let my body settle, then I was back on the bike."" This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Jaco van Gass wins Britain's first cycling gold medal of the Games It was then Jordan’s turn to star, alongside pilot Khan, beating the time set by Australia’s Jessica Gallagher and pilot Caitlin Ward to take gold. Silver medallist Hunt, sporting a magnificent handlebar moustache on his Paralympic debut, was one of three Britons in the men’s C4-5 1,000m time trial alongside Jody Cundy, who finished fourth at his eighth Paralympics, and Archie Atkinson in fifth. Robertson claimed bronze after beating Japan’s Shota Kawamoto in the men’s C2 3,000m individual pursuit. ParalympicsGB legend David Weir ensured he will have the chance to win his 11th medal at the Games on Saturday after safely qualifying for the men's T54 5,000m final. There the 45-year-old, winner of six Paralympic titles, will come up against reigning champion Marcel Hug of Switzerland in an eagerly anticipated showdown. Weir broke the T54 5,000m British record in February, finishing within 0.2 seconds of Hug as the Swiss set a world record. ""I don't set goals for medals anymore because I tried that in Tokyo and it just put too much pressure on me. I will just do my best tomorrow and hopefully it will be a medal. If it isn't, I'll move on to the next race,"" Weir said. David Weir has not won a Paralympic medal since winning four golds at London 2012 The first evening session of Para-athletics at Stade de France also saw Brazil's Petrucio Ferreira, the fastest Paralympian in the world, complete a T47 100m treble. Ferreira, who smashed the world record in a time of 10.29 seconds in 2022, won a third consecutive Paralympic title after successes at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 in a time of 10.68secs. ""I'm happy, lightning has struck for the third time at the Paralympic Games and I'm coming home with another medal. It's an emotion that's hard to describe,"" said Ferreira, who lost his left arm below the elbow in an accident at the age of two. Earlier, British debutant Zac Shaw qualified for Saturday’s men's T12 100m final in a photo finish and will seek to upgrade his 2024 world bronze, while Eden Rainbow-Cooper qualified for the women's T54 5,000m final at her first Paralympics. ParalympicsGB history maker Rachel Choong, the first female to represent Great Britain in Para-badminton at a Paralympic Games, won her opening women's singles SH6 group match at La Chapelle Arena. Choong, 30, came back from a game down to beat Peru's Rubi Milagros Fernandez Vargas in a decider to put herself on course for a place in the quarter-finals. Elsewhere, British Para-rower Benjamin Pritchard, fifth in Tokyo, set a Paralympics Games best time in the PR1 men’s single sculls heats in 8:51.26 to reach the final. There was also a world best for Frankie Allen, Josh O’Brien, Giedre Rakauskaite, Ed Fuller and cox Erin Kennedy in the PR3 mixed coxed four, shaving more than three seconds off their own previous record. GB's wheelchair rugby team followed up victory over Australia with a narrow 55-53 win over Denmark in their preliminary-round Group B match , while Para-archer Phoebe Paterson Pine beat Ecuador’s Diana Gonzabay Guaman to progress. Zakia Khudadadi, from Afghanistan, became the first member of the Paralympic Refugee team to win a medal in Paris with bronze in the K44 -47kg Para-taekwondo category. The 25-year-old, one of eight members of the Paralympic Refugee Team, said she hopes her achievement ""sends a message for all the refugees in the world to follow hope, follow freedom and follow peace"". There are 49 gold medals to be won on Saturday and you can follow live text coverage of the action on the BBC Sport website and app from 12:30 BST.

1880,Kamala Harris criticises Trump over Arlington Cemetery dispute,"Vice President Kamala Harris is criticising former president Donald Trump over a recent controversy involving his campaign at Arlington National Cemetery, saying the military burial site is “not a place for politics”. Ms Harris took aim at Trump on Saturday in a post on social media, writing that he “disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt”. The US Army said a Trump staffer “abruptly pushed aside” a cemetery employee who was trying to warn his team about rules against filming in the cemetery. The Trump campaign has disputed the cemetery's version of events and said it received permission from the families of the fallen soldiers to film. The incident happened on Monday, when Trump was at an event honouring 13 US military service members who were killed during the country's withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago. Saturday’s post marks the first time Ms Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, has commented on the controversy. She wrote that she has visited Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia several times during her tenure as vice president, and she would never use the site for political gain. “If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,” Ms Harris said. “And it is my belief that someone who cannot meet this simple, sacred duty should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States of America.” At a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump hit back at those who had criticised him over the incident. He said he had been asked to pose for a photo at the site after the memorial by family members of the soldiers who had died. “I go there, they ask me to have a picture and they say I was campaigning,” Trump said. “The one thing I get plenty of is publicity. I don't need that. I don't need the publicity.” Trump's running mate JD Vance used the controversy to attack the Biden administration over its handling of the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying that Ms Harris ""can go to hell"".  ""Three years ago, 13 brave, innocent Americans died, and they died because Kamala Harris refused to do her job,"" Mr Vance said on Wednesday in response to questions from BBC's US partner, CBS News.  NPR reported earlier that two members of Trump’s campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the cemetery worker aside when she tried to intervene.  Federal law prevents use of the cemetery for political campaigning and the US Army said participants were warned of the rules in advance. A US Army spokesperson said on Thursday that “the incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked.” The Trump campaign has denied that a physical altercation took place at the cemetery, adding “we are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made”. House Democrats have since asked the US Army for a report into the incident, asking for a “full account” of what happened.",2024-08-31 23:09:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39k379grzlo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1892,Kamala Harris has thrived in debates - will her tactics work on Trump?,"During a pivotal debate in the 2020 US presidential election, one candidate seemed to dominate the stage. They interrupted their rivals at strategic moments, sometimes speaking over them. They directly confronted an opponent, Joe Biden, generating headlines for days and had critics questioning whether they had breached some sort of unspoken political decorum. That candidate, however, wasn’t Donald Trump. It was Kamala Harris. On 10 September, Ms Harris will once again take to the debate stage. But this time, having gone one step further than 2020 by becoming the Democratic candidate for president, she will face Trump in a showdown that poses the toughest challenge of her campaign so far. Debates have played a major role in Ms Harris’s political career, from her run for California attorney general to her ascent to the vice-presidency. In watching four of her key debates back, it is clear that Ms Harris knows when to seize the spotlight, but also when to stand by as a rival administers a self-inflicted blow. Ms Harris will be hoping to utilise these instincts against the notoriously combative Trump. Her campaign will also want to dispel longstanding concerns about her political messaging skills that began with her failed run for the White House in 2020, and were only heightened by her fumbling some interviews in recent years. There is no room for error given how these events are defined by viral clips, so it is just as important for the Harris campaign that she avoids stumbling as it is for her to land a highlight-reel blow. “She needs to hold her own,” said Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, an organisation that supports women of colour in politics. “And she needs to communicate on the debate stage what she’s fighting for."" In her earliest debate appearances, Ms Harris found success by letting her opponents dismantle themselves. In a 2010 debate for the position of California attorney general, moderators asked Ms Harris and her Republican opponent Steve Cooley about a controversial practice known as double-dipping, which allows a public official to draw from their government salary as well as a pension. “Do you plan to double-dip by taking both a pension and your salary as attorney general?” a moderator asked the candidates. “Yes, I do,” Mr Cooley replied. “I earned it.” For a while, Ms Harris said nothing as he defended his position. “Go for it, Steve,” she eventually retorted. “You earned it!” Ms Harris’s campaign swifty cut the moment into an advertisement they used to hammer Mr Cooley as out of touch. She won the election by a razor-thin margin. And during a 2016 debate for a California US Senate seat, Ms Harris’s opponent inexplicably punctuated her closing statement with a dab – a dance move that was popular at the time. Ms Harris, who looked taken aback, waited a few beats before quipping: “So, there’s a clear difference between the candidates in this race.” Voters again backed Ms Harris. Both examples demonstrate Ms Harris’s eye for opportunity on the debate stage, as well as a sense for knowing when it is best to step back. “I think she is someone who uses silence incredibly well,” said Maya Rupert, a Democratic strategist who worked on Julián Castro and Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaigns. As she entered the national stage, Ms Harris proved adept at claiming the floor for herself, even amid a crowded field. One of her tried-and-tested tactics involves openly declaring her intention to speak, compelling her opponents – and the audience – to listen. The 2020 vice-presidential debate is remembered primarily for one line she directed at Mike Pence as he began to interrupt: “Mr Vice-President, I’m speaking.” And just weeks ago - illustrating that the riposte was more than a one-off - Ms Harris used the same line on Gaza protesters who interrupted her rally in Detroit. “I’m speaking now,” she told them. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.” “She’s using something that a lot of black women have used effectively, which is to insist on their time, and to insist to be heard,” said Ms Allison. “She’s very effective in making sure that she is heard, and respected.” But perhaps her most memorable debate moment came in 2019, when Ms Harris, then a US senator, stopped all crosstalk during the Democratic primary debate in Miami to challenge Mr Biden over his past position on a policy known as bussing. She criticised Mr Biden for working with lawmakers who opposed the Civil Rights Era policy of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Ms Harris said. She paused for effect before telling Mr Biden: “And that little girl was me.” Nina Smith, who was the travelling press secretary for presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg at the time, said the moment made rival campaigns sit up and pay attention. “What it showed us as a team is if she sees an opening she’s going to go after it,” Ms Smith recalled to the BBC. “I think it made her a rather skilled debater in that regard. It’s definitely something we watched out for, any sort of unexpected punch that could come from Senator Harris at the time.” “It showed that prosecutorial ability… to really highlight weaknesses in her opponents,” she said. By the end of the debate, Ms Harris had spoken more than any other candidate except Mr Biden. Her campaign announced it raised $2 million in 24 hours after the debate. But despite the breakthrough moment and subsequent surge in the polls, Ms Harris later struggled to articulate her own position on bussing. It only served to underscore the concerns with her messaging and ability to articulate a consistent policy position. The episode was one of many messaging stumbles Ms Harris made that ultimately sank her first presidential bid. Her failure to articulate a consistent policy agenda was one of the most common reasons cited, and it is an issue she needs to clarify quickly at the debate when she will almost certainly be pressed on policy specifics. Republicans have circulated clips of Ms Harris’ public remarks for years to ridicule her speaking style and cast her as inept. She has used verbose phrases when speaking off the cuff, and while a few turns of phrase have been embraced by her supporters, opponents have often criticised her for a lack of clarity. In a recent CNN interview, her first since becoming the nominee, she gave an answer on climate change which illustrated the issue. “It is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time,” Ms Harris said. On a debate stage, however, speaking time is limited and clarity of message is crucial. The looming debate on ABC News will be her biggest chance yet to reset public opinion, and past debates show that Ms Harris often brings a sharp toolkit to these events and is able to land blows. But the pressure of those past debates will pale in comparison to the stakes when she comes face-to-face with Trump for the first time. Even for the most experienced politicians, Trump presents a formidable challenge, the strategists agreed. In a 2016 debate against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, he famously stalked her around the stage, drawing all attention to him even when it was her turn to answer. His first 2020 presidential debate against Mr Biden devolved into an unintelligible melee when Trump kept interrupting. At one point, Mr Biden grew so irritated he snapped: “Will you shut up, man?” “Donald Trump is a unique and special case in that you never really know what’s coming,” said Ms Smith, who has prepared Democratic candidates for debates. “During debate prep, I would not allow her to get comfortable, in order for her to develop some sort of instinct, or callousness, to anything that could come up.” Ms Harris, a former prosecutor, is skilled at back-and-forth exchanges on the debate stage. It is something she has also demonstrated during heated Senate hearings when she has grilled Trump officials and Supreme Court nominees. But the format of the upcoming ABC debate may limit her ability to flex her prosecutorial skills, as the microphones will reportedly be muted when it is the other person’s turn to speak. This likely means, based on the Biden-Trump debate in June which had the same rules, that she will be fielding tricky questions from moderators as opposed to clashing with Trump.  And when Ms Harris is on the end of prosecutorial questions, as opposed to giving them, she has floundered in the past, such as in a notorious 2021 interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt in which she struggled when pressed on the issue of illegal immigration. One pitfall that Ms Rupert could envision for the Harris camp is their candidate being drawn into a lengthy debate over facts with Trump. That could muddle the debate for voters, and leave viewers with an impression that he has dominated the conversation. She suggested a third tactic for Ms Harris to add to her arsenal – not to prosecute, or remain silent, but to ignore. “She has an important opportunity here to get her point across,” Ms Rupert said, “And not be overly burdened by what he is doing next to her.” North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

1891,‘I want to see her challenged’ - swing voters unconvinced by Harris interview,"Kamala Harris’s first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential candidate was an opportunity to introduce herself - and her campaign’s message - to Americans who say they do not yet know her or for what she stands. The vice-president defended her record in the White House and addressed questions about a series of policy shifts since she first ran for the top job in 2019 during the CNN interview on Thursday. Ms Harris and her running mate - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who joined her for the interview - have enjoyed a surge of enthusiasm from Democrats in recent weeks,  but the campaign knows they must win over undecided voters to win November’s election. Young men are a significant proportion of those persuadable voters, and a group that Republican Donald Trump has been aggressively targeting with a slew of recent media appearances on podcasts that boast audiences that are largely young and male. Given the battle for their vote, what did three of them make of Ms Harris’s first sit-down interview? ROHAN VIJAYAN, 29, Pennsylvania This software engineer backed Democrats in the last two elections but remains undecided in 2024. Harris can speak coherently, which I think is just an upgrade from the prior two candidates, both Trump and Biden. I think she's relatively eloquent in the way that she talks. But in terms of policy, this was the first time I think I’ve actually heard some elements of substantive policy from her.  The interview didn't do a whole lot to assuage my concerns - what she’d actually want to do and whether she'd be able to effectively implement it. You’ve been VP for a few years, why haven't you attempted these things before? The interview didn’t change my mind on how to vote. To be honest, I want to see her challenged in a press conference or obviously the debate that's coming up. I think I need to see her in that kind of a setting, without a teleprompter or rehearsed answers. I think the interview was a little too coddled. I want to see her put under some pressure. I don't think she's done too well in the past as the VP in those situations. Walz came across as very personable. I think he helps kind of instill a sense of this good old American, kind of down-to-earth feeling that I think was missing from her in particular. I do like his addition to the ticket. JEREMY PETERSEN, 26, Utah A teacher who voted for the Green Party in 2020, Jeremy felt Harris’s message lacked conviction. I feel they've been very vague. I understand why, to a degree, from their perspective that it's more ‘Let's make this about Donald Trump,’ rather than about policy. But that only gets you so far.  I was frustrated with her for saying the phrase ‘My values have not changed, but my policies have.’ If you were consistent on your values, if you want clean energy, then you would still be in favour of the ban on fracking. When they talked about the Israel and Gaza she said we're going to maintain the Biden administration policy. It's a policy that, at least to me, has failed both Jews and Palestinians. People on both sides seem to be no closer to a deal and people on both sides continue to suffer. So saying we're going to maintain a policy that has gotten nowhere in almost a year feels almost like she's rather just trying to not lose voters rather than say I'm going to work towards a solution. I didn’t hear enough to persuade me yet. Because it feels like, on one hand, she's saying, we'll be different to Biden, but on the other hand, it's also like it's just going to be the same with a new face. EDWARD GREENE, 22, New Hampshire A student who did not vote last time, he feels lost since his favourite candidate, Robert Kennedy Jr, endorsed Trump. I wasn't particularly impressed, to be honest. I don't think the interview revealed much. I also understand that’s sort of politics, and that's going to be true of any given campaign, that the more specific they get, the easier it is to campaign against them. I appreciated when Harris specifically was talking about her planned measures for economic reform and this opportunity economy she was talking about. But I don’t think it was particularly compelling or the questions were particularly challenging. I'm not sure if anything in it would convince me to vote for the Harris-Walz campaign. One of the big reasons people were excited for Harris taking over the ticket - after Biden was so bad in live, unscripted environments - was that she was young and she might infuse more energy into the Democratic campaign. But because of the lack of live interviews and answering questions so far I still have concerns about their competency.

1884,Afghan refugee says medal 'a woman's dream',"Zakia Khudadadi was the flagbearer for Afghanistan at the closing ceremony of the  Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 The first member of the Paralympic Refugee Team to win a medal says she hopes her achievement ""sends a message for all the refugees in the world to follow hope, follow freedom and follow peace"". Zakia Khudadadi, from Afghanistan, won bronze in the K44 -47kg Para-taekwondo category in Paris. The 25-year-old is based in the French capital and one of eight members of the Paralympic Refugee Team competing at the 2024 edition. She represented her country in Tokyo three years ago after being safely evacuated in the days prior to the Games when the Taliban swept into the Afghan capital, Kabul and seized power, as foreign forces hastily completed their withdrawal. The Taliban government has placed heavy restrictions on women's rights in Afghanistan. Protesters have told the BBC they were beaten, abused, jailed and even threatened with death by stoning.  ""Today, in my country, life is not easy for all the women and girls in Afghanistan because the Taliban is in Afghanistan,"" Khudadadi told the BBC World Service.  ""Everything is finished for all the women. Maybe for this medal all the women continue life and continue the fight with the Taliban. Maybe [one day] we are together with peace in my country."" Khudadadi, who won gold in her division at last year's European Championships, says living in France, and having access to professional facilities and support, has allowed her to fulfil her potential. ""In Afghanistan it was not very professional and there were many problems,"" she added. ""Here in France everything is perfect, especially my coach, who is the best coach in the world for me."" She says she will compete at the Los Angeles Paralympics in 2028 ""for a gold medal"", and also intends to try Para-athletics. For now, though, Khudadadi can enjoy the immense satisfaction of her history-making bronze medal and its wider significance.  ""I'm so happy and I'm so proud for this medal because after three years I have worked hard every morning, every afternoon,"" she said.

Hansi Flick's side are the only team to win all four matches at the start of the campaign and moved seven points ahead of champions Real Madrid.

Valladolid kept the Catalans at bay until stoppage time in the first half, when defender Jules Kounde secured a healthy lead after prodding home from a corner. Brazil's Raphinha scored two in eight minutes to secure the match ball before new signing Dani Olmo added a sixth with his second goal for the club.

1919,Trump signals backing for Florida marijuana legalisation,"Donald Trump has signalled that he will vote in favour of legalising marijuana for personal use in his home state of Florida, ahead of a ballot on the issue in November. The Republican presidential nominee wrote on his Truth Social platform that voters are highly likely to approve the measure ""whether people like it or not"" and therefore ""it should be done correctly"".  The former US president's stance puts him at odds with other senior Republican figures, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has argued that legalising recreational cannabis use would ""be bad for quality of life"". Medicinal marijuana was made legal in Florida in 2016. Cannabis for both personal and medical use is legal in 24 US states, according to the Pew Research Centre. A further 14 states have legalised medical marijuana. Trump said: ""Someone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other states. ""We do not need to ruin lives and waste taxpayer dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them.""  The proposal is one of a number of amendments Florida residents will vote on in November at the same time as the US chooses its new president. Trump is running against incumbent vice-president and Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris.  On legalising marijuana for personal use, Trump said that there would need to be rules in place to ""prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat-run cities"". Mr DeSantis has claimed that making cannabis legal for recreational use ""would turn Florida into San Francisco or Chicago"" - both cities in Democrat-run states.  Marijuana was legalised in Illinois 2020 and between January and July this year, cannabis sales reached more that $1bn (£760m), according to state government statistics.  In California, where personal use was legalised in 2016, marijuana sales reached $4.4bn last year. However, it is not clear how those figures compare to black market sales of cannabis which, according to some, still thrives. Legalised growers and sellers have to get permits and pay tax, which can prove costly and risk making their cannabis more expensive.    ""The black market is very pervasive and it is definitely larger than the legal market,"" Bill Jones, the head of enforcement for California's Department of Cannabis Control, told US broadcaster NPR earlier this year.  Trump has already caused some confusion about a different amendment that will be on Florida's ballot in November. On Friday he said he would vote against a measure in Florida that would protect abortion rights, after facing backlash from conservative supporters. Abortion is banned in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy - the amendment proposes expanding that to 24 weeks. Trump had initially signalled support for the proposal.  His campaign later claimed he had not said how he would vote in ballot, simply that he thought that the six week period was ""too short"". The following day, Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago estate is in Palm Beach, Florida, said he would be voting ""no"".

1914,Record-breaking super Sunday for GB at Paralympics,"Hannah Cockroft (right) won GB's first athletics gold in Paris Great Britain celebrated their most successful day at a Paralympic Games this century with 12 gold medals on a record-breaking super Sunday at Paris 2024. Hannah Cockroft won her fourth successive women's T34 100m title to clinch GB's first Para-athletics gold, ahead of team-mate Kare Adenegan, before Sabrina Fortune produced a world record to win the women's F20 shot put title at the Stade de France. Four golds were won in the pool, where Maisie Summers-Newton took the women's SB6 100m breaststroke title, Brock Whiston claimed women's SM8 200m individual medley gold as Alice Tai took bronze, Grace Harvey triumphed in the women's SB5 100m breaststroke, and Britain's quartet won mixed S14 4x100m relay gold. The final day of Para-track cycling action in the velodrome brought three GB golds, with James Ball and pilot Steffan Lloyd beating team-mates Neil Fachie and Matt Rotherham to the men's B 1,000m time trial title. Sophie Unwin and pilot Jenny Holl triumphed in the women's B 3,000m individual pursuit, with bronze going to Lora Fachie and Corrine Hall, while there was open C1-5 750m team sprint success for Jody Cundy, Jaco van Gass and Kadeena Cox. The day began with three rowing golds, won by Lauren Rowles and Gregg Stevenson in the mixed double sculls, Ben Pritchard in the men's single sculls and the mixed coxed four. Among GB's 18 medals, there was also silver for Sammi Kinghorn in the Para-athletics women's T53 800m, and rowers Annie Caddick and Sam Murray in the mixed PR3 double sculls silver. ParalympicsGB's previous record for gold medals won on a single day at a Games was nine - achieved at both Rio 2016 and Beijing 2008. The outstanding haul of 12 on day four took the team to 23 golds in Paris, with their overall medal total at 43 - second only to China (67 medals including 30 golds), who have topped the table at the past five Games. Four golds for GB's 'kings and queens in the pool' Cockroft and Fortune start GB gold rush in Paris GB clinch three golds in last day of track cycling GB claim three gold medals in Para-rowing Cockroft is now an eight-time Paralympic champion after storming to her fourth consecutive T34 100m title, ahead of team-mate Adenegan, in 16.80 seconds. The 32-year-old Cockroft, dominant in the event since her international debut in 2011, is three behind Tanni Grey-Thompson's record for most Para-athletics golds at the Games by a GB competitor. She can narrow that gap by retaining her T34 800m title on Saturday. ""The support was amazing. I can't wipe the smile from my face. For 12 years, that's what we've worked for. I knew Paris could do it, and I'm so glad they did,"" said Cockroft. ""I'm making my life well hard doing this. You know you're the one people are watching but that's what keeps you going, you don't want to let people down and I know I have more in me."" This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Hannah Cockroft wins fourth consecutive 100m gold Shot putter Fortune produced a world record 15.12m with her first attempt of the final to seal her maiden Games title in style, having won bronze in Rio but placed fifth in Tokyo three years ago. “I still can’t believe it, especially on the first throw. I just wanted to jump up and down and celebrate right then - and then I remembered I [still] had five more throws after that,"" Fortune said. After a two-day wait, Kinghorn earned GB's first athletics medal as the only athlete able to follow world record holder Catherine Debrunner's explosive start - the Swiss setting a Paralympic record in one minute 41.04 seconds. Two-time champion Jonny Peacock, a medallist at his three previous Games, qualified safely for Monday's T64 100m final (18:46 BST). It was yet another superb night in the pool for ParalympicsGB, who lead the Para-swimming medal table after four days of action with an unmatched 11 golds among their 16 medals. Summers-Newton led from start to finish to capture her second title in Paris in the SB6 100m breaststroke, before Whiston produced a stunning comeback to overturn a halfway deficit of more than 10 seconds to team-mate Tai in the SM8 200m individual medley and edge Viktoriia Ishchiulova in the closing stages. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Maisie Summers-Newton wins second gold of 2024 Games That success was a long time coming for Whiston, unable to compete at the Tokyo Games or the 2022 Commonwealth Games because of issues around eligibility and category. ""I knew I had something to prove to myself and I was out there to show myself what I can do. I was like, 'nothing's stopping me'. I was ready for it tonight,"" Whiston said. Harvey upgraded her silver from Tokyo 2020 in the SB5 100m breaststroke as GB's medal rush continued, with a fourth gold added by the S14 mixed 4x100m freestyle quartet of teenagers William Ellard, Rhys Darbey, Poppy Maskill and Olivia Newman-Baronius in the final event of the day. Darbey, 17, said: ""I’m looking forward to seeing what we can do in Los Angeles [in 2028]; everyone in this team is under 20. Hopefully that world record can be ours in LA."" Britain's Para-cyclists also shone on the closing day of track events at the velodrome, topping the final medal table after adding three golds, a silver and bronze on Sunday. Ball and pilot Lloyd beat team-mates Fachie and Rotherham to men's B 1,000m time trial gold to reverse the result of the Tokyo 2020 final, before Unwin and Holl judged their 3,000m effort perfectly to overhaul Ireland's Katie-George Dunlevy and Eve McCrystal. Cox, having suffered heartbreak when her bid for women's C4-5 5,000m gold was ended by an early fall on Thursday, then returned to the track to help GB to gold in the open C1-5 5,000m alongside Van Gass and nine-time gold medallist Cundy. This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Kadeena Cox, Jaco van Gass and Jody Cundy win team sprint gold Cox blasted out of the blocks to establish a lead for the team, who went on to beat Spain by 1.826 seconds.

Mentally I had to climb over a massive hurdle to be on the start line."" ParalympicsGB had a near-perfect morning with three golds and a silver from five Para-rowing races at the Vaires-sur-Marne stadium. Rowles, 26, claimed a historic win in the PR2 mixed double sculls with Stevenson, becoming the first British rower to win three Paralympic golds. It came in a thrilling final in which the British pair recovered from more than a boat length behind China's Liu Shuang and Jiang Jijian to take gold on the line. Lauren Rowles won her third rowing gold after successes at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 with former partner Laurence Whiteley After setting a Paralympic record in qualifying, Pritchard earned gold in the PR1 single sculls, and Great Britain's PR3 mixed coxed four of Frankie Allen, Giedre Rakauskaite, Josh O'Brien and Ed Fuller, coxed by Erin Kennedy, retained their Tokyo title. Kennedy, who received the all-clear from breast cancer last year, said: ""Today is the end of a narrative chapter in my life that I didn't really want to start. It has been a bit of a mental three years and 680 days since I was diagnosed. ""Rowing has been the constant for me when things were changing and always provided the goal. I just pass a lot of the credit on to my team-mates. The belief in myself might have run out at some point but they never let it happen."" GB's Caddick and Murray took PR3 mixed double sculls silver, behind Australia’s Nikki Ayers and Jed Altschwager. There are 61 gold medals to be won at the Paris 2024 Paralympics on Monday, with live text coverage available on the BBC Sport website and app. Dan Bethell (men's SL3 singles - 12:00 BST) and Krysten Coombs (men's SH6 singles - 21:00) are in Para-badminton finals, bidding to win Great Britain's first Paralympic medals in the sport.

1912,RFK Jr sues to remove name from North Carolina ballot,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has sued North Carolina’s election board to get his name off the state’s ballot ahead of November's US presidential election, just months after he fought to have his name included in several states. Mr Kennedy filed the lawsuit on Friday after the North Carolina Election Board denied his request to remove his name as a third-party candidate. The former independent candidate suspended his campaign in August and endorsed the Republican nominee, former president Donald Trump. Since then, he has fought to remove his name from ballots in several battleground states, saying he wants to avoid a Democratic win in those key races. The lawsuit, filed in North Carolina’s Wake County Superior Court, alleges the state has “irreparably harmed” Mr Kennedy and interfered with his right to free speech by denying his request to be removed from the ballot. Mr Kennedy’s lawsuit stated that with ballot deadlines looming, he had “no choice but to turn to this Court for immediate relief”. The state’s majority Democratic board voted to deny his request earlier in the week, saying it would be impractical to remove him as some counties have already begun printing absentee ballots. A reprint, they said, would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The two Republican members on the board disagreed, and argued that the state could delay the statutory deadline for absentee ballots being sent out. Mr Kennedy’s name will appear on North Carolina’s ballot in November unless the court intervenes. Similar requests by Mr Kennedy to have his name taken off ballots in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin have also been denied. These requests mark a reversal for Mr Kennedy, who earlier this year fought against legal challenges that would have removed him from the ballot in several states, including in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Nevada. After his withdrawal from the race, the 70-year-old has said that he will work to remove his name in “battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler”. Since suspending his campaign, Mr Kennedy has thrown his support behind Trump, who has vowed to appoint Mr Kennedy as a member of his presidential transition team should he get elected. Mr Kennedy, who had been a member of the Democratic party for most of his life, added that “by staying on the ballot in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats, with whom I disagree on the most existential issues”. Meanwhile, he is trying to remain on the ballot in New York - a traditionally Blue state that favours Democratic candidates - where his presence likely would not alter the election’s outcome.",2024-09-01 23:09:44,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgw9dg55l9o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1910,Paralympics triathlon postponed because of water quality,"Dave Ellis (left), with guide Luke Pollard, is a leading British medal hope in the Paris 2024 para-triathlon The Para-triathlon events at the Paris 2024 Paralympics have been postponed by 24 hours because of poor water quality in the River Seine. All 11 triathlon races had been due to take place on Sunday but heavy rain in Paris has caused water quality in the Seine to drop, World Triathlon said in a statement. The events will now take place on Monday, subject to further tests. It is the latest difficulty for Paris 2024 organisers surrounding Olympic and Paralympic events taking place in the River Seine. The Olympic triathlon events were subject to several delays caused by heavy rain during the early stages of the Games. And the Paralympic triathlon was originally supposed to take place over two days - Sunday 1 and Monday, 2 September - before all the events were switched to Sunday because of the forecast of bad weather. That weather arrived earlier than expected, meaning the triathlon is now due to happen on Monday - the day initially vacated by organisers. Five golds among 10 GB medals on sensational Saturday What's happening and when at Paris Paralympics? A statement from World Triathlon confirmed the decision to postpone was made after tests at 02:30 BST on Sunday - just under five hours before races were due to begin. ""The latest tests show a decrease in water quality in the river following the rain episodes over the last two days,"" the statement read, external. ""As a result, the water quality at the competition venue on Sunday, 1 September is not suitable for swimming and above the threshold established by World Triathlon. ""It has been decided to schedule all 11 Para-triathlon medal events on 2 September. This is subject to the forthcoming water tests complying with the established World Triathlon thresholds for swimming. ""Paris 2024 and World Triathlon reiterate that their priority is the health of the athletes and with these conditions, the Para-triathlon events cannot take place today."" Great Britain has 11 athletes competing across seven of the triathlon events at the 2024 Paralympics. These include reigning PTS5 women's Paralympic champion Lauren Steadman, who is set to defend her gold against team-mate Claire Cashmore.

However, Scheffler made uncharacteristic errors as he recorded successive bogeys on the seventh and eighth holes that allowed Morikawa, who birdied the fourth, sixth and eighth holes, to close to within two. A wayward drive left Scheffler hacking out from underneath a conifer tree down the left of the seventh, while he mis-hit a greenside bunker shot on the eighth that squirted out right and ended up further away from the hole. ""I was a bit frustrated because it was quite a basic shot, but I've shanked it from a similar lie before,"" he said. ""Ted [Scott, Scheffler's caddie] did a good job of helping me reset. He gave me a nice pep talk there on the back of the eighth green because I looked at him like, 'man, I don't know about this, this isn't looking so hot right now'. ""He gave me a little pep talk and then I was able to hit a really nice iron shot in there [on nine] and got things rolling. ""He really is a huge part of the team. I don't know if I'd be able to do any of this without him on my bag. ""And then I did some really nice stuff to finish this tournament off."" That ""nice stuff"" started on the ninth hole with a birdie, and two more followed on the 10th and 11th as Scheffler surged four clear. Morikawa responded with a birdie on the 13th, but Scheffler drained a 15-foot eagle putt on the next to re-establish his five-shot lead,  and he parred his way home to secure his first FedEx Cup title. ""Nothing fazes him,"" said Morikawa, who collected $12.5m for finishing runner-up. ""Whether I was gaining some ground or he was gaining ground, it didn't change how he walked or how he played or how he went through every shot. ""That's something to learn. His mental game is a lot stronger than a lot of people know."" Sunday's prize money takes Scheffler's official earnings for the season to around $54m and he has broken the PGA Tour record in that respect for a third season in a row. It has also been quite the year off the course for Scheffler, who became a father for the first time in May and then just days later was arrested on the morning of the second round of the US PGA Championship for an alleged traffic offence as he arrived at the course. He was taken to the police station and charged with assaulting a police officer but made it back to the course in time to play. All charges were later dropped.",2024-09-01 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cd6ypq8endpo,Peter Scrivener,2024-09-01 21:09:47,,True
1943,Tim Walz unharmed after vehicles in motorcade crash,"Multiple cars travelling in the motorcade carrying Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice-president, crashed in Milwaukee.  Mr Walz was not hurt. The crash happened around 13:00 local time (18:00BST) on Monday. The cars involved were at the rear of the motorcade and were carrying members of the press who travel with Mr Walz. Reporters said they were ""violently thrown forward"" after being hit from behind, sending their vehicle into the car in front of them. At least one person was injured. It is unclear what caused the crash, which occurred on Interstate 794. Vice-President Kamala Harris, his running mate, phoned Mr Walz to check that he was OK, a White House official told CBS, the BBC's US partner. Mr Walz said he also received a call from President Joe Biden. One person appeared to have broken an arm and was being treated by medics, according to pool reporter travelling with Mr Walz. The affected vehicles pulled over to the side of the road as Mr Walz continued ahead to a scheduled appearance. Mr Walz addressed the incident in his remarks at a Milwaukee Labor Day event shortly after the crash.  ""Some of my staff and members of the press that were travelling up with us were involved in a traffic accident on the way here today. We’ve spoken with the staff,"" he told the crowd. ""I’m relieved to say that with a few minor injuries, everybody’s going to be okay.” Mr Walz thanked the Secret Service and local first responders ""for their quick reaction to help"". Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance also responded to the reports, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, ""Hoping everyone's OK."" It's not the first time the campaign has faced a motorcade-related crash.  Last week, a Georgia policeman crashed his motorcycle while travelling with the campaign convoy.  The officer, Savannah Police Corporal David Bates, was the only person involved in the crash and sustained ""serious injuries"".  NPR reported that motorcade vehicles are often driven by campaign staff who may or may not have professional driving experience.

1937,"Netanyahu not doing enough to free Gaza hostages, says Biden","Joe Biden has said Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire with Hamas, amid reports suggesting a new proposal would be sent to the Israeli prime minister as ""final"".  The US president and Kamala Harris, his vice-president, met negotiators in the Situation Room to hammer out a proposal, as protests engulfed Israel on Monday over the weekend deaths of six hostages in Gaza. Asked whether Mr Netanyahu was doing enough, Mr Biden replied ""no"". He added that the US would not give up, and would ""push as hard as we can"" for a deal.  US officials have categorised this latest proposal as a ""take it or leave it deal"", the Washington Post reported. It comes after Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza on Saturday, including Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Their deaths have caused widespread protests in Israel from those critical of Mr Netanyahu's handling of the war and hostage crisis. During Monday's meeting in the Situation Room, US officials said Mr Biden and Ms Harris discussed next steps in the effort to release of the hostages, including continuing talks with co-mediators Qatar and Egypt. In a statement after, Mr Biden said the US was ""devastated and outraged"" by the death of Mr Goldberg-Polin and the five others. ""Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,"" he said. On Sunday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan met the US families of remaining hostages. The Axios news website reported that he relayed the news that Mr Biden would present a ""final"" hostage release and ceasefire proposal later this week. The US family of Edan Alexander, a member of the Israeli military who is still a hostage in Gaza, have pushed for Israel to accept the deal, saying it is ""now or never"". His father Adi Alexander praised the US for its ""dedication and commitment"" to secure a deal, saying that Sunday was his 15th meeting with Mr Sullivan since his son's abduction on 7 October. But in an interview with BBC’s US partner CBS News on Monday, he appealed to US officials to ""do something different, because the outcome is the same after 11 months"". Mr Alexander accused Mr Netanyahu of ""prolonging the war for short-term political gain"". ""Time is passing by and we're getting more bodies out of Gaza. This is unacceptable,"" he said. The Washington Post reported the killing of the six hostages increased the urgency among Mr Biden's aides to push for a deal. ""You can't keep negotiating this. This process has to be called at some point,"" one senior official told the newspaper. ""Does it derail the deal? No. If anything, it should add additional urgency in this closing phase, which we were already in,"" they added. The US, Qatar and Egypt have for months tried to secure a deal that includes a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The Biden administration has criticised Hamas for failing to agree to a deal, though US foreign officials have also accused Mr Netanyahu of making demands that have also derailed efforts. The war in the strip began after Hamas breached the Gaza border, killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted 251 on 7 October. Israel has since killed over 40,000 Palestinians in retaliatory attacks, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The US response to the war has had implications for the Biden administration and Ms Harris, the Democratic nominee in November's US presidential election. Pro-Palestinian factions in the party have urged for a ceasefire.  Ms Harris's opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump, has blamed Ms Harris and Mr Biden's failure to secure a deal for the hostage deaths last weekend.",2024-09-02 23:10:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2np7p1yr7o,Unknown,Unknown,,True

The 17-time gold medallist across swimming and cycling opted out of the track programme to concentrate on the road and she starts her campaign for gold number 18 in the C5 time trial (from 07:00) – an event where she has won gold at every Games since her cycling debut in 2008. The women’s B time trial could also be a good one for GB with Tokyo silver medallists Lora Fachie and Corrine Hall and the 2023 world silver medallists Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl aiming for gold. Ben Watson, Jaco van Gass and Fin Graham will be aiming for a clean sweep in the men’s C3 time trial while Archie Atkinson will be chasing hard in the C4 event. Storey is competing at her ninth Games - a British Paralympic record Scottish wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn will be hoping to become the first non-Chinese athlete to win the T53 100m title (19:36) since Tanni Grey-Thompson triumphed in Athens in 2004. Kinghorn won world gold in 2023 but China’s Fang Gao and Hongzhuan Zhou and Switzerland’s Catherine Debrunner will be big dangers. Another Scot Stephen Clegg should be among the main challengers in the S12 100m freestyle final (16:30) while Poppy Maskill and Olivia Newman-Baronius are the fastest two in the world this year in the SM14 200m IM (16:51) and Rhys Darbey and William Ellard could figure in the men’s race (16:43).

Germany’s Markus Rehm – best known as the Blade Jumper – will start as strong favourite to win his fourth Paralympic long jump title in the T64 category (18:26). Rehm, who lost his right leg below the knee in a wakeboarding accident in 2003 and jumps using a bladed prosthesis, has been the star of Para-athletics, constantly pushing the boundaries of his event. However, he is unable to compete at the Olympics because it was ruled that jumping off his prosthesis gives him an advantage over non-amputees. His current world record stands at 8.72m – the ninth longest jump of all time. His 2024 best is 8.44m – a distance which would have won Olympic silver in Paris and gold at the previous four Games. As well as standard racing bikes with modifications where required and tandems, the Para-cycling road programme also features handcycling and trike races. A handcycle has three wheels and riders use the strength of their upper limbs to operate the chainset. It is used by cyclists with spinal cord injuries or with one or both lower limbs amputated. Tricycles are used by riders with locomotor dysfunction and balance issues such as cerebral palsy or hemiplegia. Medal events: 63 Para-athletics (women’s F35 shot put, T38 long jump, F57 shot put, T37 100m, F64 shot put, T63 long jump, T12 100m, T53 400m, T54 400m, F33 shot put; men’s T12 400m, T13 400m, F11 discus, F64 discus, T11 100m, T53 800m, F35 shot put, T54 800m, F13 javelin); Shooting Para-sport (R6 - mixed 50m rifle prone SH1); Para-swimming (women’s SB7 100m breaststroke, S10 400m freestyle, SB11 100m breaststroke, SM9 200m IM, SB13 100m breaststroke, SB12 100m breaststroke, S8 50m freestyle; men’s S5 50m freestyle, S6 100m freestyle, SB11 100m breaststroke, SM9 200m IM, SB13 100m breaststroke; mixed 4x50m medley – 20 point), Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 50kg, up to 55kg; men’s up to 59kg, up to 65kg); Boccia (mixed BC1/2 team, mixed BC3 pairs, mixed BC4 pairs); Wheelchair tennis (women’s doubles; quad singles); Para-table tennis (men’s MS2 singles, MS3 singles, MS11 singles; women’s WS7 singles, WS11 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s foil team; men’s foil team); Para-cycling road (men’s H1-2 road race, H3 road race, H4 road race, H5 road race; women’s H1-4 road race, H5 road race); Goalball (women’s final, men’s final), Para-archery (mixed team recurve open); Para-judo (women -48kg J1, -48kg J2, -57kg J1; men -60 kg J1, -60 kg J2) GB will be hoping for success at different ends of the experience scale on day eight in Paris. Discus thrower Dan Greaves will be hoping to win his seventh medal at his seventh Games in the F64 event (18:04), having made his debut in Sydney in 2000 aged 18 and winning a gold, two silvers and three bronzes over his career. Team-mate Harrison Walsh will also be challenging for a medal. And in the pool, 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith, the youngest member of the GB team, has a strong chance of a medal in the SB7 100m breaststroke (16:30) at her first Games. It could be a good day for the GB throwers. Along with Greaves and Walsh, Dan Pembroke defends his F13 javelin title (19:45) having won two world titles since his gold in Tokyo in 2021 while Funmi Oduwaiye will hope to challenge in the F64 women’s shot put (10:43). A throw around her season’s best of 11.82m could put the former basketball player in the medal mix and Anna Nicholson will be hoping for a first major medal in the F35 shot put (09:00), having smashed her PB earlier this summer. Also in the field, Olivia Breen in the T38 long jump (09:04) and Sammi Kinghorn in the T53 400m (18:25) on the track will be aiming to add to their Paralympic medals. Pembroke was an Olympic hopeful but a degenerative eye condition saw him step away from the sport for a time Shooter Matt Skelhon won Paralympic gold on his debut in Beijing in 2008 and goes into the R6 mixed 50m rifle prone SH1 event as reigning world and European champion and will be aiming to hold all three titles at once (qualifying 08:30, final 10:45). In the pool, Becky Redfern will be cheered on by four-year-old son Patrick as she hopes to make it third time lucky in the SB13 100m breaststroke (18:22) after silvers in Rio and Tokyo. Powerlifters Olivia Broome and Mark Swan will be hoping for medals in the women’s -50kg (11:00) and men’s -65kg (17:35) events while the boccia team finals take place with GB hoping to figure in the BC1/2 team (16:00) and the BC3 mixed pairs (20:00) and the men’s basketball semi-finals will ensure plenty of excitement (15:00 and 20:30). Sprinter Timothee Adolphe is one of the big home hopes for success at the Stade de France and he will be aiming to shine in the T11 100m final (18:08) for athletes with little or no vision. As well as his athletics career, Adolphe is also a talented hip hop artist and was signed up by fashion house Louis Vuitton for a Games advertising campaign where he joined Olympic swimming star Leon Marchand. In the pool, Germany’s Elena Semechin and American Ali Truwit will both be hoping to claim medals after challenging times. Semechin won gold at Tokyo 2020 under her maiden name of Krawzow but months later was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Now back to full fitness, she goes in the SB12 100m breaststroke (18:29). Truwit could be a big challenger in the 400m S10 freestyle final (16:50) just over a year after losing her leg below the knee in a shark attack in the Caribbean. Boccia is one of two Paralympic sports – along with goalball – which does not have an Olympic counterpart. Similar to petanque, it is played by athletes in wheelchairs who have an impairment that affects their motor function.  The name comes from the Italian word for ‘ball’ and the sport made its Paralympic debut in 1984 and is played by athletes from more than 70 countries.

GB will hope to continue their dominance in the Para-equestrian team test (from 08:30) having won every gold since it was introduced into the Games in 1996. It could also be a big day in the wheelchair fencing at the Grand Palais with Piers Gilliver aiming to retain his epee A crown (19:50) and both Dimitri Coutya in the epee B (18:40) and Gemma Collis in the women’s epee A (20:25) also in good form.  Hewett is playing at his third Paralympics Alfie Hewett has won everything in wheelchair tennis, apart from a Paralympic gold medal, and he and Gordon Reid will hope to figure in the men’s doubles decider (from 12:30) after winning silver in both Rio and Tokyo. Table tennis player Will Bayley will hope to be involved in the MS7 singles final (18:15) and win again after Rio gold and Tokyo silver while Rio champion Rob Davies and Tokyo bronze medallist Tom Matthews could figure in the MS1 singles decider (13:00).

Bethany Firth won three golds in the event – one for Ireland in 2012 before switching nationalities and triumphing for GB in Rio and Tokyo but she will not be in Paris having recently given birth. US sprinter Hunter Woodhall watched on proudly in Paris in August as his wife Tara Davis-Woodhall won Olympic long jump gold and he will hope to match her achievement in the T62 400m (18:33) His Paralympic plans were hampered by a bout of Covid after the Olympics but Woodhall, who claimed bronze in the event in Tokyo, will be hoping to be fully fit. Dutch wheelchair tennis star Diede de Groot will be favourite to retain her women’s singles title at Roland Garros (from 12:30) after a 2024 which has already yielded Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles. And in the pool, Italy’s Simone Barlaam will be hoping for another successful night in the S9 100m butterfly (17:34) with Ireland’s Barry McClements bidding to figure. Para-equestrian teams are made up three athletes, at least one of which must be a Grade I, II or III and no more than two athletes within a team may be the same grade. Each combination rides the set test for their grade, which is scored as per the individual test – no scores are carried over from the previous test. The scores of all three team members are combined to produce a team total, and the nation with the highest total takes gold. In Grade I to III, athletes ride in smaller dressage arenas compared with Grade IV to V, and the difficulty of tests increases with the grade. Grade I athletes perform tests at a walk, while Grades II and III can walk and trot. In Grades IV and V, they perform tests at a walk, trot, cantor and do lateral work. Medal events: 75 Para-athletics (men’s T13 long jump, F34 shot put, T34 800m, T35 200m, T37 200m, T36 100m, F41 javelin, F33 shot put, T20 long jump, T38 1500m, T64 200m, F63 shot put, T47 400m; women’s F54 javelin, T13 400m, F40 shot put, T11 200m, T12 200m, T47 200m, T34 800m, T38 400m, T63 100m); Para-cycling road (women’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; men’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; mixed H1-5 team relay); Para-canoe (men’s KL1, KL2, KL3; women’s VL2, VL3); Para-equestrian (Grade I freestyle test, Grade II freestyle test, Grade III freestyle test, Grade IV freestyle test, Grade V freestyle test); Para-judo (men’s -90kg J1, -90kg J2, +90kg J1, +90kg J2, women’s +70kg J1, +70kg J2); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 73kg, up to 79kg; men’s up to 88kg, up to 97kg); Wheelchair tennis (men’s singles); Para-swimming (men’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S12 100m butterfly, S3 200m freestyle; women’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S11 100m freestyle, SM5 200m IM; mixed 34 point 4x100m freestyle relay); Para-table tennis (men’s MS4 singles, MS8 singles, MS9 singles; women’s WS4 singles, WS6 singles, WS8 singles, WS9 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s epee team, men’s epee team); Wheelchair basketball (men’s final), Blind football (final), Sitting volleyball (women’s final) The final day of the track athletics programme should see two of Britain’s most successful and high-profile athletes in action. Hannah Cockroft goes in as favourite for the T34 800m (19:20) – an event where she is two-time defending champion and unbeaten in the event at major championships since 2014. Shot putter Aled Sion Davies took bronze in the event at London 2012 but is unbeaten ever since and goes into the F63 final (19:25) as number one in the world while Zak Skinner will hope to make up for fourth in Tokyo with a medal in the T13 long jump (09:00). Tokyo gold medal-winning canoeist Emma Wiggs will be hoping to retain her VL2 title (10:52) while Charlotte Henshaw, who also won gold in Tokyo, and winter Paralympian Hope Gordon could be fighting it out in the VL3 event (11:36) – a new addition to the programme in Paris. Hannah Cockroft holds the world record in the T34 800m Britain’s three judoka will all be in action – Tokyo gold medallist Chris Skelley in the +90kg J2 division (final 17:13) after Dan Powell and Evan Molloy bid for glory in the -90kg J1 (14:32) and 90kg J2 (16:09) divisions. Ben Watson and Fin Graham could fight it out again in the men’s C1-3 road race (from 08:30) after winning gold and silver in Tokyo while Daphne Schrager and Fran Brown go in the women’s race. The Para-equestrian events conclude with the freestyle events (from 08:30) involving the top eight combinations in each grade from the individual tests earlier in the programme. The final night of the swimming could see butterfly success for both Alice Tai in the women’s S8 100m event (17:07) and for Stephen Clegg in the men’s S12 100m (18:23) – the latter was edged out for gold in Tokyo by 0.06 seconds. Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid will be hoping to figure in the men’s singles medal matches in the wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros (from 12:30) while at the Bercy Arena, the men’s wheelchair basketball programme comes to a climax (20:30). American Ellie Marks was due to compete at the 2014 Invictus Games in London but instead a respiratory infection left her in a coma in Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. She recovered and after winning four golds at the Invictus Games in 2016 presented one of the gold medals to the hospital staff who saved her life. She made her Paralympic debut in Rio, winning breaststroke gold and in Tokyo claimed S6 backstroke gold and will aim to defend her title (16:53). Italy will hope for another Para-athletics clean sweep in the T63 100m (20:22) where Ambra Sabatini, Martina Caironi and Monica Contrafatto finished in the medal positions in Tokyo and again at the 2023 and 2024 Worlds. And at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, Brazil will be hoping to continue their dominance in the blind football tournament in the gold-medal match (19:00). Blind football teams are made up of four outfield players and one goalkeeper, who is sighted. Matches are divided into two 20-minute halves and played on a pitch measuring 40 metres x 20 metres with boards running down both sidelines to keep the ball, which has rattles built in so players can locate it, within the field of play. In attack, the footballers are aided by a guide who stands behind the opposition goal. Spectators are asked to stay silent during play and when players move towards an opponent, go in for a tackle or are searching for the ball, they say ""voy"" or a similar word. Medal events: 14 Para-athletics (men’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon; women’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon); Para-canoe (women’s KL1, KL2, KL3; men’s VL2, VL3); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 86kg, over 86kg; men’s up to 107kg, over 107kg); Wheelchair basketball (women’s final) On the final day, action returns to the streets of the French capital with the marathons (from 07:00) which will include a 185-metre climb and link Seine-Saint-Denis, the area at the heart of the Games, and central Paris. As the race nears its end, the competitors will pass through Place de la Concorde, which hosted the opening ceremony, before heading up the Champs-Elysees and its cobbles to the Arc de Triomphe and the finish line at the Esplanade des Invalides, which was also the Olympic marathon finish. Eden Rainbow-Cooper made a major breakthrough when she won the Boston Marathon in April and will hope to shine on the Paris streets along with David Weir who famously won in London but was fifth in Tokyo after failing to finish in Rio. GB will be hoping for canoe success with defending KL2 champion Charlotte Henshaw and KL3 champion Laura Sugar both hoping to be on top of the podium again (10:41 and 11:07) and could model and Mr England winner Jack Eyers land a medal in the VL3 final (11:33)? Eyers chose to have his right leg amputated aged 16 and was the first amputee to be crowned Mr England The final day of powerlifting sees the heavyweights take to the stage – the women’s up to 86kg (09:35) and over 86kg divisions (13:00) and the men’s up to 107kg (08:00) and over 107kg (14:35) - the final gold medal before the closing ceremony. In the over 107kg division in Tokyo, Jordan’s Jamil Elshebli and Mansour Pourmirzaei of Iran both lifted 241kg – almost 38 stone in old money - with Elshebli winning gold on countback. China’s Deng Xuemei lifted 153kg to take the women’s over 86kg and you can expect plenty of big lifts again this time around. The women’s wheelchair basketball also takes centre stage with the Netherlands aiming to retain the title they won for the first time in Tokyo (final 12:45).",2024-09-02 23:11:00,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg4y131ge2ko,Elizabeth Hudson,2024-09-02 23:11:00,,True
1950,Transgender sprinter fails to reach Paralympic final,"Valentina Petrillo will also compete in the 200m later in the Games Transgender athlete Valentina Petrillo failed to reach the T12 400m final at the Paris Paralympics after finishing third in her semi-final. The 51-year-old Italian sprinter competed in the women's T12 classification on Monday, for athletes with visual impairments.  She finished second in her heat with a time of 58.35 seconds, 1.38secs behind Venezuela's Alejandra Paola Perez Lopez, to qualify for the semi-finals later on Monday. Despite recording a personal best time of 57.58 in her semi-final, she again finished behind Perez Lopez, while Iran's Hajar Safarzadeh Ghahderijani won in a time of 56.07. Petrillo had qualified sixth fastest for the semi-finals - 2.99secs behind top qualifier and world record holder Omara Durand from Cuba. The final is on Tuesday at 11:14 BST. Petrillo is also competing in the women's T12 200m in Paris, which gets under way on Friday. Speaking to BBC Sport before the Games, Petrillo, who transitioned in 2019, said her participation in Paris would be an ""important symbol of inclusion"". After Monday's heat, she added: ""The atmosphere in the stadium is great, it's just a dream come true. ""From today I don't want to hear anything more about discrimination, prejudices against transgender people."" Currently, there is no unified position in sport towards transgender inclusion. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) allows international sport governing bodies to set their own policies. IPC president Andrew Parsons told BBC Sport that, while Petrillo would be ""welcome"" in Paris under current World Para Athletics policies, he wants to see the sporting world ""unite"" on its transgender policies. It had been reported Petrillo was the first openly transgender athlete to compete at the Paralympics. But the IPC has since told the BBC Dutch transgender athlete Ingrid van Kranen, who died in 2021, finished ninth in the women's discus final at the Rio 2016 Games. Van Kranen's story was not widely known at the time. Mariuccia Quilleri, a lawyer and athlete who has represented a number of fellow athletes who opposed Petrillo's participation in women's races, said inclusion had been chosen over fairness and ""there is not much more we can do"". Tokyo 2020 silver medallist Ukraine Oksana Boturchuk, who reached Tuesday's final, said: ""I find this not fair, in my opinion. I am not against transgenders in general but in this situation I do not understand and don't support it."" Venezuela's Paralympic Committee (VPC) has called it a ""a terrible inequality that puts female athletes (born female) at a great disadvantage"". General secretary Johan Marin told BBC Sport: ""We are completely against discrimination, inequality and/or exclusion of any person or group in any social sphere. ""Therefore, respect for individual rights, inclusion and equality must always prevail."" Marin called for an open category for transgender athletes to compete in, calling it the ""fairest and most sensible thing"". Petrillo won 11 national titles in the male T12 category for athletes with visual impairment between 2015 and 2018. With her wife's support, in 2018 she started living as a woman, and in January 2019 she began hormone therapy. In 2021, the Italian said in an interview with the BBC that her metabolism changed, resulting in her not being ""the energetic person"" that she was prior to the hormone therapy, which resulted in her times being slower. That year, more than 30 female athletes signed a petition that was sent by Quilleri to the president of the Italian Athletics Federation and the ministries for Equal Opportunities and Sport challenging Petrillo's right to compete in women's races. Last year, Petrillo won two bronze medals at the World Para Athletics Championships. There are significant differences between World Athletics' policies and those of World Para Athletics. World Athletics has banned transgender women from competing in the female category at international events. Its president, Lord Coe, said the decision was to ""maintain fairness for female athletes above all other consideration"". Under World Para Athletics' rules, a person who is legally recognised as a woman is eligible to compete in the category their impairment qualifies them for.

1959,Saddling up on the high seas - the cyclists powering 50-mph yachts,"Saddling up on the high seas - the cyclists powering 50-mph yachts Sitting on a bike and pedalling is something Simon van Velthooven has done for countless kilometres and hours during his cycling career. He has done it well, winning Olympic, World and Commonwealth medals on the track. He still pedals a bike for a living, but the New Zealander's life as a 'cyclor' on a sailing boat in the America's Cup is now very different. ""You're just getting shaken around, holding on while you're turning some cranks that are veering a lot,"" Van Velthooven tells BBC Sport. ""It's RPM [revolutions per minute], power, watts, cadence, shaking, high turbulence, getting punch-drunk by whacking your head on the walls and trying to look at your numbers on your screen, and listening to all the comms of the sailors and what they're doing and trying to anticipate your energy levels coming up to the next manoeuvre."" Van Velthooven is among the wave of cycling experts that have crossed over to the world of sailing before the 37th edition of the America's Cup - the oldest international sailing competition in the world - this autumn in Barcelona. Traditionally everything above the waterline on the 75ft-long boats - the sails, mast and winches - was powered by grinders, sailors who used their arms to turn cranks. Yet technological rule changes for this year's competition have reduced crew sizes from 11 people to eight, but with the proviso that any body part can now be used to create power. As legs can typically produce more power than arms, cyclors have been brought in and static pedalling systems installed on the boats. Teams estimate they have since seen a 25-30% gain in watts produced per athlete by using the lower part of their body rather than upper. Cyclors are not entirely new. They were also used during in the 2017 staging of the America's Cup in Bermuda by Emirates Team New Zealand, which is how 35-year-old Van Velthooven was initially recruited to sailing from cycling. The Kiwis were outliers during that competition as the only crew to try the technology, although it was to great effect as they won the Cup. They retained the title in 2021 when rules required a return to grinders. This time around the cyclor technology is being used by all six competing teams. Van Velthooven (crouched, far right) was one of the cyclors on Emirates New Zealand's ground-breaking 2017 victory This year's America's Cup boats - known as AC75s - are ""designed to fly"" across the water on a foiling monohull, racing at speeds of up to 50 knots (58mph). For athletes with no experience of sailing, seasickness is an obvious first hurdle they need to overcome before they can become a cyclor. Two athletes were unwell during trials with New York Yacht Club American Magic and were dropped. ""They've got to be able to perform in somewhat high-G [force] situations when the boat's getting spun around,"" says Terry Hutchinson, president of sailing operations at American Magic. ""Then they've got to be able to perform day in, day out in the sun and heat of Barcelona. It takes quite a unique athlete to achieve that."" Cyclors are not built the same as the professional cyclists at the Tour de France or Olympics. For cyclists, body weight and watts per kilogram are key to how they perform. However, cyclors do not need to pull themselves up a mountain or around a track. They simply need to produce as big a wattage as possible when the boat needs it. ""There are some unique things we are looking for in this particular sport,"" says Ben Day, head performance coach of the American Magic team. ""When we're talking about Tour de France cyclists, we're maybe looking at someone who is 60kg up to 75-80kg. All of our guys are running 90kg and above. ""It's a bit of a unique skillset. We have guys who are super strong and we're just looking for absolute power."" Former cyclist Ashton Lambie, like Van Veltooven, has swapped over to sailing purely for his credentials on a bike. Lambie is a former individual pursuit world champion. In 2021, he became the first rider in history to break the four-minute barrier for a 4km-long effort round the track. He joined the American Magic team after a trial and his body shape has changed considerably over the last two years since. ""Even by cycling standards I was a fairly big guy, I am moderately well known for having big legs and they've gotten bigger since I've come here,"" Lambie says. ""During my racing career I was probably between 70 and 74kg, and now I've gained over 10kg. Most of it is muscle, and I've also gained watts. It's been a really big change."" Ashton Lambie won an individual pursuit world title in 2021 in Roubaix, but the 33-year-old now brings his power to a different kind of vehicle Lambie, 33, says the only similarity to cycling is that the cyclors are pedalling in the same motion as on a regular bike. ""The pedalling feels very different and the overall sensations of moving on the water, either laterally or vertically, is wildly different from any kind of cycling,"" Lambie says. ""When you go through a corner on the track the banking pulls you in and the G-force pushes down on you - that's a very natural feeling when you lean into the corner. ""But on a boat it's like you're upright and somebody just whips the boat around so you're getting slammed, it's a purely lateral load. ""It looks quite static and stable when you're watching it on TV but the boat really moves a lot. ""We do a lot of stability work and mobility work in the gym and that definitely translates over to the boat when you're getting jostled around a lot and you still need to be able to pedal. ""The times when the boat's a little unstable, you're getting thrown around the most, that's when it's most important to pedal. Being able to put out power even when you're not in an optimal pedalling position is huge."" Ineos Britannia lost out to Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli to be the challenger for the America's Cup the last time it was held, in 2021 The races take place across head-to-head events that are split into two parts.  The first part - the Louis Vuitton Cup - determines which of five challengers will face this year's defending champion Emirates Team New Zealand in the second, the America's Cup itself. Races take approximately 25 minutes and this year start in August and end in October. Endurance is the key metric for cyclors, who need to be able to consistently produce a high wattage during the races themselves and maintain their form across 10 weeks. ""We just want a huge reliable engine for the three months that we're going to be racing,"" Van Velthooven says. ""Big days are big days and easy days are still big days because they still need heaps of power. It's relentless."" The UK's Ineos Britannia team, led by Sir Ben Ainslie, might not have recruited professional cyclists to their crew like some of their rivals but they have the next best thing - an affiliation with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team, formerly Team Sky and winner of seven Tours de France. Matt Gotrel is part of Ineos Britannia's crew. This year will be his second America's Cup, but his first as a cyclor rather than grinder. A former Olympic gold medal-winning rower, having been part of Great Britain's eight at Rio 2016, Gotrel has found it a ""big challenge"" to train a different muscle group, even if recreationally he considered himself a cyclist already. ""As rowers, we had an upside-down pyramid [body shape] before, but it's flipped around now,"" Gotrel says. As grinders, his crew would aim to produce 400 watts of power over 20 minutes. As cyclors they are now ""well north of that"". Training for the past two years has predominantly taken place on the road or in the gym, rather than on water. Volume blocks can consist of four to six-hour-long rides, three times a week, interspersed with high-intensity intervals on a static bike and weight training. Gotrel, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, compares powering the boats in a race to a cycling time trial, but with repeated sprint efforts throughout. ""You want to have a really good aerobic base where you can sit at as high a power as possible without producing too much lactate, and then you have your big spikes and  need to be able to recover from those,"" he says. The connection to Ineos' cycling team has been a ""massive"" resource for Gotrel and his fellow cyclors, enabling them to share training and nutritional insight on a training camp in Spain together. ""I had a chat with [sprinter Elia] Viviani about some sprinting technique, and then there are Filippo Ganna and Dan Bigham who have been really good on some of the strategy and fuelling things and what they did to push on the hour record,"" says Gotrel Gotrel's training now takes in open roads as well as open water Hutchinson says the America's Cup is a ""design competition as much as a sailing competition"" and development of the boats has been a process lasting more than two and a half years. Part of the challenge has been incorporating the concept of a bike into a boat. Most teams have chosen to position the cyclors upright, as they would be on a regular bike - even if the 'bike' consists of just a seat, seatpost and crank. ""We started it by scanning a standard bike and putting that in a boat and seeing what position you'd need to put the cyclors in,"" says David Adcock, Ineos Britannia’s lead mechanic. ""Some of the ideas we came up with at the start looked really strange from a cycling perspective - head down pretty much touching your feet - but we kind of went away from that and have gone back to a standard bike position that was best for getting power out."" In order to maximise the aerodynamics, the cyclors are below deck. They don't have much to look at beyond a screen showing their data. ""Trying to get someone who's 6ft 3in to fit has been quite challenging,"" says Adcock. ""We've got handlebars that we can move up and down to get them packaged in properly."" By contrast, the American Magic team have chosen to put the cyclors in the recumbent position, lying almost flat on their backs. ""It's the America's Cup and so it takes clever thinking to be successful. I would look to Team New Zealand's success in 2017 - they were the outlier then and they won the regatta,"" Hutchinson says. ""We're not afraid to be different, we understand the power requirements of the boat."" Barcelona will become the first city in the world to host both an Olympic Games and the America's Cup Adcock describes the AC75 as like an ""F1 car on water"" and the links between the America's Cup and Formula 1 are easy to find. Ineos Britannia share their UK base with the Mercedes team - where Ineos is also a sponsor. Adcock previously spent 22 years working for Mercedes before moving across in 2022. American Magic have also spent time with the Williams team to see how they work. Each boat can produce more than 3,000 data points within half a second and send them to engineers onshore for analysis in real time. ""The steering wheels look more like an F1 wheel with the functions on the wheel and how the boat's programmed to automatically shift mode. That side of it is very similar,"" says Hutchinson. ""If you're good at Call of Duty [video game] you're probably really good at sailing an AC75 because it's a similar controller."" Ineos Britannia are aiming to become the first British challenger to win the America's Cup The technological advancements in the sport have taken the America's Cup far away from the experience of most traditional sailors. The return of cyclors for this year's race has moved that dial even further. ""It's hard for the average sailor to relate to what we're doing,"" admits Hutchinson, who has been part of five America's Cups. ""They look at the boat and there are a lot of traditionalists out there who say 'this actually isn't racing'. ""But I bet you and I couldn't hop into an F1 car and understand how to turn the thing on. We understand the concept of the car, we know we can drive a car, but we probably can't drive one of those cars. I equate it to that. ""The America's Cup is a unique competition, it's always been at the tip of the sphere of the sport."" The crossover of cycling into sailing might seem incongruous, but at the heart of the two sports is a very similar culture, Day believes. That shared ground has made blending the two so successful. ""There seems to be a correlation between sailors who love toys and boats and cyclists who love bikes and toys,"" says Day. ""We all have this sense of freedom of getting out into nature with the wind in our hair. “Whether it's on a boat or on a bike, it seems to be something we can enjoy together.” Fury, hope and changing gear with a sword - Ukraine's Paris preparations Paralysed by an ex-boyfriend, Otto rises as Paralympian How a Facebook advert changed a life and the look of a sport East meets west London - the mentor who changed Chelsea East v West - Germany's drug-fuelled Cold War for medals",2024-09-02 23:11:04,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4ngydm1x55o,Sophie Hurcom,Unknown,,True
1962,GB win six golds to continue bountiful Games,"Louise Fiddes became a Paralympic champion 15 minutes after watching her friend and Paris room-mate Ellie Challis win gold Great Britain won six gold medals on day five as ParalympicsGB continued their bountiful Games at Paris 2024. Triathletes David Ellis and Megan Richter won early golds for Great Britain, with swimmers Ellie Challis and Louise Fiddes also triumphant across 15 scintillating minutes in the pool. Stephen McGuire became a Paralympic champion in boccia, while Para-archers Nathan Macqueen and Jodie Grinham - the latter competing while seven months pregnant - won gold in mixed team compound open final. Elsewhere on Monday, Briton Claire Cashmore took silver and fellow triathletes Hannah Moore and Lauren Steadman won bronzes. Dan Bethell and Krysten Coombs won silvers in badminton, while there was heartbreak for sprinter Jonnie Peacock who finished fifth in the men's T64 100m final. Monday's results take GB's Paris gold tally to 29 and their overall medal count to 54 - second only to China (87 medals, including 43 golds), who have topped the table at the past five Games. GB's Ellis and Richter storm to triathlon gold in Paris Inspired McGuire wins boccia gold for GB Bethell and Coombs win Para-badminton silvers GB's Challis & Fiddes win swimming golds Pregnant archer Grinham wins Paralympic gold GB's Peacock finishes fifth in 100m final  Grinham and Macqueen won gold together at the European Para Cup earlier this year British Para-archer Jodie Grinham is a Paralympic champion - and she is also seven months pregnant. The 31-year-old, who beat team-mate Phoebe Paterson Pine to women's individual compound bronze on Sunday, took gold alongside Nathan Macqueen by beating Iran 155-151 in the mixed team compound final on Monday. Grinham - already a mum to toddler son Christian - has attracted worldwide media attention. Before yesterday's medal, Paris 2024 has been far from straightforward for the Welsh archer.  After a scare last week she had to attend a Parisian hospital for a check-up before being released and cleared to compete. After Grinham's success she told BBC Wales: ""All I wanted to do was jump up and down and cry and scream and shout. ""But being heavily pregnant, realistically the best thing to do was crouch down and take a second and then I could give hugs and things."" Stephen McGuire previously finished fourth on three occasions in competitions at Paralympic Games, at London 2012 and Rio 2016 It is incredible Great Britain's Stephen McGuire is even competing at Paris 2024, let alone winning a boccia gold medal. The 40-year-old was a late addition to the British squad for Paris 2024, having had to recover from a broken leg and knee sustained in a fall at his home in 2022. He also only learned of his selection on 1 July, months after the rest of his British team-mates. But the Scotsman put in a dominant performance in the BC4 men's individual final to beat Colombia's Edilson Chica 8-5 and secure his first Paralympic medal at his fourth Games, having previously finished fourth in three competitions at the event. McGuire said ""lots of hard work and lots of soul-searching"" helped him recover from his setbacks to win gold. ""If she can do it, I can do it."" Those were the words of Fiddes as she won gold for Great Britain in the S14m 100m breaststroke final, just 15 minutes after she watched her friend Challis dominate the women's S3 50m backstroke final. The two Britons are room-mates in Paris and both improved on the silver medals they won three years ago in Tokyo. Fiddes told Channel 4 before her race she was ""on the edge of her seat"" watching Challis, who she labelled a ""queen"". Challis, 20, swam a lifetime best of 53.56 seconds, almost five seconds clear of second-placed, while Fiddes, 23, held off Brazilian favourites Debora and Beatriz Carneiro to add to her bronze she won in the S14 200m freestyle on day three. Dave Ellis won gold alongside guide Luke Pollard GB's first gold of the day was won by Ellis and guide Luke Pollard in the men's PTVI triathlon event. The pair's victory more than made up for their DNF in Tokyo when they had to abandon with a mechanical failure on the bike leg. Paralympic debutant Richter added to GB's medal tally with victory in the women's PTS4 competition, with fellow Briton Moore third. In the women's PTS5 event Cashmore and Steadman won silver and bronze respectively. The pair have elaborate Paralympic histories. It has been a tough few years for Tokyo 2020 champion Steadman, who has suffered with long Covid and returned to triathlon after a spell in winter sports. Cashmore's medal haul now stands at 10, with a podium place at every Games since Athens 2004. Great Britain won 12 golds on day four in a record-breaking super Sunday, but to even match half that tally made day five a magic Monday. That said, there were still some moments of heartbreak for British athletes. Para-badminton player Bethell said he was ""devastated"" after a heartbreaking loss to India's Kumar Nitesh in the men's SL3 singles final in Paris. The Briton, who also took silver when the sport made its debut in Tokyo in 2021, had match point at 21-20 ahead in the decider, but lost 14-21 21-18 23-21. His team-mate Coombs lost his SH6 singles final later on Monday 21-19 21-13 to Frenchman Charles Noakes as Britain's wait for a first Paralympic badminton gold continued. Two-time Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock finished fifth in the men's T64 100m final. The 31-year-old told Channel 4 he needs to find ""2017 Jonnie"" to compete against the best. There was also disappointment for David Weir, who finished sixth in his heat and failed to qualify for the men's T54 1500m final, while GB's men's wheelchair rugby team lost their bronze-medal match 50-48 to Australia.

1987,Paralympian's proposal after 'exiting the darkness',"Alessandro Ossola had a surprise for his girlfriend Arianna after competing at the Paralympics on Sunday Italian sprinter Alessandro Ossola arrived at the Paris 2024 Paralympics looking for a gold medal, but he will leave with “something amazing” after proposing to his girlfriend in front of tens of thousands of fans in the Stade de France on Sunday. At the end of his race, just after missing a place in the final of the T63 100m, the 36-year-old took the opportunity for an unforgettable proposal. He ran to his parents and girlfriend Arianna in the stands, dropped to his knee and asked the question. “She answered me ‘You’re crazy, you’re crazy’ and she kissed me, so it was exciting really,” Ossola told the BBC World Service. “I was unlucky, I didn’t achieve the final and I was really sad about it. But after three minutes, you know life is strange, I was really happy.” This was a plan more than a month in the making. Ossola knew wherever he finished in his race, he had a lot more on the line in the French capital than his result. “I bought the ring, then I gave it to my friend to bring to me (at the end of the race),” he said. “The Paralympics is like an amazing contest, an amazing place to do it and she was so beautiful.” Alessandro and Arianna are set to celebrate their engagement in the French capital For Ossola, who lives in Turin and first competed at Tokyo 2020, his proposal had extra significance, given his journey and a life of incredible loss. A motorcycle accident in 2015 resulted in the death of his first wife and meant Ossola had to have most of his left leg amputated. It was a time where he says he could ""see just darkness"" around him. ""It’s a long journey, now I’m here I’m smiling,"" he added. ""I’m a positive guy but at the beginning [it] was a hard time. But sports help me exit this darkness, this turmoil."" Ossola credits his Para-athletics training with helping him focus on the future. He hopes the Paralympics can do much more in improving perceptions about disability in wider society. “I don’t like when the people say 'You are disabled, ah, you are going to Paralympics'. ""It’s not like that. You are going to the Paralympics if you are one of the best athletes in the world. This is why I am proud to be here."" For now, Ossola says his and Arianna's plans for the rest of their stay in Paris, as a newly engaged couple, will be simple. “For sure a good dinner,"" he said. ""We love Paris and Paris - the city of love - was the right city to ask her to be my wife.""",2024-09-03 23:11:37,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cp8nrn5r351o,Tom Donkin,2024-09-03 23:11:37,,True

1982,What's happening and when at Paris Paralympics?,"The Paris Paralympics are under way and you can plan how to follow the competition with our day-by-day guide - all times BST. A team of 215 athletes will represent ParalympicsGB in the French capital with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport.  At the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, held in 2021, the GB team finished second behind China in the medal table with 124 medals, including 41 golds. The Games began with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, 28 August, with the first medals decided the following day and action continuing until the closing ceremony on Sunday, 8 September.  Medal events: 63 Para-cycling road (women’s C1-3, C4, C5, B, H1-3, H4-5, T1-2 time trials; men’s C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, B, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, T1-2 time trials); Para-equestrian (Grade IV grand prix test, Grade V grand prix test); Para-swimming (men’s S12 100m freestyle, SM14 200m IM, S8 400m freestyle, SB2 50m breaststroke, S7 men’s 50m freestyle; women’s S12 100m freestyle, SM14 200m IM, S8 400m freestyle, SB3 50m breaststroke, S7 100m freestyle, S9 100m freestyle; mixed 49 point 4x100m freestyle relay); Para-athletics (women’s F41 discus, F46 shot put, F32 shot put, T36 100m, T53 100m, T54 100m; men’s F46 shot put, javelin F34, 400m T37, long jump T38, 100m T53, club throw F51, 100m T54, long jump T64, shot put F36); Wheelchair fencing (men’s foil category A, foil category B; women’s foil category A, foil category B); Para-powerlifting (women’s -41kg, -45kg; men’s -49kg, -54kg); Wheelchair tennis (quad doubles); Para-archery (men’s individual recurve open); Para-table tennis (women’s singles WS5, WS10, men’s singles MS10); Shooting Para-sport (P4 – mixed 50m pistol SH1, R9 mixed 50m rifle prone SH2) Day seven will be the first chance to see Britain’s most successful Paralympian Sarah Storey at Paris 2024. The 17-time gold medallist across swimming and cycling opted out of the track programme to concentrate on the road and she starts her campaign for gold number 18 in the C5 time trial (from 07:00) - an event where she has won gold at every Games since her cycling debut in 2008. The women's B time trial could also be a good one for GB with Tokyo silver medallists Lora Fachie and Corrine Hall and the 2023 world silver medallists Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl aiming for gold. Ben Watson, Jaco van Gass and Fin Graham will be aiming for a clean sweep in the men’s C3 time trial while Archie Atkinson will be chasing hard in the C4 event. Storey is competing at her ninth Games - a British Paralympic record Scottish wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn will be hoping to become the first non-Chinese athlete to win the T53 100m title (19:08) since Tanni Grey-Thompson triumphed in Athens in 2004. Kinghorn won world gold in 2023 but China's Fang Gao and Hongzhuan Zhou and Switzerland's Catherine Debrunner will be big dangers. Another Scot Stephen Clegg should be among the main challengers in the S12 100m freestyle final (16:30) while Poppy Maskill and Olivia Newman-Baronius are the fastest two in the world this year in the SM14 200m IM (16:50) and Rhys Darbey and Will Ellard could figure in the men’s race (16:42). Alice Tai has previously been a 50/100m specialist but swimming the Channel in 2023 has helped her grow to love the longer distances and she will hoping for a medal in the S8 400m freestyle (17:24) alongside Brock Whiston. Powerlifter Zoe Newson be hoping to lift her way to a third Paralympic medal when she goes in the -45kg division (16:00) while Para-equestrian rider Sophie Wells will also be aiming to add to her six individual medals in the Grade V grand prix test (11:55). GB's women will face the United States in their wheelchair basketball quarter-final (15:00) while the first wheelchair tennis medals will be decided at Roland Garros in the quad doubles with Andy Lapthorne and Greg Slade facing formidable Dutch duo Sam Schroder and Niels Vink for the gold. Germany's Markus Rehm - best known as the Blade Jumper - will start as strong favourite to win his fourth Paralympic long jump title in the T64 category (19:29). Rehm, who lost his right leg below the knee in a wakeboarding accident in 2003 and jumps using a bladed prosthesis, has been the star of Para-athletics, constantly pushing the boundaries of his event. However, he is unable to compete at the Olympics because it was ruled that jumping off his prosthesis gives him an advantage over non-amputees. His current world record stands at 8.72m - the ninth longest jump of all time. His 2024 best is 8.44m - a distance which would have won Olympic silver in Paris and gold at the previous four Games. As well as standard racing bikes with modifications where required and tandems, the Para-cycling road programme also features handcycling and trike races. A handcycle has three wheels and riders use the strength of their upper limbs to operate the chainset. It is used by cyclists with spinal cord injuries or with one or both lower limbs amputated. Tricycles are used by riders with locomotor dysfunction and balance issues such as cerebral palsy or hemiplegia. Medal events: 63 Para-athletics (women’s F35 shot put, T38 long jump, F57 shot put, T37 100m, F64 shot put, T63 long jump, T12 100m, T53 400m, T54 400m, F33 shot put; men’s T12 400m, T13 400m, F11 discus, F64 discus, T11 100m, T53 800m, F35 shot put, T54 800m, F13 javelin); Shooting Para-sport (R6 - mixed 50m rifle prone SH1); Para-swimming (women’s SB7 100m breaststroke, S10 400m freestyle, SB11 100m breaststroke, SM9 200m IM, SB13 100m breaststroke, SB12 100m breaststroke, S8 50m freestyle; men’s S5 50m freestyle, S6 100m freestyle, SB11 100m breaststroke, SM9 200m IM, SB13 100m breaststroke; mixed 4x50m medley – 20 point), Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 50kg, up to 55kg; men’s up to 59kg, up to 65kg); Boccia (mixed BC1/2 team, mixed BC3 pairs, mixed BC4 pairs); Wheelchair tennis (women’s doubles; quad singles); Para-table tennis (men’s MS2 singles, MS3 singles, MS11 singles; women’s WS7 singles, WS11 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s foil team; men’s foil team); Para-cycling road (men’s H1-2 road race, H3 road race, H4 road race, H5 road race; women’s H1-4 road race, H5 road race); Goalball (women’s final, men’s final), Para-archery (mixed team recurve open); Para-judo (women -48kg J1, -48kg J2, -57kg J1; men -60 kg J1, -60 kg J2) GB will be hoping for success at different ends of the experience scale on day eight in Paris. Discus thrower Dan Greaves will be hoping to win his seventh medal at his seventh Games in the F64 event (18:04), having made his debut in Sydney in 2000 aged 18 and winning a gold, two silvers and three bronzes over his career. Team-mate Harrison Walsh will also be challenging for a medal. And in the pool, 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith, the youngest member of the GB team, has a strong chance of a medal in the SB7 100m breaststroke (16:30) at her first Games. It could be a good day for the GB throwers. Along with Greaves and Walsh, Dan Pembroke defends his F13 javelin title (19:45) having won two world titles since his gold in Tokyo in 2021 while Funmi Oduwaiye will hope to challenge in the F64 women’s shot put (10:43). A throw around her season’s best of 11.82m could put the former basketball player in the medal mix and Anna Nicholson will be hoping for a first major medal in the F35 shot put (09:00), having smashed her PB earlier this summer. Also in the field, Olivia Breen in the T38 long jump (09:04) and Sammi Kinghorn in the T53 400m (18:25) on the track will be aiming to add to their Paralympic medals. Pembroke was an Olympic hopeful but a degenerative eye condition saw him step away from the sport for a time Shooter Matt Skelhon won Paralympic gold on his debut in Beijing in 2008 and goes into the R6 mixed 50m rifle prone SH1 event as reigning world and European champion and will be aiming to hold all three titles at once (qualifying 08:30, final 10:45). In the pool, Becky Redfern will be cheered on by four-year-old son Patrick as she hopes to make it third time lucky in the SB13 100m breaststroke (18:22) after silvers in Rio and Tokyo. Powerlifters Olivia Broome and Mark Swan will be hoping for medals in the women’s -50kg (11:00) and men’s -65kg (17:35) events while the boccia team finals take place with GB hoping to figure in the BC1/2 team (16:00) and the BC3 mixed pairs (20:00) and the men’s basketball semi-finals will ensure plenty of excitement (15:00 and 20:30). Sprinter Timothee Adolphe is one of the big home hopes for success at the Stade de France and he will be aiming to shine in the T11 100m final (18:08) for athletes with little or no vision. As well as his athletics career, Adolphe is also a talented hip hop artist and was signed up by fashion house Louis Vuitton for a Games advertising campaign where he joined Olympic swimming star Leon Marchand. In the pool, Germany’s Elena Semechin and American Ali Truwit will both be hoping to claim medals after challenging times. Semechin won gold at Tokyo 2020 under her maiden name of Krawzow but months later was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Now back to full fitness, she goes in the SB12 100m breaststroke (18:29). Truwit could be a big challenger in the 400m S10 freestyle final (16:50) just over a year after losing her leg below the knee in a shark attack in the Caribbean. Boccia is one of two Paralympic sports – along with goalball – which does not have an Olympic counterpart. Similar to petanque, it is played by athletes in wheelchairs who have an impairment that affects their motor function.  The name comes from the Italian word for ‘ball’ and the sport made its Paralympic debut in 1984 and is played by athletes from more than 70 countries.

Jeanette Chippington, the oldest member of the ParalympicsGB team in Paris aged 54, is among the GB Para-canoeists getting their campaigns under way – she goes in the heats of the VL2 (09:20) before the preliminaries of the KL1 (10:25). GB will hope to continue their dominance in the Para-equestrian team test (from 08:30) having won every gold since it was introduced into the Games in 1996. It could also be a big day in the wheelchair fencing at the Grand Palais with Piers Gilliver aiming to retain his epee A crown (19:50) and both Dimitri Coutya in the epee B (18:40) and Gemma Collis in the women’s epee A (20:25) also in good form.  Hewett is playing at his third Paralympics Alfie Hewett has won everything in wheelchair tennis, apart from a Paralympic gold medal, and he and Gordon Reid will hope to figure in the men’s doubles decider (from 12:30) after winning silver in both Rio and Tokyo. Table tennis player Will Bayley will hope to be involved in the MS7 singles final (18:15) and win again after Rio gold and Tokyo silver while Rio champion Rob Davies and Tokyo bronze medallist Tom Matthews could figure in the MS1 singles decider (13:00). Poppy Maskill will be aiming for gold in the pool in the S14 100m backstroke (18:08).

US sprinter Hunter Woodhall watched on proudly in Paris in August as his wife Tara Davis-Woodhall won Olympic long jump gold and he will hope to match her achievement in the T62 400m (18:33) His Paralympic plans were hampered by a bout of Covid after the Olympics but Woodhall, who claimed bronze in the event in Tokyo, will be hoping to be fully fit. Dutch wheelchair tennis star Diede de Groot will be favourite to retain her women’s singles title at Roland Garros (from 12:30) after a 2024 which has already yielded Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles. And in the pool, Italy’s Simone Barlaam will be hoping for another successful night in the S9 100m butterfly (17:34) with Ireland’s Barry McClements bidding to figure. Para-equestrian teams are made up three athletes, at least one of which must be a Grade I, II or III and no more than two athletes within a team may be the same grade. Each combination rides the set test for their grade, which is scored as per the individual test – no scores are carried over from the previous test. The scores of all three team members are combined to produce a team total, and the nation with the highest total takes gold. In Grade I to III, athletes ride in smaller dressage arenas compared with Grade IV to V, and the difficulty of tests increases with the grade. Grade I athletes perform tests at a walk, while Grades II and III can walk and trot. In Grades IV and V, they perform tests at a walk, trot, cantor and do lateral work. Medal events: 75 Para-athletics (men’s T13 long jump, F34 shot put, T34 800m, T35 200m, T37 200m, T36 100m, F41 javelin, F33 shot put, T20 long jump, T38 1500m, T64 200m, F63 shot put, T47 400m; women’s F54 javelin, T13 400m, F40 shot put, T11 200m, T12 200m, T47 200m, T34 800m, T38 400m, T63 100m); Para-cycling road (women’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; men’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; mixed H1-5 team relay); Para-canoe (men’s KL1, KL2, KL3; women’s VL2, VL3); Para-equestrian (Grade I freestyle test, Grade II freestyle test, Grade III freestyle test, Grade IV freestyle test, Grade V freestyle test); Para-judo (men’s -90kg J1, -90kg J2, +90kg J1, +90kg J2, women’s +70kg J1, +70kg J2); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 73kg, up to 79kg; men’s up to 88kg, up to 97kg); Wheelchair tennis (men’s singles); Para-swimming (men’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S12 100m butterfly, S3 200m freestyle; women’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S11 100m freestyle, SM5 200m IM; mixed 34 point 4x100m freestyle relay); Para-table tennis (men’s MS4 singles, MS8 singles, MS9 singles; women’s WS4 singles, WS6 singles, WS8 singles, WS9 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s epee team, men’s epee team); Wheelchair basketball (men’s final), Blind football (final), Sitting volleyball (women’s final) The final day of the track athletics programme should see two of Britain’s most successful and high-profile athletes in action. Hannah Cockroft goes in as favourite for the T34 800m (19:20) – an event where she is two-time defending champion and unbeaten in the event at major championships since 2014. Shot putter Aled Sion Davies took bronze in the event at London 2012 but is unbeaten ever since and goes into the F63 final (19:25) as number one in the world while Zak Skinner will hope to make up for fourth in Tokyo with a medal in the T13 long jump (09:00). Tokyo gold medal-winning canoeist Emma Wiggs will be hoping to retain her VL2 title (10:52) while Charlotte Henshaw, who also won gold in Tokyo, and winter Paralympian Hope Gordon could be fighting it out in the VL3 event (11:36) – a new addition to the programme in Paris. Hannah Cockroft holds the world record in the T34 800m Britain’s three judoka will all be in action – Tokyo gold medallist Chris Skelley in the +90kg J2 division (final 17:13) after Dan Powell and Evan Molloy bid for glory in the -90kg J1 (14:32) and 90kg J2 (16:09) divisions. Ben Watson and Fin Graham could fight it out again in the men’s C1-3 road race (from 08:30) after winning gold and silver in Tokyo while Daphne Schrager and Fran Brown go in the women’s race. The Para-equestrian events conclude with the freestyle events (from 08:30) involving the top eight combinations in each grade from the individual tests earlier in the programme. The final night of the swimming could see butterfly success for both Alice Tai in the women’s S8 100m event (17:07) and for Stephen Clegg in the men’s S12 100m (18:23) – the latter was edged out for gold in Tokyo by 0.06 seconds. Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid will be hoping to figure in the men’s singles medal matches in the wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros (from 12:30) while at the Bercy Arena, the men’s wheelchair basketball programme comes to a climax (20:30). American Ellie Marks was due to compete at the 2014 Invictus Games in London but instead a respiratory infection left her in a coma in Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. She recovered and after winning four golds at the Invictus Games in 2016 presented one of the gold medals to the hospital staff who saved her life. She made her Paralympic debut in Rio, winning breaststroke gold and in Tokyo claimed S6 backstroke gold and will aim to defend her title (16:53). Italy will hope for another Para-athletics clean sweep in the T63 100m (20:22) where Ambra Sabatini, Martina Caironi and Monica Contrafatto finished in the medal positions in Tokyo and again at the 2023 and 2024 Worlds. And at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, Brazil will be hoping to continue their dominance in the blind football tournament in the gold-medal match (19:00). Blind football teams are made up of four outfield players and one goalkeeper, who is sighted. Matches are divided into two 20-minute halves and played on a pitch measuring 40 metres x 20 metres with boards running down both sidelines to keep the ball, which has rattles built in so players can locate it, within the field of play. In attack, the footballers are aided by a guide who stands behind the opposition goal. Spectators are asked to stay silent during play and when players move towards an opponent, go in for a tackle or are searching for the ball, they say ""voy"" or a similar word. Medal events: 14 Para-athletics (men’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon; women’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon); Para-canoe (women’s KL1, KL2, KL3; men’s VL2, VL3); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 86kg, over 86kg; men’s up to 107kg, over 107kg); Wheelchair basketball (women’s final) On the final day, action returns to the streets of the French capital with the marathons (from 07:00) which will include a 185-metre climb and link Seine-Saint-Denis, the area at the heart of the Games, and central Paris. As the race nears its end, the competitors will pass through Place de la Concorde, which hosted the opening ceremony, before heading up the Champs-Elysees and its cobbles to the Arc de Triomphe and the finish line at the Esplanade des Invalides, which was also the Olympic marathon finish. Eden Rainbow-Cooper made a major breakthrough when she won the Boston Marathon in April and will hope to shine on the Paris streets along with David Weir who famously won in London but was fifth in Tokyo after failing to finish in Rio. GB will be hoping for canoe success with defending KL2 champion Charlotte Henshaw and KL3 champion Laura Sugar both hoping to be on top of the podium again (10:41 and 11:07) and could model and Mr England winner Jack Eyers land a medal in the VL3 final (11:33)? Eyers chose to have his right leg amputated aged 16 and was the first amputee to be crowned Mr England The final day of powerlifting sees the heavyweights take to the stage – the women’s up to 86kg (09:35) and over 86kg divisions (13:00) and the men’s up to 107kg (08:00) and over 107kg (14:35) - the final gold medal before the closing ceremony. In the over 107kg division in Tokyo, Jordan’s Jamil Elshebli and Mansour Pourmirzaei of Iran both lifted 241kg – almost 38 stone in old money - with Elshebli winning gold on countback. China’s Deng Xuemei lifted 153kg to take the women’s over 86kg and you can expect plenty of big lifts again this time around. The women’s wheelchair basketball also takes centre stage with the Netherlands aiming to retain the title they won for the first time in Tokyo (final 12:45).",2024-09-03 23:11:37,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg4y131ge2ko,Elizabeth Hudson,2024-09-03 23:11:37,,True
1984,'Recovery in my mental health makes me proud' - Tai,"Alice Tai has picked up a gold and bronze medal so far at the 2024 Paralympic Games. British Paralympian Alice Tai says she is ""so proud"" of her recovery from some of the ""worst"" moments in her mental health, prior to her recent gold and bronze medal success at the Paralympic games.  The 25-year-old, who was born in Poole, won her first individual Paralympic title on Saturday as Great Britain's swimmers claimed three gold medals within 40 minutes. After an emotional moment on the podium with her gold medal, Tai reflected back to the Rio Paralympics and the journey she has been on since.  In 2016, despite winning gold in the 4x100m medley, the swimmer revealed that it was one of her lowest points as she struggled with undiagnosed ADHD.  ""I'm not going to lie, Rio sucked,"" Tai told BBC Sport. ""My mental health was the worst it's ever been and I didn't want to be there, I didn't want to be alive to be honest. ""To have made such a recovery in my mental health and to have so much surgery over the last three years, I'm so proud of myself and so thankful to the team that support me.""  Alice Tai is competing for the chance to win five medals in total at this year's Paralympics.  Tai was born with clubfoot and in 2022 had an operation where her right leg was amputated from below the knee because of pain and discomfort. Over the weekend, she won gold in the S8 100m backstroke in a Paralympic record time of one minute 9.06 seconds.  She also picked up bronze in the SM8 200m individual medley on Sunday. ""For me the biggest thing about being a Paralympian is being able to advocate for disability,"" she said. ""I really want to break the stigma for my disability, just being here is doing that and I'm so privileged to be able to do that. ""I really hope that other people with disabilities, who might be a bit self conscious, can watch the Paralympics and see someone like them and the next day wake up with a bit more confidence in themselves."" Tai will go again in three more events as she competes in the 400m freestyle on Wednesday, the 50m freestyle on Thursday and the 100m butterfly on Saturday.

1979,China's mission to win African hearts with satellite TV,"As African leaders gather in Beijing this week for the triennial China-Africa summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping may have one thing under his belt to boast about - satellite TV. Almost nine years ago, President Xi promised the heads of state attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Johannesburg that China would provide over 10,000 remote villages in 23 African countries with digital TV access. With over 9,600 villages having received satellite infrastructure, the project is now nearing completion. The ambitious pledge, revealed during a period of warm China-Africa relations and funded by China’s aid budget, was entrusted to StarTimes, a private Chinese company already operating in several African countries. It was an apparent show of goodwill and an opportunity for China to flex its soft power in a strategically important region.  As China's economy struggles and Beijing re-calibrates its Africa strategy, the BBC World Service visited four villages in Kenya to find out if this ""soft power"" initiative had paid off. In the village of Olasiti, about three hours’ drive west of the capital, Nairobi, Nicholas Nguku gathered his friends and family to watch Kenyan athletes running at the Paris Olympics on television. “I’m very happy to see the Olympics, which for many years we had not been able to see before we got StarTimes,” he said, speaking of the company’s installation of satellite dishes about four years ago. He is far from the only beneficiary of StarTimes’ presence across Africa. First introduced to the continent in 2008, StarTimes is now one of the largest private digital TV providers in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 16 million subscribers. Analysts say that low pricing initially helped to secure its foothold.  In Kenya, monthly digital TV packages range from 329 shillings ($2.50; £2) to 1,799 shillings ($14; £10.50).  In comparison, a monthly package for DStv, owned by MultiChoice, another major player in the African digital TV market, costs between 700 and 10,500 shillings. While StarTimes partly relies on subscriptions for its core revenue, the “10,000 Villages Project” is funded by China's state–run South-South Assistance Fund. The satellite dishes all feature the StarTimes logo, Kenya’s Ministry of Information emblem, and a red “China Aid” logo. During the installation of these dishes, StarTimes representatives said that this was a ""gift"" from China, several villagers recalled. According to Dr Angela Lewis, an academic who has written extensively on StarTimes in Africa, the project had the potential to leave a positive image of China for African audiences. Villagers under the project ostensibly received everything for free, including the infrastructure, such as a satellite dish, battery, and installation, as well as a subscription to StarTimes’ content. This was a “game-changer,” according to Dr Lewis, as remote villages in Africa previously mostly had access to choppy and unreliable analogue TV. For many, this was their first access to satellite dishes, altering the way villagers interacted with the outside world, she said. For community centres like hospitals and schools in Ainomoi village in western Kenya, subscriptions remain free. At the local clinic a digital TV in the waiting room helps patients pass the time. And at a primary school, pupils enjoy watching cartoons after school. “After we finish schoolwork, we’ll all watch cartoons together and it’s a very enjoyable and bonding experience,” said Ruth Chelang’at, an eighth-grade student at the school. However, several Kenyan households interviewed by the BBC say the free trial unexpectedly lasted only a limited amount of time.  Despite its relatively cheap price, extending subscriptions was considered a significant financial burden for many. With that, the initial excitement has waned among some of the project’s beneficiaries, putting a dent in China’s push to build up goodwill. “We were all very happy when we first got the satellite dish, but it was only free for a few months, and after that we had to pay,” said Rose Chepkemoi, from Chemori village in Kericho county. “It was too much so we stopped using it.” Without a subscription, only certain free-to-air channels, such as the Kenyan Broadcasting Cooperation, are available, according to those who no longer subscribe to StarTimes packages. During the BBC’s visit to four different villages that received StarTimes dishes from 2018 to 2020, many villagers reported stopping their use of StarTimes after the free trial ended. The chief of Ainamoi village said that many of the original 25 households who received the satellite dishes in his village opted not to subscribe. The BBC contacted StarTimes for comment on the free trials but did not receive a reply. China’s influence extends to the content broadcast on StarTimes channels, with mixed results. Even the cheapest packages include channels like Kung Fu and Sino Drama, showcasing predominantly Chinese movies and series. In 2023, over 1,000 Chinese movies and TV shows were dubbed into local languages, Ma Shaoyong, StarTimes’ head of public relations, told local media. In Kenya’s case, in 2014, the company launched a channel called ST Swahili, dedicated to Swahili content. Among villagers who have watched Chinese shows, many said they found the programming outdated, portraying Chinese characters in a one-dimensional way, with shows often centred around stereotypical themes. A quick flick through the guide shows a plethora of dating or romance-centric shows, including a popular reality show called Hello, Mr. Right, where contestants seek to find their perfect match. The format was modelled on a similar show in China called If You Are the One. For some at least, that content is a reason to continue the subscription. Ariana Nation Ngotiek, a 21-year-old from Olasiti village, is “obsessed” with certain shows, like the Chinese series Eternal Love, which is dubbed into English. “I won’t go to sleep without watching it,” she said. But football remains the ultimate attraction for African audiences. In 2023, for example, the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) had a record number of nearly two billion viewers globally, according to the Confederation of African Football. Aware of this business opportunity, StarTimes has heavily invested in securing broadcasting rights for football matches, including Afcon, Spain's La Liga and Germany's Bundesliga. “Sports broadcasting is where StarTimes made its name,” explained Dr Lewis. Competition is fierce, however, and SuperSport, a subsidiary of MultiChoice, reportedly pays over $200m (£152m) annually for rights to broadcast the coveted English Premier League. After French football megastar Kylian Mbappé announced he was joining Spain's Real Madrid, StarTimes seized the opportunity and erected huge billboards in Nairobi that read “Feel the full thrill of La Liga”, followed by the StarTimes logo. However, this does not work for everyone. One football fan told the BBC he would “rather enjoy the thrill of Premier League.” “The majority of Kenyans are not into La Liga, it's the English Premier League that draws the audience,” explained Levi Obonyo, a professor at Nairobi’s Daystar University. While China’s international-facing state broadcaster CGTN, is included in its cheapest package, unlike the BBC and CNN, it does not draw in the viewers. “Yes, we also have Chinese news, but I don’t watch it,” said Lily Ruto, a retired teacher in Kericho county. “What’s it called again? C something N? T something N?” she laughed as she shrugged her shoulders. Dr Dani Madrid-Morales, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield, echoes that StarTimes has not revolutionised the [African] news environment. Most villagers say they prefer local news channels. StarTimes understands that. In fact, with over 95% of its 5,000-strong African staff being local, according to a company spokesperson, it aims to present itself as prioritising African voices. One consultant to Chinese media companies in Africa said that StarTimes was trying to avoid a repeat of what has happened to the likes of TikTok or Huawei, whose overt Chinese-ness have attracted a high level of scrutiny in the West. Dr Lewis’ study of news stories from 2015 to 2019 reinforces this, noting that most news stories mentioning StarTimes did not reference China or China-Africa relations. The company appears careful not to overtly showcase its Chinese roots. StarTimes as a private company has seen substantial success over the years, and the ""10,000 Villages Project"" has pushed the company to a new level of fame. However, as Beijing hosts yet another FOCAC, the image-building effect of the project that China had hoped for has failed to materialise. ""There was an attempt for the government to rebalance the information flow that would put China under a positive light, but that has not materialised,"" said Dr Madrid-Morales. ""The amount of money that has gone into this hasn’t really benefitted the Chinese government all that much."" Many villagers the BBC spoke to were mostly concerned about content and costs. As rusty as several of the satellite dishes themselves, the project, once the talk of the town, has seemingly been relegated to a footnote in China's soft-power outreach. “Yes, we know it comes from China, but it makes no difference if no-one is using it,” said Ms Chepkemoi, who has cancelled her StarTimes subscription.",2024-09-03 23:11:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qk9p2elo,Unknown,Unknown,,True
1993,Runner in 2012 'dirtiest race' gets 10-year ban,"Tatyana Tomashova finished the 1500m at London 2012 fourth When British athlete Lisa Dobriskey finished 10th in the women's 1500m final at London 2012, she did not hold back. ""I don't believe I'm competing on a level playing field,"" she told the BBC at the time. The race has been described as the dirtiest in history, with six of the first nine finishers falling foul of anti-doping regulations, the latest being Tatyana Tomashova. The Russian middle-distance runner, now 49, was on Tuesday stripped of the silver medal she won in that event, as well as being banned from the sport for 10 years. She was sanctioned after testing positive in 2021 for anabolic steroids in re-tests of her out-of-competition samples from June 21, 2012 and July 17, 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said. Dobriskey's British team-mate Laura Weightman finished 11th in the race 12 years ago but that has risen to sixth as a result of others having their results removed. ""11th to 6th in the years since the London 2012 final. Hard to comprehend,"" Weightman said on Instagram following the news of Tomashova's ban. ""I'll always be proud of my career and showing what is possible running clean."" Two-time world champion Tomashova, who had also received a doping ban in 2008, originally finished fourth in the 1500m final but that was upgraded after Turkish runners Asli Cakir Alptekin and Gamze Bulut lost their medals for doping. Bahrain's Maryam Yusuf Jamal won the gold medal, despite crossing the line third behind Cakir Alptekin and Bulut. Tomashova's punishment means Dobriskey will now be elevated to a fifth-place finish in the race. In a 2016 interview,, external she recalled how difficult it had been to see Cakir Alptekin celebrate her victory at the time. ""I stood there and saw her embark on a lap of honour and knew she'd cheated,"" she said. ""We were down to watch the last day but that included the 1500m medal ceremony and I didn't want to be there. I couldn't be there when that was happening."" Ethiopian-born Swede Abeba Aregawi, who also had an anti-doping violation in 2016 but escaped a ban, only received her reallocated bronze medal in a special ceremony at the Paris Olympics last month. That medal will now be upgraded to silver.",2024-09-03 23:11:38,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cewlqxkn5x8o,Unknown,2024-09-03 23:11:38,,True
1998,ParalympicsGB win 30th gold on day six in Paris,"Britain's swimming team now have 14 golds in Paris and 20 medals overall Faye Rogers edged team-mate Callie-Ann Warrington to deliver Great Britain's 30th gold medal on day six at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games. Rogers, 21, overhauled Warrington to touch the wall first in the women's S10 100m butterfly final as both swimmers claimed their first Paralympic medals. GB won six medals in total on Tuesday, with wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn winning her second silver of the Games in the women's T54 1500m and wheelchair fencer Piers Gilliver taking silver in the men's sabre A category. Natasha Baker and Georgia Wilson added bronzes in the individual grade III and II Para-equestrian events at the Chateau de Versailles. Elsewhere, British tennis stars Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid progressed to the men's wheelchair doubles semi-finals, while Para-table tennis player Will Bayley reached the last four of men's MS7 singles. Great Britain's men beat Australia in the quarter-finals of the wheelchair basketball to set up a semi-final against Germany. Briton Zac Shaw, who contested the men's T12 100m final on Saturday, was upgraded to a bronze medal after Turkey's winner Serkan Yildirim was retrospectively disqualified. GB are up to 61 medals, including their 30 golds - second only to China (115 medals, including 53 golds), the table-toppers at the past five Paralympic Games. Faye Rogers (right) says the nerve damage caused by her car accident makes it difficult for her to hold a pen and type Three years have passed since Rogers competed at the Olympic trials for the Tokyo Games. Unable to qualify, that September, she was injured in a car accident which left her with permanent damage to her right arm and, at the age of 19, she was initially told she would not be able to compete again. But, having won world Para-swimming gold last year, Rogers was crowned Paralympic champion in Paris. ""It's exactly three years as of now since my accident, so it's a bit emotional,"" Rogers said after clocking one minute 05.84 seconds to pip Warrington. ""It's a big full circle moment and I couldn't be prouder of how far I've come. I couldn't have asked for more from the last three years."" Warrington was equally delighted with her silver after producing a personal best 1:06.41 to finish close behind her good friend Rogers. ""To be able to race against Faye is just everything. We have been saying to each other the last couple of months, 'come on, we can get the one-two'. ""It was lovely to have her next to me. We are very good friends until we get to the blocks, then we are competitors, and it's nice to be able to separate that."" Sammi Kinghorn has doubled her Paralympic medal tally following silver and bronze in Tokyo GB's Kinghorn will target a Paris 2024 treble on Wednesday after winning her second silver at the Stade de France. The 28-year-old finished second in the women's T54 1500m behind Catherine Debrunner on Tuesday - two days after finishing runner-up to the Swiss athlete in the T53 800m event. On both occasions Debrunner set a Paralympic record to deny Kinghorn gold, and the Briton will once again come up against the triple Paralympic champion - chasing a fourth title in Paris - in the T53 100m final. Kinghorn, who has presented Countryfile, said she stopped momentarily with 200m to go because she thought the race was over, but still powered home in a time of three minutes 16.01 seconds. ""Who would have thought a sprinter would get a medal over 1500m, I certainly did not,"" Kinghorn said. ""I got a bit disorientated and stopped at 200m to go because I thought we were done - it’s so loud in here which we’re not used to. That noise is absolutely electric and I’m absolutely buzzing to come away with a medal."" Piers Gilliver will also contest the men's epee category A, men's foil team and men's epee team events in Paris Gilliver became Britain's first wheelchair fencing champion for 33 years by winning the men's epee category A event in Tokyo - a title he will aim to retain on Friday after winning Sabre silver in Paris. Now a five-time Paralympic medallist, the British 29-year-old beat Italy's Matteo Dei Rossi 15-8 in the quarter-finals before setting up a shot at gold with a narrow 15-14 win over Ukraine's Artem Manko at the Grand Palais. But, having led 8-7, Gilliver lost out 15-8 to Germany's Maurice Schmidt in the gold medal bout. ""I'm pretty gutted. I hoped to win the gold but it didn't work out on the day,"" said Gilliver, world silver medallist and European champion in the event. ""The competition days are always really tough and it's hard to process. Once the Games come to a close, you can look back and be proud of winning a medal."" Natasha Baker has won six Paralympic gold medals since 2012 Baker took her impressive tally of Paralympic medals to nine in the individual grade III event at Chateau de Versailles. The 34-year-old, who has now won medals at the past four games, returned to action after the birth of her son Joshua in April 2023. ""I'm not as fit as I was in Tokyo, I'm juggling being the best mum I can be and the best athlete I can be,"" said Baker, who scored 73.167 on Dawn Chorus. ""The juggle is real, you know on your computer when you have a million tabs open, that's my brain at all times, anyone who is a mum will understand."" Her success was mirrored by Wilson in the grade II competition, with the Tokyo medallist coming in third with a score of 73.414. There are 63 gold medals to be won on day seven at the Paris 2024 Paralympics - you can follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app from 12:30 BST, along with reports on all the action.

2018,Storey wins 18th Paralympic gold on 'appalling' course,"This video can not be played Paralympics 2024: Great Britain's Sarah Storey wins 18th gold medal Britain's Sarah Storey described the Paris Paralympics cycling time trial course as ""appalling"" after winning her 18th Games gold medal. Storey won the women's road event for a fifth successive Paralympics on a C5 event course measuring just 14.1km - the first time she has raced a Games course shorter than 22km. She was one of 13 British riders competing on Wednesday in road time trials, and there were three further medal achievements for ParalympicsGB women. Fran Brown - who subsequently revealed, external she dislocated a shoulder when knocked off her bicycle three days previously - won silver in the women's C1-3 category in the morning. In the afternoon, Sophie Unwin finished second in the women's B with pilot Jenny Holl - ahead of Lora Fachie and guide Corrine Hall who took bronze. Storey got the better of French hope Heidi Gaugain and then said athletes had appealed to Games organisers about the length of the women's race but heard nothing back. ""It's a short race. This is the shortest Paralympic time trial we have ever had, and I think it's a real shame because we don't get to showcase Para-sport in the way we want to,"" Storey said. ""You'll have to ask organisers. There's plenty of time in the day for us to do two laps like the men. Having fought so hard for parity in women's cycling, to not have it is a real disappointment. ""I've had to put that aside and focus on what I could control, because I couldn't control the race distance. But I hope they never do this to the women again, because it has been appalling. ""It's a hilly 10km. I do lots of those at home so I have plenty of practice. But in championships you expect a race of minimum 22km, that's what we've done in all the other Paralympic Games. ""Look back to that incredible course in Beijing, Brands Hatch with all the fans, Rio was flat but longer, Tokyo we had the motor circuit... three laps, it was a real challenge. ""This has been the most disappointing in that sense, given what came before it."" What's happening and when at the Paris Paralympics? Paris 2024 Paralympics medal table All you need to know about the Paris Paralympics Only one women's road time trial - the B event for visually impaired athletes - was contested over the two-lap distance of 28.3km, compared to seven men's events. The other six women's time trials were just one lap of the 14.1km course, as were five men's races. When asked if riders had spoken to Paris 2024 organisers, Storey said: ""We did ask the question, absolutely. You can ask, you might not hear anything back."" Asked if the competitors had heard anything, she said they had not. The 46-year-old from Poynton, Cheshire, had trailed Gaugain by more than seven seconds after 5.8km, but she stormed back in the final section to retain the title and win her 13th cycling gold to add to the five she won as a swimmer before switching sports prior to Beijing 2008. Team-mate Brown also expressed disappointment with the length of the course, although she also had some praise. ""I enjoyed it. It was different,"" Brown said. ""I would have liked a bit of a longer course as well, we are capable of riding a bit further, but we all did the same course on the day so make the most of it."" Sarah Storey won her 13th Paralympic gold in cycling, and her 18th in total Storey, who is competing solely in road events at Paris 2024, is taking part in her ninth Games - the most ever for a British athlete. She will look to add a 19th gold in the road race on Friday. Among active Paralympians, Belarusian swimmer Ihar Boki has overtaken Storey in terms of most gold medals won in a career, reaching 21 after his five victories in Paris. Storey won Wednesday's time trial in 20 minutes 22.15 seconds, putting her 4.69 seconds ahead of silver medallist Gaugain - 27 years her junior. Alana Forster of Australia won bronze. In spite of her feelings towards the course, Storey was delighted to extend her record as Britain's most decorated Paralympian with her 29th medal. She first competed in the Games at Barcelona in 1992. Storey was particularly pleased to win gold while her two children - 11-year-old Louisa and six-year-old Charlie - watched on. ""Louisa said to me last night at dinner, 'This is the first Games I’m going to remember',"" Storey said. ""I'm utterly delighted. I had a target to get five gold medals [in time trial]. I feel so, so proud. ""You can put the challenges aside, we race the course and prepare for it, but it is brilliant, to have friends and family here, the cheering off the start line. I'm so pleased.""

""Nothing quite like being knocked off your bike and dislocating your shoulder three days before the most important race of your life to enhance the preparation,"" she wrote. ""I had zero more to give today but thanks to the whole British Cycling team who made it possible to race my heart out. ""Once I’ve got over the sleep deprivation I’m sure it’ll feel even more amazing but for now it feels like some crazy dream to get a medal of any kind."" She is the second British cyclist to medal at these Games days after being injured while riding, after Jaco van Gass revealed he was hit by a car and knocked from his bike in Paris shortly before winning track gold. On a packed day for the British cycling team, Matthew Robertson came fifth in the men's C2 event, while Daphne Schrager finished fifth behind Brown in the women's C1-3. A day that started with medals for GB ended well too, as Unwin and Fachie both got on the podium - albeit having finished more than a minute behind Ireland's Katie-George Dunlevy who dominated on her way to gold. Fachie, who celebrated her 36th birthday on Wednesday as well as her sixth Paralympic medal, added to the bronze she won on the track in Paris in the individual pursuit. She said: ""It's great to get a second medal of the Games, we left it all out there."" Pilot Hall added: ""It's definitely been a good day for the women of the team, so bring on the road races in a couple of days."" There was disappointment for Tokyo Paralympic champion Benjamin Watson in the men's C3 as he could only come fourth in Paris, finishing 54.1 seconds behind the gold medallist, France's Thomas Peyroton-Dartet. Watson finished ahead of team-mates Fin Graham in sixth and van Gass, who took eighth. ""I couldn't go any harder, but I'm gutted,"" Watson said. ""I went out hard, then parked a bit in the second lap, while the French guy [Peyroton-Dartet] just accelerated."" Two-time Rio 2016 gold medallist Stephen Bate, who won silver on the track earlier in these Games, came fifth in the men's B time trial, as the 47-year-old competes in what may be his final Paralympics.

2012,Raygun apologises to Australian breakdancing community,"Australian Olympian Rachael Gunn has apologised to the nation’s breakdancing community for the “backlash” they have experienced following her controversial routine in Paris, which made headlines globally. Gunn, who competes as Raygun, was eliminated from the B-Girls competition with a score of zero, prompting ridicule and praise for her unorthodox style by users across social media. In her first sit-down interview since taking part in the Games - and amid questions over her qualification and performance - Gunn was asked if she genuinely thought she was Australia’s best female breakdancer. “I think my record speaks to that,” she told Network 10's The Project. “It is really sad to hear those criticisms and I am very sorry for the backlash that the community has experienced, but I can’t control how people react,” she continued, addressing the flood of critiques her routine has garnered online. The 36-year-old university lecturer lost all three of her Olympic battles, with her green tracksuit and eccentric performance – which included the sprinkler move and kangaroo-inspired hopping – generating a sea of memes. In the aftermath of her performance, Gunn faced accusations that she had manipulated the selection process, including allegations that she had set up her own governing body and that her husband had judged her qualification trial. These claims have since been denounced as false by several organisations, including the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) and the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF). ""The conspiracy theories were just awful,"" Gunn told Network 10. ""I was the top-ranked Australian B-girl in 2020 and 2022 and 2023. I have been invited to represent at how many World Championships... So, the record is there. But anything can happen in a battle,"" she added. Gunn, who has a background as a jazz, tap and ballroom dancer, had publicly defended her routine as “artistic and creative”. “I was never going to beat these girls on what they do best, the dynamic and the power moves, so I wanted to move differently,” she said last month. The top judge who oversaw the B-Girls competition has also thrown his weight behind Gunn, as have team officials and the broader Olympic breakdancing community. But the fallout has divided and disappointed those involved in the sport in Australia. “It made a mockery of the Australian scene and I think that's why a lot of us are hurting,” Australian hip-hop pioneer Spice previously told the BBC. A hip-hop inspired dance born in the boroughs of New York in the 1970s, breaking was introduced into this year's Olympic schedule to attract a younger audience to the Games. But some critics say it should never have been included, due to the organic nature of the genre, which doesn't necessarily suit organised competition. After her performance in Paris, Gunn appealed to the media directly in a video posted on her Instagram to stop “harassing” her family and friends. In her interview with Network 10, she described being chased by reporters in the aftermath of the fallout as “really wild”. “That really did put me in a state of panic... Dancing was my medicine, and then it turned into my source of stress,"" she said. Gunn admitted that she is ""not in a place yet"" to watch her performance back, but was touched by the support she has received from her fellow Olympians at the Closing Ceremony as well as from some of the general public. ""It so warmed my heart,"" she said. ""I would rather much focus on the positives out of this and the joy that I've brought people.""",2024-09-04 23:11:04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg54k40857o,Unknown,Unknown,,True
2008,US accuses Russia of 2024 election interference,"The US has charged and sanctioned Russian state media executives and restricted Kremlin-linked broadcasters as it accused Moscow of a widespread campaign to interfere with the presidential election. The justice, state and treasury departments announced coordinated actions on Wednesday to ""aggressively counter"" the alleged operations. Attorney General Merrick Garland accused state broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today, of paying a Tennessee firm $10m to ""create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging"". RT boss Margarita Simonyan was one of 10 people sanctioned for alleged attempts to harm ""public trust in our institutions"". RT denied involvement.  Mr Garland said that Moscow wanted to secure a ""preferred outcome"" in the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that Russia's programme was aimed at ""reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters here in the US"". A Treasury official meanwhile said that RT and other Russian state media had engaged in a ""nefarious campaign to covertly recruit unwittingly American influencers in support of their malign activity"". The Biden administration's response so far includes: Much of the Kremlin's disinformation effort is directed and funded by RT, Mr Kirby said. ""RT is no longer just a propaganda arm of the Kremlin,"" he said. ""It's being used to advance covert Russian influence actions."" The state media outlet mocked the US government's accusations, saying in a statement to the BBC that ""2016 called and it wants its clichés back"". ""Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and RT's interference in the US elections."" The criminal indictments of Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva do not identify by name the Tennessee-based content creation company they used. But the court filing's description of ""a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues"" matches the self-description carried on the website of an outlet named Tenet Media. Tenet posts thousands of English-language videos on social media, and promotes well-known right-wing commentators Benny Johnson, Tim Pool and Dave Rubin as its ""talent"". The company has been contacted for comment. US officials warn that a growing number of foreign adversaries have attempted to interfere with its elections since Russia's efforts in 2016. In June, a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government successfully breached Donald Trump's campaign and leaked internal documents. A month later, the Department of Justice announced the seizure of two domain names and the search of nearly 1,000 social media accounts operated by Russian actors to ""create an AI-enhanced social media bot farm that spread disinformation"". Researchers have also uncovered a growing Chinese influence operation aimed at infiltrating and swaying US political conversations on social media. Xi Jinping, China's president, pledged his country would not interfere in the US election during a summit with President Joe Biden last November. Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said on Tuesday that the US could ""absolutely expect... foreign adversaries"" to try to ""undermine American confidence in our democracy... and sow partisan discord"".  ""And that's why it is up to all of us not to let our foreign adversaries be successful."" Eight years ago, Russia conducted a sophisticated campaign that involved hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking stolen documents to Wikileaks with the intent of hurting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Many Democrats argue the operation helped contribute to Trump's eventual victory that November. US politicians and intelligence officials have since concluded that the operation was directly ordered by Vladimir Putin, Russia's president. Twelve Russian military intelligence officers were charged in 2018 with orchestrating the effort, and federal warrants were issued for their arrest.",2024-09-04 23:11:04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rx28v1vpro,Unknown,Unknown,,True
2007,Trump Media shares erase 2024 gains,"Donald Trump's media company was hit by a fresh round of selling on Wednesday, wiping out gains the share price had enjoyed this year alongside the rising political fortunes of its namesake. Shares fell more than 6% to less than $17, which is less than what they were worth at the start of 2024.  The share price, which hit a peak in April during the former president's criminal trial, has fallen more than 70% from its high.  The firm, operator of the social media platform Truth Social, still boasts a market value of more than $3.3bn - a hefty sum for a small company with shrinking revenue and growing losses.  Mr Trump's victory in the January Republican primary had helped to stoke interest in the Trump Media at the start of the year. Buyers snapped up shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp., a publicly-traded shell company, which was created to buy Trump Media and was seen on Wall Street as a proxy for the firm.  Demand jumped farther around the time the merger was formally completed in March. The price has swung wildly in the months since.  Its most recent high came in July, after Trump survived an assassination attempt and before President Joe Biden bowed out of the race, but the price has slid lower in recent weeks.  The falls come as the company approaches the date at which Trump and other early investors will be free to start selling their shares. Mr Trump's stake is currently worth about $2bn, down from more than $6bn a few months ago.  Analysts had warned investors to expect big swings in value, describing it as a ""meme stock"", propelled by sentiment rather than its financial characteristics.",2024-09-04 23:11:04,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93p2v72dpdo,Unknown,Unknown,,True

A team of 215 athletes will represent ParalympicsGB in the French capital with a target of 100-140 medals set by UK Sport.  At the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games, held in 2021, the GB team finished second behind China in the medal table with 124 medals, including 41 golds. The Games began with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, 28 August, with the first medals decided the following day and action continuing until the closing ceremony on Sunday, 8 September.  Medal events: 63 Para-athletics (women’s F35 shot put, T38 long jump, F57 shot put, T37 100m, F64 shot put, T63 long jump, T12 100m, T53 400m, T54 400m, F33 shot put; men’s T12 400m, T13 400m, F11 discus, F64 discus, T11 100m, T53 800m, F35 shot put, T54 800m, F13 javelin); Shooting Para-sport (R6 - mixed 50m rifle prone SH1); Para-swimming (women’s SB7 100m breaststroke, S10 400m freestyle, SB11 100m breaststroke, SM9 200m IM, SB13 100m breaststroke, SB12 100m breaststroke, S8 50m freestyle; men’s S5 50m freestyle, S6 100m freestyle, SB11 100m breaststroke, SM9 200m IM, SB13 100m breaststroke; mixed 4x50m medley – 20 point), Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 50kg, up to 55kg; men’s up to 59kg, up to 65kg); Boccia (mixed BC1/2 team, mixed BC3 pairs, mixed BC4 pairs); Wheelchair tennis (women’s doubles; quad singles); Para-table tennis (men’s MS2 singles, MS3 singles, MS11 singles; women’s WS7 singles, WS11 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s foil team; men’s foil team); Para-cycling road (men’s H1-2 road race, H3 road race, H4 road race, H5 road race; women’s H1-4 road race, H5 road race); Goalball (women’s final, men’s final), Para-archery (mixed team recurve open); Para-judo (women -48kg J1, -48kg J2, -57kg J1; men -60 kg J1, -60 kg J2) GB will be hoping for success at different ends of the experience scale on day eight in Paris. Discus thrower Dan Greaves will be hoping to win his seventh medal at his seventh Games in the F64 event (18:04), having made his debut in Sydney in 2000 aged 18 and winning a gold, two silvers and three bronzes over his career. Team-mate Harrison Walsh will also be challenging for a medal. And in the pool, 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith, the youngest member of the GB team, has a strong chance of a medal in the SB7 100m breaststroke (16:30) at her first Games. It could be a good day for the GB throwers. Along with Greaves and Walsh, Dan Pembroke defends his F13 javelin title (19:45) having won two world titles since his gold in Tokyo in 2021 while Funmi Oduwaiye will hope to challenge in the F64 women’s shot put (10:43). A throw around her season’s best of 11.82m could put the former basketball player in the medal mix and Anna Nicholson will be hoping for a first major medal in the F35 shot put (09:00), having smashed her PB earlier this summer. Also in the field, Olivia Breen in the T38 long jump (09:04) and Sammi Kinghorn in the T53 400m (18:25) on the track will be aiming to add to their Paralympic medals. Pembroke was an Olympic hopeful but a degenerative eye condition saw him step away from the sport for a time Shooter Matt Skelhon won Paralympic gold on his debut in Beijing in 2008 and goes into the R6 mixed 50m rifle prone SH1 event as reigning world and European champion and will be aiming to hold all three titles at once (qualifying 08:30, final 10:45). In the pool, Becky Redfern will be cheered on by four-year-old son Patrick as she hopes to make it third time lucky in the SB13 100m breaststroke (18:22) after silvers in Rio and Tokyo. Powerlifters Olivia Broome and Mark Swan will be hoping for medals in the women’s -50kg (11:00) and men’s -65kg (17:35) events while the boccia team finals take place with GB hoping to figure in the BC1/2 team (16:00) and the BC3 mixed pairs (20:00) and the men’s basketball semi-finals will ensure plenty of excitement (15:00 and 20:30). Sprinter Timothee Adolphe is one of the big home hopes for success at the Stade de France and he will be aiming to shine in the T11 100m final (18:08) for athletes with little or no vision. As well as his athletics career, Adolphe is also a talented hip hop artist and was signed up by fashion house Louis Vuitton for a Games advertising campaign where he joined Olympic swimming star Leon Marchand. In the pool, Germany’s Elena Semechin and American Ali Truwit will both be hoping to claim medals after challenging times. Semechin won gold at Tokyo 2020 under her maiden name of Krawzow but months later was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Now back to full fitness, she goes in the SB12 100m breaststroke (18:29). Truwit could be a big challenger in the 400m S10 freestyle final (16:50) just over a year after losing her leg below the knee in a shark attack in the Caribbean. Boccia is one of two Paralympic sports – along with goalball – which does not have an Olympic counterpart. Similar to petanque, it is played by athletes in wheelchairs who have an impairment that affects their motor function.  The name comes from the Italian word for ‘ball’ and the sport made its Paralympic debut in 1984 and is played by athletes from more than 70 countries.

Jeanette Chippington, the oldest member of the ParalympicsGB team in Paris aged 54, is among the GB Para-canoeists getting their campaigns under way – she goes in the heats of the VL2 (09:20) before the preliminaries of the KL1 (10:25). GB will hope to continue their dominance in the Para-equestrian team test (from 08:30) having won every gold since it was introduced into the Games in 1996. It could also be a big day in the wheelchair fencing at the Grand Palais with Piers Gilliver aiming to retain his epee A crown (19:50) and both Dimitri Coutya in the epee B (18:40) and Gemma Collis in the women’s epee A (20:25) also in good form.  Hewett is playing at his third Paralympics Alfie Hewett has won everything in wheelchair tennis, apart from a Paralympic gold medal, and he and Gordon Reid will hope to figure in the men’s doubles decider (from 12:30) after winning silver in both Rio and Tokyo. Table tennis player Will Bayley will hope to be involved in the MS7 singles final (18:15) and win again after Rio gold and Tokyo silver while Rio champion Rob Davies and Tokyo bronze medallist Tom Matthews could figure in the MS1 singles decider (13:00). Poppy Maskill will be aiming for gold in the pool in the S14 100m backstroke (18:08). Bethany Firth won three golds in the event – one for Ireland in 2012 before switching nationalities and triumphing for GB in Rio and Tokyo but she will not be in Paris having recently given birth. US sprinter Hunter Woodhall watched on proudly in Paris in August as his wife Tara Davis-Woodhall won Olympic long jump gold and he will hope to match her achievement in the T62 400m (18:33) His Paralympic plans were hampered by a bout of Covid after the Olympics but Woodhall, who claimed bronze in the event in Tokyo, will be hoping to be fully fit. Dutch wheelchair tennis star Diede de Groot will be favourite to retain her women’s singles title at Roland Garros (from 12:30) after a 2024 which has already yielded Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles. And in the pool, Italy’s Simone Barlaam will be hoping for another successful night in the S9 100m butterfly (17:34) with Ireland’s Barry McClements bidding to figure. Para-equestrian teams are made up three athletes, at least one of which must be a Grade I, II or III and no more than two athletes within a team may be the same grade. Each combination rides the set test for their grade, which is scored as per the individual test – no scores are carried over from the previous test. The scores of all three team members are combined to produce a team total, and the nation with the highest total takes gold. In Grade I to III, athletes ride in smaller dressage arenas compared with Grade IV to V, and the difficulty of tests increases with the grade. Grade I athletes perform tests at a walk, while Grades II and III can walk and trot. In Grades IV and V, they perform tests at a walk, trot, cantor and do lateral work. Medal events: 75 Para-athletics (men’s T13 long jump, F34 shot put, T34 800m, T35 200m, T37 200m, T36 100m, F41 javelin, F33 shot put, T20 long jump, T38 1500m, T64 200m, F63 shot put, T47 400m; women’s F54 javelin, T13 400m, F40 shot put, T11 200m, T12 200m, T47 200m, T34 800m, T38 400m, T63 100m); Para-cycling road (women’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; men’s C1-3 road race, T1-2 road race; mixed H1-5 team relay); Para-canoe (men’s KL1, KL2, KL3; women’s VL2, VL3); Para-equestrian (Grade I freestyle test, Grade II freestyle test, Grade III freestyle test, Grade IV freestyle test, Grade V freestyle test); Para-judo (men’s -90kg J1, -90kg J2, +90kg J1, +90kg J2, women’s +70kg J1, +70kg J2); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 73kg, up to 79kg; men’s up to 88kg, up to 97kg); Wheelchair tennis (men’s singles); Para-swimming (men’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S12 100m butterfly, S3 200m freestyle; women’s SM10 200m IM, S6 100m backstroke, S8 100m butterfly, S7 50m butterfly, S4 50m backstroke, S11 100m freestyle, SM5 200m IM; mixed 34 point 4x100m freestyle relay); Para-table tennis (men’s MS4 singles, MS8 singles, MS9 singles; women’s WS4 singles, WS6 singles, WS8 singles, WS9 singles); Wheelchair fencing (women’s epee team, men’s epee team); Wheelchair basketball (men’s final), Blind football (final), Sitting volleyball (women’s final) The final day of the track athletics programme should see two of Britain’s most successful and high-profile athletes in action. Hannah Cockroft goes in as favourite for the T34 800m (19:20) – an event where she is two-time defending champion and unbeaten in the event at major championships since 2014. Shot putter Aled Sion Davies took bronze in the event at London 2012 but is unbeaten ever since and goes into the F63 final (19:25) as number one in the world while Zak Skinner will hope to make up for fourth in Tokyo with a medal in the T13 long jump (09:00). Tokyo gold medal-winning canoeist Emma Wiggs will be hoping to retain her VL2 title (10:52) while Charlotte Henshaw, who also won gold in Tokyo, and winter Paralympian Hope Gordon could be fighting it out in the VL3 event (11:36) – a new addition to the programme in Paris. Hannah Cockroft holds the world record in the T34 800m Britain’s three judoka will all be in action – Tokyo gold medallist Chris Skelley in the +90kg J2 division (final 17:13) after Dan Powell and Evan Molloy bid for glory in the -90kg J1 (14:32) and 90kg J2 (16:09) divisions. Ben Watson and Fin Graham could fight it out again in the men’s C1-3 road race (from 08:30) after winning gold and silver in Tokyo while Daphne Schrager and Fran Brown go in the women’s race. The Para-equestrian events conclude with the freestyle events (from 08:30) involving the top eight combinations in each grade from the individual tests earlier in the programme. The final night of the swimming could see butterfly success for both Alice Tai in the women’s S8 100m event (17:07) and for Stephen Clegg in the men’s S12 100m (18:23) – the latter was edged out for gold in Tokyo by 0.06 seconds. Alfie Hewett will be hoping to figure in the men’s singles medal matches in the wheelchair tennis at Roland Garros (from 12:30) while at the Bercy Arena, the men’s wheelchair basketball programme comes to a climax (20:30). American Ellie Marks was due to compete at the 2014 Invictus Games in London but instead a respiratory infection left her in a coma in Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. She recovered and after winning four golds at the Invictus Games in 2016 presented one of the gold medals to the hospital staff who saved her life. She made her Paralympic debut in Rio, winning breaststroke gold and in Tokyo claimed S6 backstroke gold and will aim to defend her title (16:53). Italy will hope for another Para-athletics clean sweep in the T63 100m (20:22) where Ambra Sabatini, Martina Caironi and Monica Contrafatto finished in the medal positions in Tokyo and again at the 2023 and 2024 Worlds. And at the Eiffel Tower Stadium, Brazil will be hoping to continue their dominance in the blind football tournament in the gold-medal match (19:00). Blind football teams are made up of four outfield players and one goalkeeper, who is sighted. Matches are divided into two 20-minute halves and played on a pitch measuring 40 metres x 20 metres with boards running down both sidelines to keep the ball, which has rattles built in so players can locate it, within the field of play. In attack, the footballers are aided by a guide who stands behind the opposition goal. Spectators are asked to stay silent during play and when players move towards an opponent, go in for a tackle or are searching for the ball, they say ""voy"" or a similar word. Medal events: 14 Para-athletics (men’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon; women’s T54 marathon, T12 marathon); Para-canoe (women’s KL1, KL2, KL3; men’s VL2, VL3); Para-powerlifting (women’s up to 86kg, over 86kg; men’s up to 107kg, over 107kg); Wheelchair basketball (women’s final) On the final day, action returns to the streets of the French capital with the marathons (from 07:00) which will include a 185-metre climb and link Seine-Saint-Denis, the area at the heart of the Games, and central Paris. As the race nears its end, the competitors will pass through Place de la Concorde, which hosted the opening ceremony, before heading up the Champs-Elysees and its cobbles to the Arc de Triomphe and the finish line at the Esplanade des Invalides, which was also the Olympic marathon finish. Eden Rainbow-Cooper made a major breakthrough when she won the Boston Marathon in April and will hope to shine on the Paris streets along with David Weir who famously won in London but was fifth in Tokyo after failing to finish in Rio. GB will be hoping for canoe success with defending KL2 champion Charlotte Henshaw and KL3 champion Laura Sugar both hoping to be on top of the podium again (10:41 and 11:07) and could model and Mr England winner Jack Eyers land a medal in the VL3 final (11:33)? Eyers chose to have his right leg amputated aged 16 and was the first amputee to be crowned Mr England The final day of powerlifting sees the heavyweights take to the stage – the women’s up to 86kg (09:35) and over 86kg divisions (13:00) and the men’s up to 107kg (08:00) and over 107kg (14:35) - the final gold medal before the closing ceremony. In the over 107kg division in Tokyo, Jordan’s Jamil Elshebli and Mansour Pourmirzaei of Iran both lifted 241kg – almost 38 stone in old money - with Elshebli winning gold on countback. China’s Deng Xuemei lifted 153kg to take the women’s over 86kg and you can expect plenty of big lifts again this time around. The women’s wheelchair basketball also takes centre stage with the Netherlands aiming to retain the title they won for the first time in Tokyo (final 12:45).",2024-09-04 23:11:05,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg4y131ge2ko,Elizabeth Hudson,2024-09-04 23:11:05,,True
2056,Storey extends record as GB win 13 medals on Wednesday,"Sarah Storey won her 18th Paralympic gold medal on Wednesday morning in the C5 women's time trial Great Britain's most decorated Paralympian Sarah Storey won her 18th career gold as ParalympicsGB secured 13 more medals on day seven at Paris 2024. Cyclist Storey, 46, won the women's C5 time trial to secure her 29th Paralympic medal - 32 years after her first in 1992. GB collected two further golds on Wednesday as wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn won the women's T53 100m final and Dimitri Coutya was victorious in the wheelchair fencing foil category B. ParalympicsGB also won seven silver medals on day seven and three bronzes. GB remain second in the medal table with Wednesday's results increasing their gold total to 33 and medal tally to 74. Only China have more medals than Great Britain with 135. This video can not be played Sarah Storey's 18th Paralympic gold medal comes 32 years after she won her first in Barcelona in 1992 ParalympicsGB's bountiful Wednesday was kicked off by the nation's most decorated Paralympian, Storey, who is competing at her ninth Games. Such is her longevity, Storey had already won 16 Paralympic medals before French teenager Heidi Gaugain - who finished second behind her on day seven - was even born. Wednesday's win means she now has 29 Paralympic medals in all - 16 in Para-swimming and 13 in Para-cycling. She is fifth on the all-time Paralympic medal list. There was also a Para-cycling silver for GB's Fran Brown, with the 39-year-old then posting on social media her medal came three days after she dislocated her shoulder having been knocked off her bike by a car. Sophie Unwin and Lora Fachie, with their pilots Jenny Holl and Corinne Hall, won silver and bronze respectively in the women’s B individual time trial behind Ireland’s Katie-George Dunlevy, who won her country’s first gold medal of the Games. Storey wins 18th Paralympic gold on 'appalling' course This video can not be played Kinghorn beats Debrunner to gold in T53 100m If at first you don't succeed, try and try again. Great Britain's Kinghorn must have been sick of the sight of Switzerland's Catherine Debrunner having finished second behind her in the T53 800m and 1500m earlier in the Games. Kinghorn came into the 100m final as a four-time Paralympic medal winner, but had never before won a gold. She needed something special in the 100m and she delivered, crossing the line with a Paralympic record time of 15.64 to beat the Swiss by 0.13 seconds. ""I sobbed the whole way round my victory lap, just sobbed the whole time,"" she said. Kinghorn and Debrunner will line up against each other again on Thursday over 400m. Kinghorn's 'mind blown' by first Paralympic gold Coutya’s first gold is an upgrade on the bronze he won in Tokyo British wheelchair fencer Coutya is another Paralympian who finally secured a long-awaited first gold medal on Wednesday. The world number one could only win bronze in Tokyo, but three years later managed to beat China's two-time defending Paralympic champion Feng Yanke 15-7 at the Grand Palais. ""I really wanted that gold,"" the European champion said after his victory. ""And it's something that I've dedicated my life to for the last few years."" Coutya, who is also world number one in epee category B, will target further gold medals in the men’s team foil quarter-final on Thursday (11:40 BST), the individual epee B category on Friday (08:40) and team epee quarter-final on Saturday (11:40). The 26-year-old is certainly one to watch. GB's Coutya wins Paralympic gold in wheelchair fencing Alice Tai won silver for Great Britain in the S8 women's 400m freestyle final Great Britain were swimming in silvers on Wednesday with three of their seven coming in the pool. Rhys Darbey and Poppy Maskill added to the golds they won in the S14 mixed 4x100m freestyle relay with successive silvers in the men's and women's S14 200m individual medley finals on Wednesday afternoon. About 30 minutes later, GB's Alice Tai finished second in the S8 women’s 400m freestyle final, behind USA's Jessica Long who claimed her 17th career Paralympic gold. And while success was flowing in the pool, ParalympicsGB also claimed silver medals through Zoe Newson in the Para-powerlifting women's -45kg event, and Andy Lapthorne and Greg Slade in the wheelchair tennis quad doubles. Elsewhere, Britain's Sophie Wells took bronze in the Para-equestrian grade V individual test, winning her ninth Paralympic medal, while Tim Jeffery won Para-shooting bronze in the mixed 50m rifle prone SH2. And the success keeps coming. Looking ahead, more podium places are on the way. British 14-year-old Bly Twomey is guaranteed a medal in the Para-table tennis women's WS7 singles after reaching the semi-finals on her debut.  Rob Davies will claim at least a silver after reaching the Para-table tennis men's singles MS1 final. He faces Cuba's Yunier Fernandez in the showpiece match on Friday (13:00 BST). Alfie Hewett is also through to the last four of the wheelchair tennis men's singles. He will also contest the men's doubles final alongside team-mate Gordon Reid on Friday.
