0,Israel examining Hamas response to ceasefire plan,"Israel says it is studying a response by Hamas to a Gaza ceasefire plan outlined by President Biden at the end of May. It comes after Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators Egypt and Qatar ""about the ideas"" it has been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until it eliminates Hamas. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC Hamas is no longer insisting on a full ceasefire at the outset of the three-phase plan. President Biden said the plan which he outlined was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal. The first phase would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve a ""permanent end to hostilities"" and the third phase a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and completion of return of dead hostages' remains. A joint statement from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Mossad intelligence agency on Wednesday night said the mediators had ""conveyed to the [Israeli] negotiating team Hamas's remarks on the outline of the hostages deal"". ""Israel is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,"" it added. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Thursday that Hamas has given up the condition of a complete ceasefire in exchange for new conditions related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's southern border area known as the Philadelphi corridor and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of Hamas’s response submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere is positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 37,953 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

1,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 10:49:19,Unknown
2,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

3,Kris Jenner shares plans for removal of her ovaries,"US reality TV star Kris Jenner has spoken emotionally about plans to have her ovaries removed. In scenes during reality show, The Kardashians, the US media personality and businesswoman revealed she was set to have the procedure after doctors found a cyst and a tumour. While on holiday in Aspen, Colorado with partner Corey Gamble, Jenner broke the news to her daughters, Kendall, Kim and Khloé Kardashian. ""I wanted to tell you guys something because I hadn’t told you yet, but I went to the doctor and I had my scan,"" she said. ""And this just makes me really emotional, but… they found a cyst and like a little tumour on my ovary."" ""So I went to the doctor, and Dr A said I have to have my ovaries taken out. And I'm just really emotional about it because they came in handy with you guys. ""It’s also a thing about getting older,"" she added. ""It’s a sign of 'we’re done with this part of your life.' It’s a whole chapter that’s just closed."" Jenner has six children. Kim, Khloé, Kourtney and Rob Kardashian, from her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian. She also has Kendall and Kylie Jenner, from her marriage to Caitlyn Jenner. Kris Jenner added that her biggest achievement was raising her family. ""People often ask me what is the best job you’ve ever had, and I always say mom,"" she said. ""The biggest blessing in my life was being able to give birth to six beautiful kids."" Speaking to the camera, Kim Kardashian empathised with why her mother was upset. ""To have a surgery and remove your ovaries is a really big deal,"" she said. ""I feel really sad for her. I couldn't even imagine being in that situation and how you would feel really scared to be going through that."" Kourtney also agreed, saying she ""would feel the same way"". ""It's like your womanly power,"" she added.  ""It doesn’t mean it’s taking away who she is or what she’s experienced, but I would feel this sentimental feeling of what it’s created."" Kendall added: ""I get that it's sad because they [her ovaries] have brought all her kids into the world, which is totally fair. ""But at the same time, what are we going to use those for anymore? If they're potentially hurting you, let's get them out of there.""",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydv4je6g11o,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-04 10:52:19,Unknown

5,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
6,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:39:19,Unknown
7,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:39:19,Unknown
8,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
9,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

20,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 01:39:20,Unknown
19,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

18,"Project 2025: The Trump presidency wish list, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  On Wednesday, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted pushback from the Biden campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have renewed attention on the Project 2025 document.  It is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency. But Democrats have taken aim at the Heritage paper, seeking to get campaign value out of some of its more drastic measures.  Last month, Congressman Jared Huffman of California announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. Mr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in an early June statement.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. Trump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-03 21:39:20,Unknown
17,Revered screenwriter Robert Towne dies aged 89,"Robert Towne, who wrote films including Chinatown and Mission: Impossible, has been remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters following his death at the age of 89. Towne won an Oscar for his 1974 crime and corruption thriller Chinatown, which starred Jack Nicholson as a private detective. He was nominated for four Oscars during his career in total, including for co-writing 1975's Shampoo with the film's star Warren Beatty. Lee Grant, who won best supporting actress for her role in that film, paid tribute to Towne on X. ""His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic & entirely originally [sic],"" she wrote. ""He gave me the gift of Shampoo. He gave all of us the gift of his words & his films. There isn’t another like him. There won’t be again."" Towne also had a high reputation as a script doctor, fixing or adding to existing scripts, such as 1967's Bonnie and Clyde and 1972's The Godfather. Towne often didn't get an official credit, but The Godfather's writer-director Francis Ford Coppola used his Oscars best adapted screenplay acceptance speech to thank him for writing a pivotal and ""very beautiful"" scene between Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's characters in a garden. ""That was Bob Towne's scene,"" Coppola told the 1973 award ceremony. Towne also earned his own Oscar nominations for writing 1973's The Last Detail - also starring Nicholson - and 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. However, he had handed over writing duties on Greystoke and disliked the results so much that he took his name off the credits and used the pseudonym PH Vazak instead. Vazak was the name of his Hungarian sheepdog. Towne had no such qualms about Chinatown, but did admit to having fierce rows with director Roman Polanski throughout the writing and filming process. ""We fought every day, over everything,"" he said. Scott Tobias wrote in the Guardian last month: ""There has been no greater original screenplay in the last 50 years than the one Robert Towne wrote for Chinatown. ""None more elegantly plotted and politically charged, none more literate and historically evocative, none more pungent in its hard-bitten dialogue and sophisticated in its play on noir archetypes."" In 2006, Chinatown was ranked third on a Writers Guild of America list of the greatest screenplays ever - ahead of The Godfather in second and Casablanca in first, meaning Towne had at least a hand in two of the top three. In 2017, Vulture placed him at number three on its list of the best screenwriters of all time. Following his death, the American Film Institute wrote on X: ""From writing masterpieces like Chinatown, Shampoo & countless others, his influence is everlasting."" Towne's Chinatown sequel, The Two Jakes, failed to make the same impact when it was released in 1990. He also wrote 1990 racing drama Days of Thunder and 1993 legal thriller The Firm, both of which starred Tom Cruise. And when Cruise launched the Mission: Impossible film franchise in 1996, Towne co-wrote the first instalment and had the sole writing credit on the second. He also served as both writer and director on a string of films, including 1982's athletics drama Personal Best. The New York Times reported that he had affairs with the film's stars Patrice Donnelly and Mariel Hemingway, leading to the end of his first marriage, to actress Julie Payne. Towne also wrote and directed 1988's Tequila Sunrise, starring Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer; and was credited as a ""consulting producer"" on the 2014-15 season of TV's Mad Men. Towne is survived by his second wife Luisa, and daughters Chiara and Katharine.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g3dy6jdlpo,"Ian Youngs,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
16,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 08:39:20,Unknown
12,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

14,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:53:20,Unknown
13,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngl45jz1zo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
11,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

10,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player.

15,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-03 23:39:20,Unknown

30,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

28,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

26,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

24,Jeff Bezos to sell another $5bn of Amazon shares,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he will sell another 25 million shares in the technology giant, worth nearly $5bn (£3.9bn). It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off.

23,World's oldest cave art found showing humans and pig,"The oldest example of figurative cave art has been discovered in the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi by Australian and Indonesian scientists. The painting of a wild pig and three human-like figures is at least 51,200 years old, more than 5,000 years older than the previous oldest cave art. The discovery pushes back the time that modern humans first showed the capacity for creative thought. Prof Maxime Aubert from Griffith University in Australia told BBC News that the discovery would change ideas about human evolution. “The painting tells a complex story. It is the oldest evidence we have for storytelling. It shows that humans at the time had the capacity to think in abstract terms,” he said. The painting shows a pig standing still with its mouth partly open and at least three human-like figures.  The largest human figure has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod. The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout. It also seems to be holding a stick, one end of which may be in contact with the pig’s throat. The last human-like figure seems to be upside-down with its legs facing up and splayed outwards. It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig’s head. The team of scientists was led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, an Indonesian rock art specialist from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) in Jakarta. He says that that narrative storytelling was a crucial part of early human culture in Indonesia from a very early point in time. “Humans have probably been telling stories for much longer than 51,200 years, but as words do not fossilise we can only go by indirect proxies like depictions of scenes in art – and the Sulawesi art is now the oldest such evidence by far that is known to archaeology,” he said. The first evidence for drawing were found on rocks in the Blombos Caves in southern Africa and dates back to between 75,000 to 100,000 years ago. These consist of geometric patterns.  The new painting, in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, shows representational art – an abstract representation of the world around the person or people that painted it.  It therefore represents an evolution in the thought processes in our species that gave rise to art and science. The question is what triggered this awakening of the human mind, according to Dr Henry Gee, who is a senior editor at the journal Nature, where the details were published. “Something seems to have happened around 50,000 years ago, shortly after which all other species of human such as Neanderthals and the so-called Hobbit died out.  “It is very romantic to think that at some point in that time something happened in the human brain, but I think it is more likely that there are even earlier examples of representational art”. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that there may be examples of ancient representational art in Africa, where modern humans first evolved, but we have not found any yet. “This find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread. “If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge. Obviously this oldest date is work on one panel at one site - hopefully more dating will be done at more sites to confirm this apparently crucial finding”. The new dating was made possible using a new method which involves cutting tiny amounts of the art using a laser. This enables researchers to study different parts of the artwork in greater detail and come up with a more accurate dating. As the new method becomes more widely used, several sites with cave art across the world may be re-dated, possibly pushing back further the emergence of representational art. Until 10 years ago, the only evidence of ancient cave art was found in places such as Spain and Southern France.  It led some to believe that the creative explosion that led to the art and science we know today began in Europe. But the discovery of coloured outlines of human hands in South Suluwesi in 2014 shattered that view Then in November 2018, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh  on the Indonesian Island of Borneo, scientists found the then oldest representational artwork, thought to  be more than 40,000 years old, of an unknown animal. Prof Adam Brumm from Griffith University said that the latest Indonesian cave art discoveries cast new light on the important role of storytelling in the history of art. “It is noteworthy that the oldest cave art we have found in Sulawesi thus far consists of recognisable scenes: that is, paintings that depict humans and animals interacting in such a way that we can infer the artist intended to communicate a narrative of some kind – a story,” he said.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewjq4dxwo,"Pallab Ghosh,",2024-07-03 14:39:21,Unknown
22,Australian Senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 06:39:21,Unknown
25,'Almost whole island homeless' in Hurricane Beryl's wake,"Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her. Virtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said. “Union Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,” said Ms Coy in a video message. “There are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.” Fisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed.  “Everything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,” he said. A resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level. “It’s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island – easily 90% – has been erased.” The extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice. “I was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we would make it out at all.” His cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town.  She said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open. “The pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.” “No one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.” An organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien’s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well. Still, he said the community’s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families. “And obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,” he added. Alizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island – from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents. Plus, of course, generators. With power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX. For its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem.  In a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: ""Hurricane Beryl – this dangerous and devastating hurricane – has come and gone and it’s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.” He also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration. On Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope. “I hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they’re able to rebuild the island but I don’t think so”, said Sebastien. “This is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.” Katrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could. “We’re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.” For years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island’s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean.  Heartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl. Beryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h). Thousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. Yet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren’t even worse. “The most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.” “After witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.”",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724x1rjlpno,"Will Grant,",2024-07-03 11:39:21,Unknown
31,Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United have triggered a one-year extension in Erik ten Hag's contract to keep him at the club until 2026.  The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth. ""With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.” United are in talks with Ten Hag to restructure his backroom staff. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was PSV Eindhoven manager from 2022-23, is expected to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.

32,Sutton's Euro 2024 quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

33,EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 09:52:58,Unknown

Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

35,Major safety incident linked to Kevin Campbell death,"Serious concerns over the hospital care of former Arsenal and Everton footballer Kevin Campbell have been flagged up by a health trust, an inquest has heard. Mr Campbell, 54, died at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) on 15 June after being admitted a month earlier. Coroner Zak Golombek said Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the hospital, had declared a Level 5 patient safety incident - the most serious category - about aspects of his care. He said the provisional cause of death given for Mr Campbell was multi-organ failure due to a heart infection. No family members were present at Manchester Coroner's Court as Mr Golombek outlined background details during Thursday's inquest opening. He said that Mr Campbell had been admitted to MRI on 15 May. ""He had been reported to have been fit and well until around January 2024, when he had a number of admissions to hospital before this final admission,” he said. Mr Golombek said the health trust declared a Level 5 incident related to a delay in aspects of Mr Campbell's care and diagnosis, and concerns over decision-making processes concerning palliative care. Mr Golombek said the trust was conducting internal investigations and there would be extra evidence including the investigation report, witness statements from clinicians and a statement from Mr Campbell's next of kin. He said: ""I have also received notification from the trust that a medical cause of death can be offered and, therefore, I will consider evidence from the clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care as to the cause of his death. ""The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis."" He said final determinations on the medical cause of death and the care received by Mr Campbell ""will be made as part of the inquest process"". Proceedings have been adjourned for a hearing at a later date. Mr Campbell’s 24-year-old son Tyrese, who plays for Stoke City, tweeted at the time of his father’s death that ""the pain of this is indescribable and as a son you look at your dad as invincible”. ""He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone."" Kevin Campbell scored 148 goals in 542 appearances in a career involving eight clubs.

37,Who could replace Biden as Democratic nominee?,"US President Joe Biden's feeble debate performance last week sent shockwaves across the Democratic party, raising questions about who could replace him on the presidential ticket should he decide to step down.  The move - though unlikely - would create a logistical nightmare, and could set up an ugly inter-party fight among Democrats just months before voters cast their ballots.  But with Democrats expressing panic and confusion over the future of Mr Biden's candidacy, it has led to discussions about whether the president, 81, is the right candidate to face former President Donald Trump in November. Many Democrats noted the importance of defeating Trump when arguing for or against Mr Biden's claim to the party's nomination.  There are a handful of ways the president could be replaced on the ticket, but chances are slim that Mr Biden would vacate his candidacy with just over four months until the election.  But, if he does, here are some the people who might replace him. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is already on the ticket, is an obvious choice to replace Mr Biden.  As vice president, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights after the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v Wade.  Ms Harris has proved to be a loyal ally to the president and fiercely defended his debate performance. After the event, she admitted the president had a ""slow start"" but argued he went on to provide more substantive answers than Trump.  “People can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance,” Harris told CNN Thursday night.  Ms Harris has the strong name recognition that comes from the job of vice  president, but she has struggled with low approval ratings throughout her tenure.  Forty-nine percent of Americans disapprove of Ms Harris, while 39% approve, according to polling averages tracked by FiveThirtyEight.  Ms Harris will also have a prime-time moment that could vault her ahead of the pack of potential presidential contenders when she faces off against Trump's pick for vice president. The BBC's US media partner CBS is scheduled to host a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention in August.   Gretchen Whitmer, the two term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular mid-west Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  California Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the Biden Administration's fiercest surrogates. He frequently appears on cable news networks praising Mr Biden.  But Mr Newsom has political ambitions of his own.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits have said he would be an appealing stand-in for Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  It is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden Administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as Transportation Secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Mr Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The quick repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  The list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.   Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.  Maryland Governor Wes Moore has found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker are often mentioned, as they have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested senate race in a swing-state, has also been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.  A Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama. Though the former first lady has repeatedly said she does not have presidential aspirations.

41,"Nearly 30,000 evacuated from California wildfires","Tens of thousands of people in northern California have been ordered to evacuate as wildfires grow across the state amid a heatwave. Around 28,000 people were told to leave their homes after the Thompson Fire broke out this week, according to reports citing the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).  Dangerously hot, dry and windy weather is expected to continue, with the National Weather Service predicting temperatures could reach 118F (47C) in some areas early next week.  The city of Oroville, near where the Thompson Fire started, cancelled its 4 July fireworks celebration, and officials warned residents not to use fireworks to avoid the risk of starting blazes.  “The last thing we need is somebody who’s purchased fireworks from a local fire stand going out and doing something stupid,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. “Don’t be an idiot, cause a fire and create more problems for us.” Mr Honea said the area had seen four fires within the last couple weeks and cautioned that danger was far from over. “This is a bad fire season,"" he added. Fire season started recently in California and usually runs until October. The size and intensity of fires in the state have grown in recent years.  The amount of burned areas in the summer in northern and central California increased five times from 1996 to 2021 compared to the 24 year period before, which scientists attributed to human-caused climate change. This week, the National Weather Service issued excessive heat and red flag warnings - indicating hot, dry and windy weather - across the state. The agency said “dangerous” temperatures posed a major to extreme risk of heat stress or illnesses. According to CalFire, around two dozen fires that have burned more than 10 acres sparked across the state since the last week of June. The largest one, at nearly 14,000 acres, was in Fresno county. No one has died, and 74 structures across the state have been destroyed or damaged. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Butte County to provide resources. The Thompson Fire started in Oroville, about 70 miles north of the state capital Sacramento, on Tuesday. The city is around 20 miles from Paradise, which was devastated by the Camp Fire in 2018 that killed 85 people. Fires hit the region again in the years following.  As of Wednesday, 28,000 people had been ordered to evacuate the Oroville area, local CalFire spokesman Rick Carhart told the San Francisco Chronicle. The fire as of Thursday was around 3,500 acres and only 7% contained. Oroville City Council member Shawn Webber posted a video on Facebook on Wednesday showing hillsides charred and smoking on both sides of a road in the area. He wrote that firefighters “have done an excellent job protecting us from even more destruction”. California's state parks system said agencies responding to the fire “also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville”.",2024-07-04 12:23:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c10lve5zr81o,"Mallory Moench,",2024-07-04 11:55:28,Unknown
39,"'I'm as happy as I've been in my life,' says aid worker Simon Boas as he faces death","In September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life.  Over the following year, he knitted together his reflections on life into a book - A Beginner's Guide to Dying. The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication. In what he expects to be one of his final interviews, Simon spoke to Emma Barnett on the Today Programme, offering his reflections on life and death as he moved into hospice care.  My pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.   I used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come. It's been such a great bonus, actually.   The book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this.  In some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West.  I spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible.  I spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me.  I've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people.  It does us all good to think about it.  That's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things.  My family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years... All our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone.  And those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective. I hope people will think, ""I'm glad I read that - Simon's story"". And just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone.  You don't need to have been a politician or a mover and shaker or an aid worker or anything in life. All of us make a huge difference.  I love this quote from George Eliot's Middlemarch:  ""The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.” All of us make a huge difference in life. I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different.  If you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future.  All our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward.  We all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are. I love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands.  So, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu.  However, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family. I'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it.  But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready.  As Julian of Norwich said: ""All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.""  Simon Boas expects to move into a hospice on Thursday where he will be spending his final days surrounded by his family.  When the Today Programme checked in with him that morning he was, unsurprisingly, in good spirts.

40,Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks,"It's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks. Up until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use. But these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono. In 2021, Mr Kono had ""declared war"" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: ""We have won the war on floppy disks!"" Mr Kano has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would ""get rid of the fax machine"".  Once seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change. For instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.  The announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a ""symbol of an anachronistic administration"".  ""The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,"" read another comment on X.  Others comments were more nostalgic. “I wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,” one user wrote. Created in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.  A three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information. Sony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.  As part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.  But Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.  Many Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.  People are moving away from those stamps at a ""glacial pace"", said local newspaper The Japan Times. And it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",2024-07-04 12:23:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o,"Kelly Ng,",2024-07-04 05:23:28,Unknown
42,Brazil blocks Meta from using social media posts to train AI,"Brazil has blocked Meta from using Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. It comes weeks after the company abandoned similar plans to use UK and European users' posts for the same purpose. On Tuesday, Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) said it would immediately suspend Meta's latest privacy policy, which allows it to train generative AI models such as chatbots based on posts from its users. A Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was ""disappointed by the decision"", adding that their approach complied with local privacy laws. ""This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,"" the company added. Meta has a significant market in Brazil. There are 102 million Facebook users and more than 113 million Instagram users in the country. The ANPD said it had acted over the ""imminent risk of serious and irreparable damage, or difficulty repairing fundamental rights of the affected [account] holders"".  Meta was given five working days from ANPD's decision to show it has amended its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information found in public posts to train generative AI. If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935). The company's updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU).  Under its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users' information would be used to ""develop and improve"" its AI products.  In Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages. But that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.  On 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a ""step backwards"" for AI in Europe. However Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil. Pedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD's decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta's data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users. Meta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used. Brazil's data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers' posts could be collected and used to train Meta's AI systems, which could be in breach of the country's data protection law. In addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts. The BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts  from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.

45,Diddy faces new sexual assault case,"Embattled rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is facing another sexual assault case after a  woman came forward with fresh accusations against him. The complaint filed in New York by former porn star Adria English is the latest of several lawsuits filed against the star in recent months.  Mr Combs, who is one of rap's most successful moguls, has consistently denied all allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse, including the latest ones. The star is now reportedly also the subject of a federal criminal investigation, though there is no sign any charges are imminent, according to NBC News. Mr Combs's legal woes have mounted after accusations made by ex-girlfriend Cassandra ""Cassie"" Ventura in November. Earlier this year, he apologised after footage came to light that showed him attacking Ms Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016. The new case against in New York alleges that Mr Combs ""forced and coerced (Ms English) to engage in sex work for him"" at parties. It also alleges that the rapper threatened to ruin her career if she did not comply. A total of 33 allegations are made against Mr Combs and his associates in Ms English's 114-page filing, which gives an account of events between 2004 and 2009. “No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,” his lawyer told US media. The statement went on to say that ""Mr Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court”. Ms English is the latest in a string of women to make claims against Mr Combs in recent months, following a lawsuit launched by Ms Ventura that was settled by Mr Combs in November for an undisclosed sum.  She had accused him of rape and sexual trafficking over a decade. Mr Combs' team clarified that the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. Various allegations of sexual and physical abuse have been made against the rapper since then. His homes in Los Angeles and Miami, Florida, were raided earlier this year as part of a federal investigation into human trafficking. Mr Combs's team has been notified that he is a subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation, according to NBC News, citing two sources familiar with his legal issues. Details of the reported investigation have not been revealed, and neither federal officials or Mr Combs's legal team have commented on the matter specifically.",2024-07-04 14:54:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gl3z3dvyo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 13:54:49,

47,"Chickens, lost rings and other strange polling day stories","On election day, millions of us will be casting our votes.  Around 150,000 polling station staff will be running 40,000 polling stations across the UK.  Electoral service managers will have woken up at the crack of dawn knowing they won't get anymore sleep until well into Friday after the counting is done. It is a big job and a serious business - but here are a few stories from the lighter side of running elections. We've got used to seeing dogs in polling stations.  Poultry, less so.  Council workers Sara Chane and Lindsey Carroll were at the polling station in Skelmersdale, Lancashire in May 2021 for the local elections when a chicken wandered in. With no accompanying human - and no valid voter ID - Sara and Lindsey began trying to track down the chicken's owner, including enlisting the help of a nearby florists, all while continuing to run the polling station. ""Come in, don't mind the chicken, we told voters,"" says Lindsey.  ""She was very lovely, very friendly,"" adds Sara.  Eventually a family of farmers offered to take the chicken away while its rightful owner was tracked down. But minutes later, a five-year-old boy turned up to looking for his pet, who he said was named Matilda. Lindsey says that began a frantic hunt to reunite the boy with Matilda, amid fears the wayward bird had inadvertently been handed to chicken farmers. ""We were panicking at this point,"" says Lindsey. ""Have we given this chicken to someone who is just going to kill her?"" Eventually Matilda was tracked down and reunited with her rightful owners - but not before a little more trauma for the bird. Matilda, it transpired had been placed in a pen with a number of other chickens who had rounded on her and given her a literal hen-pecking. The relieved owners took their pet chicken home and gave her a bath, while Lindsey and Sara carried on with their democratic duties. A few hours later, Matilda's family returned to the polling station with chocolates and a tray of eggs as a thank you for helping them retrieve their fugitive feathered friend. Chickens aren't the only unexpected polling station visitors.  Peter Stanyon, chief executive of Association of Electoral Administrators, recalled one incident from the south-west of England when a voter was on a hunt. Seeing the polling station, they decided the pursuit of democracy was more urgent and rode their horse straight into the polling station. At other times, polling stations can get quiet. Nevertheless clerks find ways of passing the time.  Peter remembers one worker in Merseyside who got in trouble when, during a lull, he volunteered to be a last-minute stand-in Santa Claus for a children's Christmas party in the room above the polling station. He thought he had got away with it but got a shock when the next person to sit on his knee was a council inspector who had come by the polling station to see how things were getting on.  In Wakefield, one woman accidentally dropped her £40,000 engagement ring into the ballot box, along with her ballot paper.  Once sealed, a ballot box cannot be reopened until the election count.  It meant the unfortunate bride-to-be had to turn up at the count hours later and wait for the box to be opened. ""It was a valuable ring,"" says Peter, but ""not more valuable than democracy."" The rule stating that a ballot box cannot be reopened has unfortunate consequences for polling station workers as well as the affianced.  Until about 15 years ago, ballot boxes were closed shut with sealing wax. Occasionally the heat from the wax could lead to smouldering. Polling station workers couldn't open the box to put out the potential flames so instead had to find a way to get liquid into the box to put out the fire without causing too much damage to the votes. Often, the ballot papers aren't damaged by flames, but the voters themselves.  Tom Lynan has been an electoral services manager in West Lancashire for nine years. He says rude words and anatomical drawings on ballot papers are common. During elections for police and crime commissioners, Tom says voters used to like to add Batman or Commissioner Gordon as their second preferences. He also says his sister-in-law once threatened to write spoilers for Game of Thrones episodes on her ballot paper, knowing that he would likely have to read it overnight. Despite that particular challenge, Tom still enjoys his job. He says there is ""pride in being able to facilitate democracy for the people of the borough"".  He says: ""People have protested and fought over the right to vote, and we are the custodians of the process that is the foundation of this country and its values. ""The day before polling day is like Christmas Eve and we are the elves, but rather than presents being delivered it is an election being delivered.""",2024-07-04 14:54:50,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy008l7d5j4o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-04 02:54:50,
48,Ghana chef accused of faking Guinness World Records award,"A Ghanaian chef who claimed to have broken the world record for the longest non-stop cooking by an individual has been arrested over a dispute with his sponsor. Ebenezer Smith held a press conference on Tuesday announcing he was the new world-record holder after cooking continuously for 802 hours and 25 minutes. He presented a certificate purportedly from Guinness World Records (GWR) confirmed him as the record holder. But on Wednesday, a GWR spokesperson told BBC Pidgin the claims were ""not true"" and added that it was ""not our certificate"". In another response to a Ghanaian media outlet, GWR also explained they were not aware of his attempt and that they did not receive an application from him. The chef was arrested by the police shortly after announcing his purported award, over a dispute with his sponsor, the Amadia Shopping Centre, Spintex, in the capital Accra, where he held his cooking marathon in March. They accused him of breaching a contractual agreement by not informing them about the new developments regarding the alleged confirmation of the award. Many Ghanaians have expressed shock and disappointment on social media about the case, which was widely covered when Mr Smith claimed to have broken the record. The chef, who is still in police custody and has not been charged yet, has not commented on the accusations. His unsuccessful record attempt earlier this year attracted the support of several local celebrities. Several Ghanaians have attempted to break Guinness World Records in recent times, including media personality and entrepreneur Afua Asantewaa Aduonum, who attempted the longest singing marathon last year. Earlier this year another chef, Failatu Abdul Razak, attempted the longest cooking marathon in the northern city of Tamale. The current record for longest cooking marathon by an individual is held by Ireland's Alan Fisher at 119 hours, 57 minutes 16 seconds from 28 September-3 October last year, GWR said. It had previously been held by Nigerian chef Hilda Bacci, whose record stood at 93 hours 11 minutes. Her win caused a sensation in Nigeria with people trying to get themselves in the record books by doing things like crying or singing non-stop. She was dethroned by Mr Fisher months after being declared the record holder. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

49,How the BBC reports polling day,"The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election, 4 July. The BBC prepares detailed election guidelines which are written and published for each election, and they include guidance about polling day.  On polling day, the BBC does not report on any of the election campaigns from 06:00 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk, or on social media and other channels. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. The lists of candidates, as well as the manifesto guides, remain available online during polling day. Coverage of what is happening on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather.  It tends to focus on giving information that will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself until the polls have closed. That means no opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until the polls have closed. While the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish ""exit polls"" which includes surveys on how people have said they have voted in the election and may also offer a prediction on the election result based on what voters have said.   The BBC, however, is still able to report on events which are not directly related to the elections; and if there are stories about the mechanics of polling day, especially if they might contain important information to help voters, such as an incident at their local polling station, then that too can be reported, but, of course, with impartiality and editorial justification.  From 22:00 BST, after the close of the polls, the election guidelines no longer apply - but the BBC must still report on the election, of course, with the impartiality requirements set out by both Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines.

52,Teacher who had sex with two schoolboys jailed,"A teacher who had sex with two schoolboys and became pregnant by one of them has been jailed. Rebecca Joynes groomed both boys from the age of 15, first exchanging messages on social media, Manchester Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old was previously convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of sexual activity with another child. Joynes cried and shook in the dock as she was sentenced to six-and-a-half years.  The trial heard that Joynes was 28 when she had come out of a nine-year relationship and was ""flattered"" by the attention of teenage schoolboys. Neither teenager - known as Boy A and Boy B throughout the trial - can be identified due to their age.  Joynes gave birth to Boy B's baby in early 2024, with the child being taken away from her within 24 hours. In a victim impact statement, Boy B said ""one of the hardest things"" was not being told anything about the baby. He added: ""I struggled to come to terms with my abuse, I was completely in denial."" During the trial, he said he felt he had ""betrayed someone I love and done wrong by giving evidence"" but had since realised ""the full extent"" of the abuse and ""tactics used"".  He said he was ""coerced, controlled, manipulated, sexually abused, and mentally abused"", adding: ""I will forever be Rebecca‘s victim and forever linked to her through our child.""  At the sentencing hearing, the judge, Kate Cornell, told Joynes: ""You were the adult, the person in control.  ""You should have known better. You failed to enforce the boundaries of proper conduct but deliberately transgressed them."" The trial heard Joynes would ""laugh off"" inappropriate comments instead of shutting down the behaviour. She gave Boy A all but one of the digits of her mobile phone number as a maths problem-solving exercise in which he had to work out the final digit. They then connected on Snapchat and he sent her flirtatious texts, with the pair agreeing to meet in secret. Boy A lied to his mother that he was staying at a friend's house after school but instead Joynes picked him up and took him to the Trafford Centre, where she bought him a £350 Gucci belt. Judge Cornell said CCTV footage of Joynes buying the belt showed that ""your flirtatious body language and eye contact could hardly be a clearer indication of grooming behaviour"". Back at her flat Joynes had sex twice with Boy A. The next day the boy's mother noticed a love-bite on her son's neck, which he dismissed as ""nothing"". The court heard she stormed into school reception as police were called in about the case. Joynes was then bailed on condition she would have no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18. She told the trial she then moved back to her parents in Wirral after having a ""breakdown"" and she was at a low point when Boy B messaged her on Snapchat.   He later told police they regularly had unprotected sex at her Salford Quays flat and that Joynes had told him she could not become pregnant.  Joynes was arrested for breaking bail conditions and spent five months in custody until she was bailed in November last year. Boy B said in his statement there had been a ""massive mental toll"" on him and his family.   He said he had been told by social services that Joynes had refused to let them update him about the baby's due date, gender or health.  ""The thought of not being able to see my child was heartbreaking,” he added. Judge Cornell said Joynes was a ""high achiever"" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions. ""You felt buoyed and boosted by their attention,"" she added.  ""There's no real insight from you, you continue to deny the offences and have been silent on the distressing impact on these boys.""   Det Con Beth Alexander, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""School should be a place of safety for children. ""It’s clear from some of the public commentary when Joynes was convicted that there is still a lack of understanding when it comes to men and boys being the victims of sexual offences. ""They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they 'should be happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous. ""Women can still be paedophiles; this term is not reserved only for men. Men and boys can still be victims of sexual abuse.” Additional reporting from PA News.

54,Body found in search for child missing in croc attack,"Australian police have found human remains while searching for a 12-year-old they believe was the victim of a crocodile attack. The child was last seen on Tuesday, swimming with family near the remote Aboriginal town of Nganmarriyanga - about a seven-hour drive southwest of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT). “This is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search,” said Senior Sgt Erica Gibson, adding that police would provide support to everyone impacted. Earlier Sgt Gibson had told ABC News that a black crocodile had been seen in the immediate area. As many as 40 members of the community helped police officers in their search for the child, which started shortly after the 12-year-old was reported missing.  They scoured the area by foot, by boat and with the use of helicopters, covering challenging terrain with thick vegetation and a narrow, winding waterway. No details were given on whether the crocodile suspected to have attacked the child had been found. Earlier on Wednesday NT Police Minister Brent Potter said wildlife officers had been authorised to ""remove"" the crocodile from the area once it was located and reiterated the government's safety message. ""We live in a place where crocodiles occupy our water places... it's just a reminder to stay out of the water as best we can."" Found all around the northern edges of Australia - from Broome in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland - saltwater crocodiles were hunted to near extinction but numbers have bounced back since the practice was banned in the 1970s. The NT is now home to an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere else in the world. Attacks though are uncommon. There have been at least two other crocodile attacks in the NT in the past year - a nine-year-old boy was injured in January while swimming in Kakadu National Park, and a farmer escaped a beast's jaws by biting it back in October - but there has not been a fatal attack there since 2018. Queensland, however, has had a series of deadly attacks in recent years, including a 16-year-old boy who was killed in the Torres Strait in April.",2024-07-04 14:54:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c729d8e0r09o,"Katy Watson,",2024-07-04 03:54:52,
50,England's 'massive opportunity' to shock All Blacks,"Fly-half Marcus Smith will be key to England's hopes of securing a first series win in New Zealand New Zealand v England first Test Date: Saturday, 6 July Kick-off: 08:05 BST Venue: Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin Coverage: Listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds and follow live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app. When England last toured New Zealand 10 years ago, the All Blacks were on top of the rugby world. After winning the World Cup in 2011, Steve Hansen's side were on an extraordinary run that would culminate in back-to-back glory in 2015. A new crop of future All Blacks stars were coming through, while all-time greats like Richie McCaw and Dan Carter were still in their prime. Even without the injured Carter, and despite strong English performances in the first two Tests, the All Blacks eventually secured a 3-0 series win to cement their status as the dominant rugby nation on earth. The landscape is different in 2024. South Africa and France have stolen a march - the Springboks on the pitch and the French off it. The Japanese league has coaxed some great All Blacks into international sabbaticals or international retirements. Covid took its toll. ""It's been a few tough years, there is no doubt about that,"" said New Zealand Rugby Union boss Mark Robinson. The Henry-Hansen-Ian Foster lineage - which ran the All Blacks for 20 years - has been broken up, with the popular former flanker Scott Robertson, 49, now at the helm after guiding the Crusaders to a remarkable seven consecutive Super Rugby titles. ""He has spent a huge amount of time developing his craft,"" said Robinson. ""He's thought really deeply about the role for a long time. It feels this is the time for him."" But despite the excitement around the Robertson era, the New Zealand rugby public - often so bullish - is a little nervous.  The All Blacks haven't played a game since losing the World Cup final last October, while a host of key players including locks Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick, scrum-half Aaron Smith and fly-half Richie Mo'unga are no longer available. With Sam Cane stepping down as captain, second row Scott Barrett will lead the team for the first time, while Damian McKenzie starts at fly-half. ""There is uncertainty about how this team is going to come together,"" explained Liam Napier of the New Zealand Herald. ""I look at this New Zealand squad and there are so many unknowns,"" agreed former England scrum-half Danny Care. ""They don't have the players anymore that you fear. They have players you massively respect, but as a team, do you go there literally with fear? I don’t think New Zealand has that at the moment. ""This is a massive opportunity for England to go down there and shock the New Zealand world."" Perofeta gets All Blacks nod to face England Rugby Union Daily: New Zealand's new era England prop Marler to start against New Zealand Among the local media, England's sharp performances at the back end of the Six Nations and the polished display in the win against Japan in Tokyo have not gone unnoticed. Nor has the continuity in Steve Borthwick's selection or the tweak in playing style since last autumn's World Cup. ""It’s not traditional England - they have evolved,"" said Napier. ""Maybe England have a chance to surprise the All Blacks with their style. ""There is cohesion there and they have named largely the same team. But how is this All Blacks team going to come together? No-one is quite sure."" While Borthwick has had his whole squad in camp for almost four weeks, Robertson has had his together for just 10 days. Leaders like Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett missed the Super Rugby season while playing in Japan.  ""I’m nervous,"" World Player of the Year Savea admitted on Thursday. ""But nerves bring the best out of us. And it's a great challenge for myself to step forward and try and own it."" ""You hope England can maybe catch New Zealand a little bit on the hop,"" said Care. ""There are a lot of things that put the All Blacks in a different space to where they have been in years gone by,"" added former England wing Chris Ashton. Despite all this, England supporters will be cautious in their optimism. The All Blacks still boast some world-class players, whether in the form of the magnificent Savea or the talented Jordie Barrett [the third of the brothers in the matchday squad]. TJ Perenara is back at scrum-half after a two-year absence. Robertson can even afford to leave the great Beauden Barrett out of his starting XV. England’s inexperienced side - the vast majority of whom have never played in New Zealand - will be tested both mentally and physically. It is the All Blacks in New Zealand and it remains - according to Borthwick - the biggest challenge in world rugby. But it nonetheless feels like England have a once-in-a-generation chance of making history, and becoming only the third English side - after 1973 and 2003 - to win a Test in New Zealand. Under Robertson, the All Blacks will only improve going forward. Any cobwebs will be blown away, and quickly.  Next week's second Test is at Eden Park in Auckland, the spiritual home of All Blacks rugby, where their record is incomprehensibly good. For England, Saturday in Dunedin might be a case of now or never.",2024-07-04 14:54:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cleyn3nd72lo,Chris Jones,2024-07-04 14:07:52,

55,Starmer set to be PM as Tories face worst defeat - exit poll,"Labour is set to win a general election landslide with a majority of 170, according to an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky. If the forecast is accurate, Sir Keir Starmer will become prime minister with 410 Labour MPs – just short of Tony Blair's 1997 total. The Conservatives are predicted to slump to 131 MPs, their lowest number ever. The Liberal Democrats are projected to come third with 61 MPs.  The Scottish National Party will see its number of MPs fall to 10, while Reform UK is forecast to get 13 MPs, according to the exit poll.  The Green Party of England and Wales is predicted to double its number of MPs to two and Plaid Cymru is set to get four MPs. Others are forecast to get 19 seats. The exit poll, overseen by Sir John Curtice and a team of statisticians, is based on data from voters at about 130 polling stations in England, Scotland and Wales. The poll does not cover Northern Ireland. At the past five general elections, the exit poll has been accurate to within a range of 1.5 and 7.5 seats. If the exit poll is correct it will be a remarkable turnaround for the Labour Party, which had its worst post-war election result in 2019, when the Conservatives under Boris Johnson won an 80 seat majority. The Conservatives may avoid the wipe-out predicted by some opinion polls but they are still set for the worst result in the party's history, losing 241 MPs - a devastating blow after 14 years in government. It will mean a Labour prime minister in Downing Street for the first time since 2010 and a likely battle for the future direction of the Conservatives if, as seems likely, Rishi Sunak stands down as leader.  The Tory losses are likely to have been inflicted by the resurgent Liberal Democrats and Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which looks set to win more seats than many polls predicted.  We will have to wait until the early hours, when the bulk of results start rolling in, to see if the exit poll is accurate.  Labour's predicted landslide would be just short of the 179 majority won by Tony Blair in 1997 and the party may achieve it on a smaller share of the vote than former leader Jeremy Corbyn won in 2017, according to Sir John Curtice. But it will be seen as a vindication of Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to change his party and move it back to the centre ground of British politics. Labour shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson won the Houghton and Sunderland South constituency, in the first result of the night. She said in her victory speech: ""Tonight the British people have spoken, and if the exit poll this evening is again a guide to results across our country as it so often is, then after 14 years the British people have chosen change. ""They have chosen Labour and they have chosen the leadership of Keir Starmer. Today our country with its proud history has chosen a brighter future."" In a pattern that looks set to be repeated throughout the night, the Reform UK candidate in the north-east England constituency came second ahead of the Conservative by a large margin. The Liberal Democrats are, meanwhile, set to squeeze the Tory vote in the south of England, where a number of Conservative cabinet members, including Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, are looking vulnerable. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""It looks like this will be our best result for a generation."" Rishi Sunak had insisted he could still win right to the end despite failing to make a dent in Labour's commanding opinion poll lead over the six-week campaign.  Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told BBC Radio 4: ""This is a very difficult moment for the Conservative Party."" He said he was ""very sorry"" that the exit poll is projecting that a number of his colleagues will lose their seats. On keeping his own seat, he says ""we will have to wait and see"". On Wednesday - the day before the election - Mr Stride made headlines when he admitted he thought it was likely there would be a massive Labour majority, effectively conceding defeat. Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""not a good night"" for the SNP, which is predicted to lose 38 seats, adding that she believed the prediction would be ""broadly right"". Rishi Sunak surprised many in his own party by announcing a summer election. But his campaign was hit by a series of gaffes, from the rain-drenched announcement in Downing Street to his decision to leave a D-Day celebration in Normandy early to record a TV interview and confused messaging about a Labour ""super majority"".",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xnzlzz99o,"Brian Wheeler,",2024-07-04 21:10:05,
56,Labour set for general election landslide - exit poll,"Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent As they wait for more results, some Conservatives are turning their fury on Rishi Sunak’s inner circle. Shortly before polls closed, Sunak announced a string of honours for former cabinet ministers such as Theresa May and Chris Grayling. He also gave a peerage to Liam Booth-Smith, his chief of staff, and a knighthood to Oliver Dowden, his deputy prime minister.

Sunak’s pledge to bring integrity back to politics when he entered Downing Street has proven to be a total lie. This an utter disgrace."" That gives you a flavour of the recriminations which are beginning right now. Sir Charles Walker, who stood down as a Conservative MP at the election, responded to that quote in our radio studio just now, saying: ""The idea that people in the Conservative Party are going to be as sanguine and magnanimous as I am, is for the birds.""",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn09xn9je7lt,Unknown,Unknown,
57,Sir John Curtice: Understanding the exit poll numbers,"Labour have likely secured their anticipated landslide victory, though the party may have fallen just short of the majority Tony Blair won in the 1997 general election. They may have achieved this on a smaller share of the vote than former leader Jeremy Corbyn secured in 2017. Both the Conservative share of the vote and their seat tally could be the lowest in the party’s history. Their seat tally might be affected by their vote falling more heavily in seats where they were previously strongest - a pattern that is largely because support for Reform has risen most there. To add to the Conservatives’ travails, the rise in Labour support is stronger in seats where the party started off second to them. Equally, the Lib Dems have performed especially well in seats where they started second to the Conservatives - and particularly in ones the party held until 2015. It is these patterns that, above all, help explain why the Conservative seat tally is expected to be so low. It appears the Conservatives have suffered heavily in places where more than a third of households have a mortgage – a reflection perhaps of the damage caused by former prime minister Liz Truss’s “fiscal event"". It looks as though Reform UK may win more seats than many polls suggested. This is largely because the Conservative vote has fallen far in seats they previously held, but also because Reform have advanced most in seats where more people voted Leave in 2016. This is especially the case in seats being defended by the Conservatives. Reform are also inevitably advancing more strongly in seats that the Conservatives won in 2017 - where the Brexit Party did not stand in 2019. However, how many seats Reform will win is highly uncertain. Our model suggests there are many places where they have a chance - but a relatively low one - of winning. Meanwhile, Labour’s vote is up more in seats where a large part of the population say they are in bad health - a measure of relative deprivation - and in places where more people voted Leave in 2016. The party also seems to be advancing strongly in Scotland but less well in Wales, where they have held power in the Senedd since 2021. While the Lib Dems are doing relatively well in seats where they start second to the Tories, conversely their vote has been squeezed somewhat in places where the Conservatives were facing a challenge from Labour. They also appear to be doing better in places with a relatively high Leave vote, which was one of Ed Davey’s objectives. The Greens are performing particularly well in places where the population is relatively young. Their success in these places may help to explain why Labour’s share of the vote nationally might be less than 40%. The Greens may still only pick up two or three seats, despite recording their highest-ever general election vote share because of its even distribution across the country. In Scotland, it appears the SNP have suffered a more substantial reverse than was anticipated by most polls. Though the decline in the party’s support appears to be lower in places where a high proportion of people identify as Scottish rather than British. The exit poll only has a small number of sampling points in Scotland. If the poll has even slightly overestimated Labour’s advantage over the SNP, the latter’s tally could end up being higher. The forecast for the SNP - and for Scotland in general, where the exit poll is pointing to substantial Labour gains - must thus be treated with a great deal of caution.",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2x0g8nkzmzo,"Sir John Curtice,",2024-07-04 22:10:05,
58,"What's happening in UK election, and what comes next?","Voting has ended and Britain’s Labour Party is projected to have won the UK’s general election with a landslide victory. If the projection based on exit polls is correct, Sir Keir Starmer’s centre-left party will return to power with a large majority after 14 years of right-wing government under the Conservatives. And Mr Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who only entered Parliament in 2015, will become the new UK prime minister on Friday after seeing the King at Buckingham Palace. Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, meanwhile, will have led the Conservatives to their worst result in decades. Exit polls are not official results but they have proved increasingly accurate since the mid-1990s. Now comes the process of confirming the official result. It will be a long night of vote counting and there will undoubtedly be plenty of storylines to follow along the way. Here's what you can expect, and what it means. Like we said, the exit poll is not an official result but has in recent elections been a very reliable indicator of who will form the new government.  The UK runs a parliamentary system with 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of these represents an individual constituency - basically an area – somewhere in the country. The exit poll projects Labour to win 410 seats, the Conservatives 131, the centrist Liberal Democrats 61 and Reform UK (a successor to the Brexit Party) on 13. Other parties and independents will take the rest of the seats. This result would give Labour a huge 170-seat majority.  Right now, election officials in each constituency are busy counting votes, and at some point in the evening will declare their results. Whoever gets the most votes wins and becomes the MP for the area. Some local areas pride themselves on being among the first in the country to announce their winners. Houghton and Sunderland South was the first - returning Labour MP Bridget Phillipson - who is expected to become education secretary in the next government. The announcement of results – often held in school halls – are usually televised. All candidates in a constituency – including those running as a joke – are present on stage. So, on that note, watch out for Count Binface, who is challenging Mr Sunak in his northern English constituency. But perhaps of more political significance will be some of the senior Conservatives who will lose their seats.  Steve Baker, a cabinet minister, and Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader, are projected to have a less than 1% chance of keeping theirs. Jeremy Hunt, who serves as chancellor - the UK's equivalent of a finance minister - has a less than 20% chance. Grant Shapps, the defence minister, and Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, could also lose their seats. That all depends. It will come when it's clear which party will hit the magic number of 326 seats. That figure represents a majority in parliament, meaning the party has enough MPs to be able to pass laws without needing the help of any other party. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister, after the King officially invites them to form a government. The leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes what’s known as the leader of the opposition. If the incumbent prime minister loses, the changeover is quick, compared with many other countries. So if this exit poll is correct, Mr Sunak will probably be out of 10 Downing Street – the UK equivalent of the White House -  within a day, with Mr Starmer installed soon after. In late May, facing a significant deficit in the polls, Rishi Sunak surprised many in his own party as well as political pundits by deciding to call a snap election, triggering a six-week election campaign. The Conservatives have held power since 2010 and the country has seen five leaders in that time – including a tumultuous period in 2022 when the UK had three prime ministers in a matter of weeks. For its part, Labour hasn’t won a general election since 2005 and its last result in 2019 under left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn was its worst for almost a century. Keir Starmer sought to show voters during the campaign that the party had moved on, while calling for a change in government after a long period of Conservative government. Mr Sunak, meanwhile, tried to sell the record of his party, and repeatedly warned voters against handing Labour a large majority.",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v0e074jejo,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-04 22:35:05,
64,Hurricane Beryl leaves Jamaican homes without power,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica remain without power in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - swept along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night, bringing more than 12 hours of heavy rain. Officials and residents are assessing the damage after an island-wide curfew was lifted early on Thursday. Beryl, which has now weakened to a category three storm, is headed for Mexico and the Cayman Islands. It left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, killing at least 10 people. St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Venezuela reported three deaths each, while one person died in Jamaica.  The storm destroyed almost every home on two small islands in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Jamaican energy provider JPS said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” King Charles III, who is also monarch in several Caribbean nations, said on Thursday he was ""profoundly saddened to learn of the dreadful destruction"" left by Hurricane Beryl. The UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. Beryl became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

59,'Meat assaults' - Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 23:10:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:10:06,
60,All you need to know about election night,"Settle in, folks - it’s going to be a long night. Our election night watcher’s guide includes key timings and the pivotal seats you should watch out for as we wait to find out who will be the next prime minister. We’ll also be telling you where you can watch, listen and read everything you need to know about the results from across the BBC. So if you’re staying up, we hope you’ve got Friday booked off and you’re stocked up on snacks and coffee. Now make yourself comfortable. This is the first big moment of the night. Voters in more than 130 constituencies are polled across the country on behalf of broadcasters. The results allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won across Britain. The exit poll isn’t always exactly right, but more often than not it gives a good indication of where we’re heading. The result is being projected on the BBC’s London HQ, Broadcasting House. Staying up past then? We’ve got you covered. Online: Follow all the election developments and results on the BBC News website and app, where we’ll be running a live page through the night with analysis from correspondents and experts. TV: The BBC’s Election 2024 programme with Laura Kuenssberg, Clive Myrie and Chris Mason begins on BBC One and BBC News at 21:55 BST. You can also keep up to date by tuning in to the BBC News Channel and the Election 2024 livestream on BBC iPlayer. There will also be dedicated results programmes in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Sunderland used to be famous for getting the first result out but this year it could come from nearby Blyth and Ashington, a new seat. This is traditional Labour territory but includes towns where voters have switched to the Tories in recent years. The important thing to watch out for here will be the size of any swing towards Labour, which will provide the first bit of hard data pointing to how the party has performed nationally. Remember, all result timings are estimates and could change. Radio: Check in with Nick Robinson, Rachel Burden and Henry Zeffman on Radio 4 and 5 Live. The Newscast podcast team are hosting a watch-along with 150 listeners at the BBC's London HQ. A special edition of the podcast will be available on Friday morning. Listen here. Not many results are due in around midnight - can you resist the urge to go to bed during this lull? There could be an early eye-catching result in Swindon South, where Labour hope to unseat former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. That would be ominous for Rishi Sunak - and he’ll also be concerned if the Liberal Democrats make an early breakthrough in Harrogate and Knaresborough. Starting to feel those first flickers of tiredness? Well, it’s about to start picking up. The big result to look out for is Darlington, which the Tories took from Labour in 2019 under Boris Johnson. Similarly, watch out for Wrexham at around 01:30. To put it simply, if Labour isn’t winning this sort of place back, it probably isn’t winning. In Basildon and Billericay, we’ll find out if Conservative Party chairman Richard Holden’s relocation to this usually safe Tory seat has paid dividends for him. Keep your eyes peeled for Rutherglen, which is due to be the first result from Scotland. We’ll start to find out if pro-independence voters have stuck with the SNP, stayed at home or switched to Labour. Online: Remember, you can see all the results online and they will be updated throughout the night. International users can access all BBC News election content on BBC.com. Boris Johnson won a string of seats in traditional Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England in 2019 on a promise to “get Brexit done”.  Watch out for places like Bolsover, West Bromwich and Hartlepool. They'll start to give us a sense of whether the Conservatives have held on to these so-called red wall constituencies or whether Labour has won them back. If you’re reading this shortly after polls close and wondering what time to wake up in order to see the big moments, this would be a good time to set your alarm for. According to BBC polling guru Prof Sir John Curtice, an eventual result could be forecast by broadcasters around this time in the event of a landslide. It wouldn’t be official - it would just mean that based on the results so far, the BBC and others might feel confident enough to ""call it"". Between 02:30 and 03:00, we’re expecting the pace of declarations to really pick up - so if you’ve got to get up for work soon, walk away now while you still can. Watch for Na h-Eileanan an Iar - this island constituency off Scotland’s west coast might have the smallest population of any in the UK, but it will give us an early sign of whether Labour are breaking through north of the border. In Northern Ireland, the performance of the DUP could be the story of the night. Party leader Gavin Robinson is facing a strong challenge from Naomi Long, the leader of the Alliance Party, in Belfast East, while in South Antrim, the Ulster Unionist Party thinks it has a good chance of returning to Westminster by beating the DUP. The DUP is also under pressure from Alliance in Lagan Valley, which is the seat formerly held by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who resigned as DUP leader earlier this year when he was charged with historical sex offences, which he denies. That result is due a bit later. If you’re staying up, get some coffee and strap in - because if alarm bells aren’t already ringing for one of the two main parties, they soon will be. Bellwether seats like Nuneaton and Stevenage are hotly contested places which have switched between Labour and Tory. The party that wins in Dartford has gone on to form a government at every election since 1964. Keep an eye on Scarborough and Whitby too. In short, if Labour are winning these seats, they‘re likely to be on for a comfortable majority - and if they’re not, then the pollsters may want to keep a low profile for a while. Sir Keir Starmer will be watching from Holborn and St Pancras, where his result is due at around the same time as his predecessor’s. Jeremy Corbyn will be learning his fate down the road in Islington North, where he is standing as an independent. Also watch Chingford and Woodford Green, where Labour’s attempt to unseat former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has been complicated by its former candidate Faiza Shaheen running as an independent.  Then there is Rochdale, where we'll find out if ex-Labour MP George Galloway’s recent by-election victory was a temporary protest vote or if he’s there to stay. In Wales, a good night for Plaid Cymru would mean holding on to their seats in west Wales - which, because of boundary changes, would mean beating Rishi Sunak’s chief whip Simon Hart in Caerfyrddin - and taking Ynys Môn from the Tories. They’re due around this time. If you’re still with us by this stage, then in the words of Chris Mason, you clearly ooze stamina. Now it’s going to get hectic. About one fifth of all the results are due to be announced in a 30-minute window from 03:30. Attention will turn to senior Tories in seats where pre-election polls suggested they could lose. Watch for: There may be some high drama in Surrey, where Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is being pushed by the Lib Dems in Godalming and Ash. A sitting chancellor has never lost their seat but if things are going really badly for the Tories, that could change. Elsewhere, we'll get a sense of how the Lib Dems and Greens are doing. Both Wimbledon and South Cambridgeshire are key Lib Dem targets, but the party will need a much bigger swing to win somewhere like Chichester, which is Education Secretary Gillian Keegan’s seat. If they win there, they’re having a very good night. In Bristol Central, Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer has one of the party’s best chances of taking a new seat. The party’s other leader, Adrian Ramsay, will hope to win in Waveney Valley - though we’re not expecting that result until closer to 04:30. Rishi Sunak’s constituency Richmond and Northallerton isn’t due to declare until around this time, by which time his party’s fate may already be sealed. This could well be the first time in the evening we hear him speak. Reform UK has shaken up this election but will it make it into the Commons? At around 04:00, we’ll find out if Nigel Farage has won in Clacton, a race that marks his eighth attempt to become an MP. Two other big Reform targets are due around that time, too - Richard Tice in Boston and Skegness and Lee Anderson in Ashfield. Elsewhere, the picture in Scotland should be pretty clear after the Glasgow results are through. The SNP will feel it has weathered the storm if it limits any losses there - but Labour wins in Glasgow South and Glasgow West could indicate a real shift across the country. Winning back Gordon Brown’s old seat Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy from the SNP would be a big symbolic moment for Labour, and the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn will hope to prevent any revival in Aberdeen South. Noticed that strange glowing light at the window? That’s the sun coming up. If you’re still awake by now, give yourself a big pat on the back. By the time it’s light, we are likely to know who will form the next government, because enough seats should have been declared for a party to pass the 326 seats needed for a majority. In the event of a Labour landslide or a very comfortable win, we could already have reached that point earlier in the night, closer to 04:00. If the Tories have defied the polls or the election is close, it could come later. If you are still up by now, you are either: a) extraordinarily caffeinated or, b) Professor Sir John Curtice. Either way, you have earned your election night stripes. Mercifully, there should be a bit of a breather around this time as the pace of results slow - but there are some big ones still to come. Deciding to run in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East led to Douglas Ross announcing he will quit as leader of the Scottish Conservatives due to internal party anger over his attempt to serve in Westminster and Holyrood at the same time. We’re due to find out if it was worth it. Johnny Mercer is another high-profile Tory figure facing a tough challenge. Labour hope to take his Plymouth Moor View seat at around this point in the morning. At around 05:30, we’re expecting to get Liz Truss’s result in South West Norfolk. People who went to bed after the exit poll will be waking up to a set of results that is more or less complete, with counting only continuing in very close seats or ones that started late for logistical reasons. If things have gone badly for the Tories, we could still see some big names losing their seats at this point - for example, Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker in Wycombe and Jonathan Gullis, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, in Stoke-on-Trent North. Whatever the result, the focus will now start moving to victory speeches, recriminations, resignations and what the new government will look like. Results night might be over, but really, the big stuff is just beginning - so if you’ve been with us all night, for goodness sake, go to bed.

61,Violent attacks shock France ahead of crunch vote,"A growing number of candidates and activists in France have been targeted with violent or verbal attacks in the run-up to Sunday's tense final round of parliamentary elections. Government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot was putting up election posters with her deputy and a party activist in Meudon, south-west of Paris, when they were brutally assaulted by a gang of youths. Other election campaigners have come under attack across France, reflecting the febrile mood in politics with the far-right National Rally (RN) the front-runner in the election. The motive for the attack on Ms Thevenot and her colleagues is not clear, but she returned to Meudon on Thursday with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who condemned ""attacks of intolerable cowardice"". Images filmed from a block of flats showed the youths swarming around the candidate, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist for President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble alliance. Ms Thevenot told Le Parisien website that when she and her colleagues objected to the youths defacing party posters ""they immediately attacked one of my activists, injuring Virginie"". Ms Lanlo suffered an arm injury, while the activist was punched and hit with a scooter, ending up with a broken jaw. The car windscreen was also smashed by the scooter. Three teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested by police and the incident was quickly condemned across the political spectrum.  Mr Attal called on people to ""reject the climate of violence and hatred that's taking hold"", while RN leader Jordan Bardella said one of his ""big commitments as prime minister"" would be to ""combat record insecurity and repeat offending"". Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has announced that 30,000 police will be deployed across France for Sunday's vote in an attempt to prevent ""the ultra-left or ultra-right"" from stirring up trouble.  The BBC spoke to voters in his constituency in northern France on Thursday who said they feared youths would go on the rampage whoever won, to express their anger at the political system. Law and order is one of RN's big priorities, alongside immigration and tax cuts to target the cost-of-living crisis. RN candidates have also come under attack. Marie Dauchy described being ""violently assaulted"" as she campaigned at a market in La Rochette near Grenoble in the south-east.  A conservative candidate allied with RN, Nicolas Conquer, complained that he and a female colleague had been pelted with eggs. And last month another RN candidate was treated in hospital after he was set upon while handing out pamphlets. Having won 33.2% of the vote in the first round of the snap election, called out of the blue by President Macron, Mr Bardella's party is now aiming to win an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.  But his political opponents have agreed to do all they can to block the far right from winning enough seats to form a government. Seventy-six seats were won outright in the first round by candidates who won more than half the local vote in their constituency, including 39 RN candidates and their allies. The other 501 seats will be settled in run-off votes, and 217 third-placed candidates have pulled out of the race to hand a rival a better chance of defeating RN. Of those 217 withdrawals, 130 candidates came from the left-wing New Popular Front and 81 from the Macron alliance. Marine Le Pen has complained bitterly about the operation to secure ""mass withdrawals"", and blamed those who sought to ""stay in power against the will of the people"". However, she said she thought there was still a chance of winning an absolute majority, if the electorate turned out in big numbers. The latest Ifop poll suggests RN will win 210-240 seats, short of the 289 it needs to form a government. That is down on the 240-270 range of seats that it was estimated to win after the first round. Nevertheless there is fear among some of France's minorities of what RN might do if it gets into power. It aims to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing and to abolish the right to automatic French citizenship for children of foreign parents, if those children have spent five years in France from the age of 11 to 18. Dual citizens would also be barred from dozens of sensitive jobs.

62,Israel tells Gaza ceasefire negotiators to resume work,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to send a team of negotiators to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas. US President Joe Biden welcomed the development, which comes a day after Hamas responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan he outlined in late May. The last indirect talks took place in Cairo earlier that month. Details of Hamas's latest response have not been made public, but a Palestinian official told the BBC that the group was no longer demanding a full ceasefire at the outset of the plan presented by Mr Biden. A senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to ""pretty significant adjustments"" to its position. ""We've had a breakthrough on a critical impasse,"" the US official said, although he stressed that ""this does not mean this deal is going to be closed in the period of days"".  President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu held a phone call on Thursday, which focused on the hostages and ceasefire negotiations, the official said.  On Wednesday, Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators from Egypt and Qatar about ideas it had been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting, until it eliminates Hamas. When he announced the plan on 31 May, President Biden said it was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal, and that it involved three phases. The first would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third phase the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. After the two leaders' phone call on Thursday, the Israeli government said in a statement: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu updated President Biden on his decision to send a delegation to continue the hostage negotiations and reiterated the principles that Israel is committed to, especially its commitment to end the war only after all of its goals have been achieved."" Mr Netanyahu has declared his objectives to be the return of all remaining hostages, the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensuring Gaza no longer constitutes a threat to Israel.  The White House said Mr Biden ""welcomed the prime minister's decision to authorise his negotiators to engage with US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an effort to close out the deal"". A source in the Israeli negotiating team meanwhile told Reuters news agency that Hamas's response included ""a very significant breakthrough"" and that there was ""a deal with a real chance of implementation"". A senior Palestinian official told the BBC earlier on Thursday that Hamas had given up the demand for a complete ceasefire. Its new conditions, the official said, related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from a strip of land running along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of the response Hamas submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere was positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he is “committed to the Israeli proposal welcomed by President Biden”, although he has not publicly endorsed the outline as it was laid out. The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,010 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.  Hamas and allied armed groups are believed to still be holding 116 hostages who were taken on 7 October. At least 42 are presumed by Israeli authorities to be dead. The others have been released, rescued or their bodies recovered. Four other Israelis have been held hostage since 2014 and 2015, two of whom are presumed dead.

63,Exit poll: What is the forecast in my area?,"The Labour Party is forecast to win a landslide majority in Parliament, according to an exit poll published as voting ended in the 2024 general election. Labour is set to take 410 seats, well ahead of the Conservatives on 131, according to the forecast based on the poll carried out by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. This suggests Labour is on course for a majority of 170 seats, although they may have fallen just short of the majority Tony Blair won in 1997. The Liberal Democrats are currently forecast to win 61 seats, Reform UK 13, the SNP 10, Plaid Cymru is on four and the Green Party two. Other parties, including those in Northern Ireland, are forecast to get 19 seats. Enter your postcode or a constituency name to find what the exit poll forecast is currently suggesting may happen in your area. Bear in mind that this is only an indication of what may happen. Sir John Curtice, who leads the exit poll team, says the number of seats Reform will win is particularly uncertain. He explains: “Our model suggests there are many places where they have some, but a relatively low, chance of winning.” This look-up will be updated as results come in and the forecasts are modified. The exit poll is a way of forecasting what may happen in the general election, after voting ends but before the results are known. The poll focuses on revealing national trends and is mainly used to forecast which party may form the government at Westminster. Forecasting results at a constituency level is harder, especially if there are local factors that make the election distinct in any particular seat. Researchers at 133 polling stations across England, Scotland and Wales ask around 20,000 people to indicate which way they voted. A team of academics led by Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, uses this and other data to estimate the vote share per party in each constituency and then to forecast each party's likelihood of winning in any given seat. All the individual probabilities are added together to arrive at the forecast seat totals for each party. The exit poll is not held in Northern Ireland so the 18 seats there are labelled “Other”. The model is updated throughout the night as results come in, so seat totals and individual constituencies are likely to change. These maps show the exit poll forecast across England, Wales and Scotland. In the locations coloured grey, the contest is very close. Everywhere else is coloured by the party currently considered most likely to win. When an actual result is declared it will overwrite the exit poll data in this map, and in the postcode lookup above.  Again, the forecasts may change over the night. You will need to refresh this page to see those updates. Rural constituencies are larger than those in cities because the population is more spread out. So here is the same data in a cartogram, where each constituency is shown as equal in size. The cartogram is a way of viewing each seat as the same size, while attempting to show roughly where in the UK they are. All the seats are correctly within the right nation and English region, but they may not follow typical geography beyond that. There are some, mostly around London - whose high population density distorts the map most significantly - that are in different places to where you'd expect, no longer neighbouring the seats they lie next to geographically. All declaration times estimated by the BBC are approximate and the actual results may happen earlier or later than stated. As with the main results, all 2019 figures are notional, because of boundary changes. You can read more about that here.

67,Jill Biden: The quiet influence of Biden's closest adviser,"A day after US President Joe Biden struggled through a 90-minute debate that only served to fuel voter concerns about his age and fitness, Jill Biden stood before well-heeled donors at a New York fundraiser and tried to explain what they had all witnessed.  ""'You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened. I didn’t feel that great,'"" the president had confessed, she told them. ""I said, ‘Look, Joe, we are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you’ve been president.’” It offered an early glimpse into the president's mindset and how he rated his debate performance, which was widely panned as a major blow to his campaign. As doubts about Mr Biden's candidacy began to circulate, his closest adviser was unequivocal about whether he would step out of the race. ""When he gets knocked down, Joe gets back up, and that’s what we’re doing today,"" Mrs Biden said. The first lady has stood beside her husband throughout his decades-long career, from his time as a Delaware senator to becoming commander-in-chief, often serving as the decisive voice behind many of Mr Biden's political choices.  While the president often turns to his tight-knit family on big decisions, Mrs Biden is among a handful of top advisers who wield the most influence over the president and could ultimately help him determine whether it is time to step out of the race.  “It’s fair to call her Biden’s closest adviser,” veteran Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkop told the BBC. “Family matters to him significantly and that makes Jill Biden’s role even more important.” The president’s younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who served as his campaign manager during his years in the Senate, as well as his son, Hunter Biden, are also among his most trusted confidantes.  After the fallout from the debate, Mr Biden huddled with his family for a long-planned trip to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, where they discussed the fate of his campaign and urged him to keep fighting, according to the BBC's US partner CBS. Hunter Biden was among the most vocal family members urging his father to remain in the race, CBS reported.  But as Democratic anxiety over the  81-year-old president's physical and mental stamina has spilled into public view in recent days, many inside the party have looked to the first lady for any hint of wavering over his candidacy.  Instead, she has continued to hit the campaign trail, travelling to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan this week for a string of political and official events. ""Because there's a lot of talk out there, let me repeat what my husband has said plainly and clearly: Joe is the Democratic nominee and he is going to beat Donald Trump, just like he did in 2020,"" Mrs Biden told supporters at a campaign event in Traverse City, Michigan, on Wednesday.  Mrs Biden's influence in the West Wing, however, is not unusual.  Nancy Kegan Smith, president of the First Ladies Association for Research and Education, said there are historic parallels between Mrs Biden and former first ladies. ""Most presidents depend on the uncoloured advice of their wives because that’s the person who is normally closest to them,” she said. She pointed to Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of former President Lyndon B Johnson, who advised her husband - ultimately convincing him with a moving letter - to run for the White House in August 1964 after he became president following the assassination of John F Kennedy. Four years later in 1968, she changed her opinion, telling him to not run for re-election. He listened, Ms Kegan Smith said. Many in the Democratic Party are waiting to see if a similar scenario may unfold in the next month, placing a greater spotlight on Mrs Biden. The first lady keeps a busy schedule. She is the first in the East Wing to keep a day job teaching English at a northern Virginia community college. When she is not teaching, she is often on the road campaigning for her husband. “Most modern first ladies have been in the political game for quite a while and have been political sounding boards to their husbands,” Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University professor who studies first ladies, told BBC News. The president proposed five times before Mrs Biden said yes, and the couple married in 1977, five years after Mr Biden lost his first wife and daughter in a car crash that also injured his two sons. When he decided not to run for president in 2016, he told 60 Minutes ""it was the right decision for the family"". He cited his reasoning was in part because of the loss of his son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.  Mrs Biden specifically played a role in her husband's decision not to run for president in 2003, Ms Kegan Smith said, pointing to a scene described in the first lady's 2019 memoir, Where the Light Enters. In the book, she recalled lounging by the pool as Democratic advisers inside encouraged her husband to launch a campaign. Wearing a bikini, she wrote ""no"" on her stomach in magic marker and walked through the meeting. Biden did not enter the race that year.  But the first lady has also come under pressure in recent days, facing criticism after the presidential debate for praising her husband after his poor showing on the debate stage.  “Joe, you did such a great job. You answered every question. You knew all the facts,” she told him on stage at a post-debate rally in Atlanta. A clip of the exchange was widely mocked on social media. Some Republicans have also seized on Democratic worry, laying blame on the first lady for Mr Biden's debate performance. Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican from Wyoming, even accused Mrs Biden of “elder abuse” in a post on X, for “rolling him out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed”. The Drudge Report, a conservative website, ran a headline on its front page immediately after the debate that read: “Cruel Jill clings to power.” “It’s really unfair to put the burden on her. She’s his spouse. She’s not a politician,"" Michael LaRosa, her former press secretary, told The Hill. “It’s not up to her to save the Democratic Party."" Mrs Biden, meanwhile, has stressed that the president's bid for re-election will continue as the stakes in November are high. “Every campaign is important, and every campaign is hard,” the first lady told Vogue for their August cover story. “Each campaign is unique. But this one, the urgency is different. We know what’s at stake. Joe is asking the American people to come together to draw a line in the sand against all this vitriol.” That urgency is something the campaign is hoping she'll be able to convey to voters. In a statement to the BBC, the Biden campaign called Mrs Biden an ""effective messenger"" on the campaign trail.  “As a teacher, mom, and grandmother, she’s uniquely positioned to connect with key constituencies across the country and speak to the president’s vision for America,” the statement said.  Still, her steadfast support combined with White House dismissals of media reports that the president is weighing his exit have yet to tamp down growing uncertainty about the Democratic ticket. The fallout has triggered a backlash of Democrats, donors and some lawmakers publicly calling for the president's withdrawal from the race.  ""Joe has been knocked down and counted out his whole life... When he gets counted out, he works harder. And that's what he's doing, but he needs your help,"" she told Michigan supporters on Wednesday.  ""We don't choose our chapter of history, but we can choose who leads us through it,"" she added.  For Mrs Biden, that choice remains her husband. ",2024-07-04 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4w21kznw1o,"Rachel Looker,",2024-07-04 17:10:07,
65,Hezbollah fires 200 rockets and drones into Israel,"The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has launched more than 200 rockets and attack drones into northern Israel, in response to the killing of one of its senior commanders. Israel's military said one of its officers was killed in the barrage, which started a number of fires.  The military also said it had targeted Hezbollah “military structures” and other targets in southern Lebanon in response.  Lebanese media reported that one person was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the town of Houla. The latest barrage, which followed one comprising 100 rockets on Wednesday afternoon, was one of the biggest so far in the nine months of cross-border violence which have raised fears of an all-out war. The Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was one of the most senior figures in the group to have been killed in the conflict. The Israeli military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah’s Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a “large number of terror attacks”. It also described him as “the counterpart” of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of another unit whose killing last month prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 200 rockets and missiles into northern Israel in a single day. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. So far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, and 25 people in Israel, mostly soldiers. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to restore security in northern Israel. ""In the tough campaign against Lebanon we have set a principle - whoever harms us is a dead man. We are making that a reality in practice,"" he said on Thursday. The hostilities have also displaced tens of thousands of people from border communities in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. “The response to the assassination of the dear leader Hajj Abu Nimah [Nasser]... started last night and quickly,"" senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned at Nasser’s funeral in Beirut on Thursday. “This series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit.” A spokeswoman for the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said the exchanges were now extending deeper into both sides of the border, and called on both Israel and Hezbollah to show restraint. “We're very concerned... because any exchange, any incident, can escalate into something greater if there is a misunderstanding,” Kandice Ardiel told the BBC. There has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions in recent weeks, with the UN and US warning of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a war that could also draw in Iran and other allied groups. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are ready for a war if diplomacy fails. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that the military would soon be ready to “take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength”. Hezbollah, which is seen as a significantly superior foe to Hamas, has said it does not want a full-out war with Israel and that it will observe in Lebanon any ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But it has also warned Israel that it would fight “without rules” if there was a war.",2024-07-04 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw9y7wqn8j5o,"David Gritten,",2024-07-04 19:10:07,
66,US man jailed in Russia for 12 years on drug charges,"A US citizen has been sentenced to 12.5 years at a maximum security penal colony by a Russian court after being convicted on drugs charges.  Robert Woodland, 32, was detained in Moscow in January and accused by prosecutors of seeking to sell a large quantity of methadone. His lawyer told the Reuters news agency that he had partially confessed to the charges. Mr Woodland, who was born in Russia and adopted when he was two, had travelled to the country in 2020 to find his birth mother. His journey was documented by a Russian reality TV programme. He is the latest US citizen to be imprisoned in the country, with some Western officials suggesting the Kremlin is ""hoarding"" Americans to trade for allies and operatives imprisoned abroad.  In a statement released after Mr Woodland's conviction on Thursday, Russian prosecutors said he had been caught while packaging a large quantity of narcotics at an apartment in the Russian capital.  They claimed he had been working with a large-scale criminal group and had transported 50-grams of the drug from a pick-up point outside the city.  His lawyer, Stanislav Kshevitsky, had initially denied the charges, saying officials had presented ""no evidence"" of drug sales before the court.  But he told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Mr Woodland had confessed to some of the allegations against him. It remains unclear which charges he has accepted.  Footage carried by state media in Russia showed Mr Woodland sitting inside a glass cage in court, staring impassively ahead as the verdict against him was read out.  Russian media reported that Mr Woodland decided to remain in the country after meeting his mother in 2020 and worked as an English teacher near Moscow. His tearful reunion with his mother was broadcast on state television at the time.  The Interfax news agency said he holds US and Russian citizenship.  At least a dozen US nationals, including journalists and active duty soldiers, are currently being held in Russian prisons and penal colonies.  Among those is Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained over a year ago on espionage charges which he denies. The US considers him to be ""wrongfully detained"". Western officials have long suspected that Moscow is seeking to detain Western citizens to use as bargaining chips in prisoner swaps. US law prohibits the payment of ransoms to terror groups, but successive administrations have been willing to offer concessions to other states to secure the release of Americans.  This is what happened to Brittney Griner, who was released at the end of 2022 in a prisoner swap with the US in return for the controversial Russian arms dealer Victor Bout. While the US state department said earlier this year that it was aware of Mr Woodland's case, it avoided commenting directly on the allegations.  Instead, it issued a statement saying it “has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas"". US officials have repeatedly warned US citizens in Russia to leave the country, citing the risk of wrongful arrest and harassment by authorities.

69,President’s daughter posts kiss with woman in country where gay sex is banned,"The daughter of Cameroon's president has shared an image in which she is kissing another woman, sparking mixed reactions in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal. The Instagram post shows 26-year-old Brenda Biya embracing Brazillian model Layyons Valença. ""I’m crazy about you & I want the world to know,” Ms Biya wrote, adding a love heart emoji. Her 91-year-old father, Paul Biya, became Cameroon's president in 1982 and is one of Africa's longest-ruling leaders. Those engaging in same-sex acts or relationships in the Central African nation face up to five years in jail.  Ms Biya - a musician based abroad who goes by the name King Nasty - did not explicitly state her sexuality when posting the picture of the kiss. However, some time after the image was published, Ms Biya shared an article from Le Monde, in which the French newspaper reported that she had ""come out"". She also shared other messages from people expressing their support for her. Transgender Cameroonian activist Shakiro was among those who praised Ms Biya, saying her Instagram post could be a ""turning point for the LGBTQ+ community in Cameroon"". Shakiro said Ms Biya “is now positioning herself as a voice for social change in a country where taboos are deeply rooted"".  Shakiro currently resides in Belgium. She sought asylum there after being convicted of “attempted homosexuality” in Cameroon. Although Ms Biya has been praised by some, several social media users in Cameroon responded to her post with homophobic comments.  Some have speculated whether Ms Biya shared the picture in order to generate a buzz, given her reputation for publishing social media posts that spark controversy among Cameroonians. There have also been questions about whether coming out is a privilege that can only be enjoyed by a select few in the country. “I love this for Cameroon’s First Daughter,” LGBT activist Bandy Kiki said in a Facebook post. “However, it highlights a harsh reality: Anti-LGBT laws in Cameroon disproportionately target the poor. Wealth and connections create a shield for some, while others face severe consequences.” Human rights groups have previously criticised Cameroon’s strict laws against members of the LGBT community. In 2022, Human Rights Watch urged Cameroon to “take urgent action to revoke this discriminatory law and to ensure that the human rights of all Cameroonians, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics, are upheld”. Barrister Alice Nkom, a renowned human rights lawyer who defends LGBT people in Cameroon, said Ms Biya was a ""model of courage"" who is “sending an important universal message of love"". Most media outlets in Cameroon have not reported on Ms Biya's recent picture. The media regulatory body has been known to sanction publications and broadcasters for depictions of homosexuality. The government - and President Biya himself - have not officially commented on the story either. The BBC has contacted Ms Biya and is yet to receive a response.

70,How record-breaking Hurricane Beryl is a sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 11:10:10,

72,Groenewegen wins Tour stage six in photo finish,"Dylan Groenewegen claimed his sixth stage win on the Tour de France Dutch rider Dylan Groenewegen clinched victory in a thrilling photo finish to win stage six of the Tour de France. The flat 163.5km route from Macon to Dijon was always likely to end in a bunch sprint, following Mark Cavendish's record-breaking victory a day earlier. But the British rider, 39, finished out of contention in Thursday's sprint and was unable to add to Wednesday's 35th stage win on the Tour, which took him clear of Eddy Merckx for the outright record. Team Jayco–AlUla's Groenewegen, 31, made a late surge for the line to beat Jasper Philipsen by little more than a wheel trim. That gave Groenewegen the sixth stage win of his career and his first since 2022, his first year with his Australian team. Alpecin-Deceuninck's Philipsen was later relegated to 107th place for shifting his line and blocking Wout van Aert during the the final 150m. There was no change at the top of the general classification standings so Tadej Pogacar remains the leader, 45 seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard five seconds further adrift in third. Dylan Groenewegen (furthest right) lunged for the line to beat Jasper Philipsen (furthest left) Astana Qazaqstan's sporting director Mark Renshaw said after Cavendish's win on Wednesday that coming into this year's Tour, which is expected to be the Manx Missile's last, the team felt that Thursday's stage would be his best opportunity to clinch the record. Having sealed the deal on stage five, it means Cavendish now has the chance to increase his record before finally calling it quits. With just one climb on the stage, it promised to be a relatively straightforward ride through the vineyards of Burgundy, and so it proved for the most part. Cavendish did show some frustration after the first of two stoppages because of mechanical issues, but he managed to safely rejoin the peloton long before it picked up the pace rolling into Dijon. He was well placed before the Uno-X Mobility team hit the front but Astana started to fall back with less than 2km remaining and, as the race entered the 800m dash to the line, Cavendish had drifted out of contention. Mathieu van der Poel led out team-mate Philipsen, who then hit the front before Groenewegen - sporting sunglasses that feature an aerodynamic beak - and stage three winner Biniam Girmay came back at the Belgian. Philipsen looked to have held them off but it needed a photo to split them, which showed that Groenewegen had timed his lunge for the line to perfection to win it by little more than the width of his wheel trim. Philipsen was later penalised for forcing Van Aert to slow down as they raced along the barriers. The race continues on Friday with an individual time trial over 25.3km from Nuits-Saint-Georges to Gevrey-Chambertin. 1. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/Team Jayco-AlUla) 3hrs 31mins 55secs 2.

73,Verstappen & Norris 'both happy to race' after clash,"Max Verstappen took victory at last year's British Grand Prix with Lando Norris finishing second and Lewis Hamilton in third place Max Verstappen says he and Lando Norris ""agreed with 99% of everything"" when they discussed their Austrian Grand Prix clash this week. The pair, who collided while fighting for the lead at the Red Bull Ring on Sunday, resume battle at the British Grand Prix this weekend. Verstappen revealed he ""cared about maintaining his relationship"" with Norris because ""we are great friends"". During their talk this week, the world champion said he told the McLaren driver they could trust each other when racing closely. Verstappen added: ""We go at it flat out - that's what we agreed. That's what we like to do and that's what's good for F1 as well."" Briton Norris said: ""It's clear how he races. It's tough, it's on the limit, it's what I love. I thoroughly enjoyed the fight I had with him. ""The more I've thought about it, the more I think it's just racing. It was good racing, very close to the edge at times. We've spoken about it and we are both happy to go racing again."" Their battle ended when they touched while Norris was trying to overtake Verstappen around the outside and both suffered punctures, a collision for which the Dutchman was given a 10-second penalty. Verstappen recovered to finish fifth while the damage caused to Norris' McLaren forced the 24-year-old's retirement. Norris on 'nerve-wracking' battle with Verstappen and confidence in McLaren British teenager Bearman joins Haas for 2025 How to follow British Grand Prix on the BBC Verstappen said: ""The only thing I cared about was maintaining my relationship with Lando because we are great friends and thats' why I said after the race we had to let things cool down because emotions run high. ""We spoke on Monday and we came to the conclusion that we actually really enjoyed our battle. ""We like to race hard. We have done this for many years not only in F1, like online racing where we had a lot of fun together, and these things have to carry on because that's what we like to do and it's great for F1."" Verstappen added he had reassured Norris about his intentions when they are racing. ""I always said to Lando, 'When you go for moves up the inside or outside, you can trust me that I am not there to try and crash you out of the way'. Same the other way around because we spoke about that as well."" Verstappen leads Norris in the drivers' championship by 81 points  Norris had accused Verstappen of changing his line in the braking zone, which is forbidden in F1, and the Dutchman acknowledged indirectly that had been the case. ""Naturally, there is always a human reaction when someone dives down the inside or outside that you have a bit of a reaction to it,"" said Verstappen. ""But I felt everything I did was nothing massively over the top. ""Of course, like how you design a car, you try to go to the edge of the rules, maybe you find some grey areas here and there, and that's the same how you race because otherwise you will never be a top driver or succeed in life anyway."" Norris, who trails Verstappen in the drivers' championship by 81 points, added: ""Max isn't going to want to crash and ruin his own chances. I don't think he's going to change too much, and I don't think I need to change much. ""There are things from both sides we probably wanted to do better. But avoiding an incident from moving under braking is probably the biggest thing. ""The stewards need to be aware that something can easily go wrong. You're defending and that's fine, but at some point that has a limit and it needs to be imposed."" Asked if they could remain friends if their battles continued for a long time, Verstappen said: ""I think so. It also depends on your personalities. Lando is a great guy, a really nice person, who loves F1 and racing and is very passionate about it. ""You also have to realise that he is fighting for his second win, I am fighting for my 62nd, so your emotions are a little bit different. I know that from myself, when I was fighting for my first wins, that’s what I also said, 'Let's let it cool off'."" Another issue to arise from Austria was that Norris earned a five-second penalty for going off track while trying to pass Verstappen, despite immediately giving the place back, because it was conflated with a warning he had previously been given for exceeding track limits. Norris himself and Williams driver Alex Albon both said that decision was ""silly"". Verstappen admitted it was ""a bit of an odd one"". He said Red Bull have an upgrade on their car this weekend, but that he expected the battle to be close on track with McLaren. Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri said he expected Verstappen to be ""really tough to beat"" because of his car's strengths in the sort of high-speed corners that abound at Silverstone.

74,Murray thanks Wimbledon for 'emotional' farewell celebration,"This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Andy Murray thanked Wimbledon organisers for an ""emotional"" farewell ceremony after his final appearance began with a defeat alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. The two-time singles champion is playing at the All England Club for the last time before retiring later this year. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation with elongated applause. ""It feels like a good ending to me. Whether I deserve it or not, I don't know. But they did a really, really good job,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016. The Murray brothers arrived on a packed Centre Court to a standing ovation. Another followed moments after they lost 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 to Australian pair John Peers and Rinky Hijikata. Murray's parents Judy and Will, his wife Kim and two of their daughters watched on as former BBC presenter Sue Barker conducted a poignant ceremony shortly after. Murray thanked his family, his team members over the years and the fans for their continued support. ""It is hard because I want to keep playing, but I can't,"" Murray said on court. ""Physically it's too tough now. I want to play forever. I love the sport."" This video can not be played Andy Murray looks back on his career with Sue Barker Fellow Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic, Martina Navratilova, John McEnroe and Iga Swiatek applauded from the side of the court, alongside British players Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie. Murray is set to appear again later this week, having signed up to the mixed doubles with fellow British Grand Slam champion Emma Raducanu. ""It was obviously very special to play with Jamie, we've not the chance to do it before,"" Murray, who won the first of his three major titles at the 2012 US Open, said. ""It was a race against time to get out here and physically it wasn't easy but I'm glad we were able to do it one time together."" Wimbledon has been the scene of many of the defining moments of Murray's career and the emotional ties are why he fought so hard to play one final time. Murray's chances of a last hurrah had been thrown into serious doubt. A back issue caused a loss of power and feeling in his right leg during a match at Queen's three weeks ago. The only option was an operation on 22 June to remove a cyst close to his spine, but it left Murray in a race against time to be fit. Ultimately, having left making a decision until the night before his scheduled singles match on Tuesday, he realised with a heavy heart it was not possible to play a five-set match. Going out alongside 38-year-old Jamie in the shorter doubles format was the next best thing. The plan, which was initially put in place around the French Open in late May, did come to fruition. Not since 1995 had a men's doubles first-round match been put on Centre Court. This occasion could not have been scheduled anywhere else. Murray reached his first Wimbledon final in 2012, losing to Roger Federer in an four-set match which left him in tears and changed public perception about him. Redemption came when he won Olympic singles gold on the same court against the same opponent four weeks later. A year on, Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's singles champion by beating world number one Djokovic in a moment of national celebration. Another triumph at the All England Club came in 2016, which he says he enjoyed more. After both victories, Murray walked back through the marbled corridors of Centre Court - like tradition dictates - and was given a guard of honour before stepping on to the balcony to greet the adoring fans below. The same ceremonial walk was made by Murray again on Thursday night. While Murray had not won the trophy again, it was the only farewell - of sorts - fit for a player who has led British tennis with distinction. This video can not be played Murrays walk out on Centre Court to standing ovation Talk of the Super Murray Bros dominated day four of this year's Championships. The famous Wimbledon queue, where fans camp overnight to grab one of the limited first-come first-served tickets for the following day, grew to a line of 11,000 hopefuls by mid-morning. The Murraynators were there, of course. A group of super-fans, who have travelled the world to watch their hero, slept outside in Wimbledon Park and were rewarded with Centre Court tickets. If you weren't there with a tent and sleeping bag, your alarm had to be set for a time when nightclubs usually kick out. Inside the All England Club, fans not fortunate enough to have a court ticket gathered on Henman Hill - sorry, Murray Mound. Hundreds had been in position all day with picnics and blankets. Back on Centre, supporters took a breather after women's top seed Swiatek wrapped up a straight-set win at about 18:30 BST. Then, the change of stage began. Down came the net and singles posts, replaced by the longer doubles version. A half-hour turnaround allowed the atmosphere to bubble with the Murrays' nearest and dearest taking their seats. Andy's wife Kim was flanked by their daughters, with mum Judy alongside them. Dad Will had travelled down from Scotland to watch. This video can not be played Murray gets Centre Court ovation from Wimbledon greats Andy Murray insisted the brothers were not just playing for show, claiming they had a good chance of winning the match and going far in the tournament. The match did not pan out as they hoped.  It was clear from the third game that the younger Murray sibling was struggling with his movement. His 'will to win' - which has become the epitaph of his tennis career - had not diminished, however. The usual teeth-bearing and fist-pumping was on show. As was the chuntering at his team. Unfortunately, his body was not operating how his mind wanted it to. That's been a recurring theme for the past five and a half years. At the 2019 Australian Open, Murray broke down in a news conference as he said he thought he would have to retire later that year because of a hip injury. No singles player had come back to professional tennis after a resurfacing surgery. Metal-hip Murray not only returned. He returned and won an ATP Tour title later that year. More memorable moments at Grand Slams followed. But he could not regain the level which made him one of the best players of his generation. ""The injuries have been tough, quite significant injuries,"" he said.  ""We've worked extremely hard just to be on the court competing, probably not on the level that any of us wanted but we tried."" This video can not be played Sue-prise!

75,Raducanu and Kartal aim for Wimbledon last 16,"Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal played each other frequently as juniors Former junior rivals Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal will aim to reach the Wimbledon last 16 on Friday when they play their third-round matches. Raducanu is second on Centre Court against Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari. Fellow Briton Kartal, the world number 298, faces second seed Coco Gauff in the final match on Court One. Before Raducanu's tie, there is an attractive match-up between defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz and 29th seed Frances Tiafoe from 13:30 BST. World number one Jannik Sinner closes the programme on Centre against Miomir Kecmanovic.  Wildcard Raducanu, 21, comes into the third round full of confidence after she thoroughly outplayed Elise Mertens on Wednesday, losing just three games in her success. The test against Sakkari is a rematch of their 2021 US Open semi-final which the Briton won 6-1 6-4 on her way to the title. Now ranked 135th as she continues her comeback from multiple surgeries last year, Raducanu reached the Nottingham semi-finals and Eastbourne quarter-finals in the build-up to Wimbledon. ""I have had quite a few matches on grass so I am feeling really good,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It's a match where I can go out and have a swing. ""I have no pressure or expectation to beat someone in the top 10 right now, but of course I believe in myself and I'm confident with the way I am playing.""

The pair regularly played each other at junior level and a clip of a lengthy rally, external from that period has previously gone viral. Kartal's development was checked by injuries before ""a scary few months at the start of the year"" with health issues. She did not expect to be well enough to play at Wimbledon this year and says coming through qualifying was ""the best thing for me"". Kartal told BBC Sport she had ""spent my whole life kind of under the radar a little bit"". On Friday, she steps into the Court One spotlight to play American Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion. ""I think it's what dreams are made of,"" said Kartal. ""I came here as a little kid, when I was six or seven, watching matches. I've got pictures in my house of me and my family on Centre Court, watching Roger Federer and things like that.

81,Pope Francis critic excommunicated by the Vatican,"An Italian archbishop and staunch critic of Pope Francis has been excommunicated by the Vatican, its doctrinal office has said.  Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of schism - meaning he has split from the Catholic Church - after years of fierce disagreement with the pontiff.  The 83-year-old ultra-conservative has previously called on the Pope to resign, accusing him of heresy and criticising his stances on immigration, climate change and same-sex couples. Archbishop Vigano was a senior figure in the Church, serving as papal envoy to Washington from 2011 to 2016.  In 2018 he went into hiding after alleging that the Pope had known about sexual abuse by an American cardinal and failed to act. The Vatican rejected the accusation. Over time, the archbishop became associated with US conspiracy theorists, criticising Covid vaccines and alleging a ""globalist"" and ""anti-Christian"" project by the UN and other groups - both familiar conspiratorial themes. On Friday the Vatican's doctrinal office said his refusal to submit to Pope Francis was clear from his public statements. ""The Most Reverend Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of the reserved delict [violation of the law] of schism,"" the statement said, adding that he had been excommunicated - or banished  from the church. Responding by a post on X, the archbishop linked to the decree that was emailed to him and said: ""What was attributed to me as guilt for my conviction is now put on record, confirming the Catholic Faith that I fully profess."" Archbishop Vigano was charged with schism and denying the pope's legitimacy last month.  At the time, he write on X that he regarded the accusations against him as ""an honour"".  ""I repudiate, reject, and condemn the scandals, errors, and heresies of Jorge Mario Bergoglio,"" he said, using Argentine Pope's given name. Pope Francis has put himself at odds with traditionalist Catholics by making overtures towards the LGBTQ+ community, championing migrant rights and condemning the excesses of capitalism.  Last year, he took action against another ultra-conservative critic, dismissing Bishop Joseph E Strickland of Texas when he refused to resign after an investigation.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84j07d0j92o,"Ian Aikman,",2024-07-05 17:10:27,
80,Gaza hostage posters outside US lawmaker's office vandalised,"Vandals tore down posters of Israeli hostages hung on the wall outside the Capitol Hill office of a Democratic lawmaker on 4 July, his office said on Friday. Congressman Brad Schneider called the vandalism ""a vile act of hate"".  The posters included photos of more than 100 people, eight of them Americans, taken as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.  Capitol police say they are aware of the vandalism incident outside the congressional office and are investigating. Mr Schneider, a pro-Israel Democrat from Illinois, posted a photo on X, formerly Twitter, showing the posters shredded and tossed across the hallway.  ""This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day,"" he wrote.   ""Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.""  The incident comes less than a week after pro-Palestinian protesters held an overnight rally outside Mr  Schneider's Highland Park home in Illinois. The lawmaker said masked demonstrators banged drums, blew horns and screamed antisemitic chants outside his home. Police dispersed the crowd of around 40 protesters after several complaints from neighbours.  ""These actions don't advance peace,"" Mr Schneider said.  ""Instead, they play directly into the hands of Hamas terrorists enabling them to continue to hold hostage not only those they kidnapped from Israel, but all civilians in Gaza as well.""   The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Over 100 were released during a November cease-fire.  At least 38,010 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

79,Keir Starmer: From indie kid to prime minister,"Three years ago Sir Keir Starmer seriously considered quitting as Labour leader. It was 2021 and his party had just lost the Hartlepool by-election to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.  It was the first time Labour had ever lost the seat. Three short years feel like a political lifetime ago now.  Sir Keir has become only the fifth person in British history to take Labour from opposition to power.  His party has gone from a historic thumping at the general election in 2019 – to victory in 2024. The Hartlepool result though, is a reminder that Sir Keir’s journey to Downing Street was far from straightforward. In fact, for a long time his life and career were on a very different path. Keir Starmer, one of four children, was brought up in the town of Oxted on the Kent-Surrey border. He was raised by his toolmaker father and nurse mother, who suffered from a debilitating form of arthritis known as Still’s disease. Sir Keir has spoken about the challenges of growing up at a time of high inflation in the 1970s. “If you’re working class, you’re scared of debt,” he said during the election campaign.  “My mum and dad were scared of debt, so they would choose the bill that they wouldn’t pay.” The choice was the phone bill. Sir Keir had a lot going on in his younger years.  He was obsessed with football (on the centre-left of midfield, of course). He was a talented musician and learnt violin with Norman Cook, who went on to become chart-topping DJ Fatboy Slim. Sir Keir also had a rebellious streak. He and his friends were once caught by police illegally selling ice-cream on a French beach to raise cash. But what about politics? There were always clues, including his name which was given to him as a tribute to the first leader of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie.  Sir Keir dabbled in left-wing politics over the course of his pre-parliamentary life.  That started at school, when he joined the Young Socialists, Labour’s youth movement. After school, Sir Keir became the first person in his family to go to university, studying law at Leeds University and later at Oxford.  At Leeds, he was influenced by the indie music of the 1980s, from The Smiths and The Wedding Present to Orange Juice and Aztec Camera. His biographer, Tom Baldwin, notes his favourite drink as a student was a mix of beer and cider - or Snakebite - and he had a taste for curry and chips. For a while after graduating, Sir Keir lived above a brothel in north London. More importantly, he was building a reputation as a workaholic that would see him go on to become a successful and prominent human rights lawyer. At the same time, Sir Keir continued his left-wing activism, as a prominent contributor to the magazine Socialist Lawyer.  But politics was a side interest and, for much of the next 20 years, his legal career was his focus. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions, the chief prosecutor for England and Wales. Sir Keir likes to talk about this period in life as an example of his dedication to public service, and often recalls his role in prosecuting terrorist gangs. But what else? Under the 2010-15 coalition government, he had to implement significant cuts, with the Crown Prosecution Service’s budget reduced by more than a quarter. He also oversaw high-profile decisions including the prosecution of MPs over their parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal and prosecuting the then Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne for asking his wife to take speeding points for him. Sir Keir's legal work was rewarded with a knighthood in 2014. But how successful was his leadership?  Towards the end of his tenure, Sir Keir admitted in a BBC interview that vulnerable victims were still being let down by the justice system. It wasn't until the age of 52 that the career change came.  Sir Keir was selected for a safe Labour seat in north London, winning comfortably. He and his predecessor Rishi Sunak became MPs on the same day. But it wasn’t a happy time for the Labour Party.  The Conservatives had just won the general election and a bitter factional battle loomed after Jeremy Corbyn became leader. Much has been said and written about Sir Keir’s journey from backbencher to the Labour leadership – and now to Downing Street. But some things are worth highlighting. When he became leader, Jeremy Corbyn made Sir Keir shadow immigration minister but it didn’t last long.  He resigned after less than a year, one of dozens of frontbenchers who quit after the Brexit referendum in an attempt to force Mr Corbyn out. When that failed, and Mr Corbyn saw off a leadership challenge, Sir Keir returned to the fold as shadow Brexit secretary. Sir Keir’s position on Mr Corbyn has evolved over time.  In 2019, he was asked on BBC Breakfast to repeat the sentence “Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister”. He did.  A few months later, he would tell the BBC he was “100%” behind Mr Corbyn and working with him to win a general election.  While others refused to serve under Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir stayed in the tent and helped persuade the leader to back a second Brexit referendum at the 2019 election. That election was a disaster for Labour. Mr Corbyn quit and Sir Keir won the race to replace him.  But when he took over, a lot of people thought Boris Johnson was destined to govern for some time.  Many saw Sir Keir as a leader who could help rebuild – but few thought he was the man who would take them back to power. When did that change? The polls give us a good indication.  Sir Keir’s Labour trailed Mr Johnson’s Conservatives in the polls for much of 2020 and 2021 when the Hartlepool by-election was held.  But that started to change after the first reports of Downing Street parties during the pandemic, when strict restrictions were in place around social gatherings. There is a clear point in the polls where Labour overtakes the Conservatives in November 2021.  Its lead increased significantly after the Liz Truss mini budget and has been consistent and significant ever since. Sir Keir’s allies argue that wouldn’t have happened without big changes in the Labour Party. Sir Keir has sometimes been ruthless.  Jeremy Corbyn was thrown out of the parliamentary party and ultimately barred from standing as a Labour candidate.  Economic policy was tightened; meaning policies were junked if they weren’t seen as affordable.  Sir Keir embraced British patriotism, using the union jack as a backdrop for speeches and getting his conference to sing God Save the King. All of that has contributed to Sir Keir’s message of change. He spent the campaign arguing he had changed Labour and could change the country too. The election result will also mean change for the Starmer family.  Sir Keir, now 61, married his wife Victoria in 2007. Her intention is to keep working for the NHS in occupational health as he serves as prime minister.  Lady Starmer has been seen at some high-profile events like conference speeches, a rally last week – and at a Taylor Swift gig. But she is unlikely to play as prominent a role in public life as some partners have in the past. Sir Keir though has been candid about the impact high office could have, particularly on his teenage son and daughter.  He told the BBC in 2021: “I am worried about my children. That is probably the single thing that does keep me awake – as to how we will protect them through this.” It’s a challenge the Starmers will now face as they move into Downing Street at the end of a testing, far from straightforward, journey.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4y9evzzppo,"Nick Eardley,",2024-07-05 12:10:27,
76,Biden vows to stay in race and beat Trump in defiant speech,"US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course in his re-election bid and defeat Donald Trump in a defiant speech on Friday, as questions continue to swirl over whether he will drop out of the race. At a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the 81-year-old acknowledged his disastrous performance in last week's CNN debate. ""Ever since then, there’s been a lot of speculation. What’s Joe going to do?” he told the crowd. “Here’s my answer. I am running and going to win again,” Mr Biden said, as supporters in the crucial battleground state cheered his name. It marked his latest commitment to staying in the race as he seeks to defuse a political crisis that has snowballed in recent days. The 17-minute speech, which was more energetic than his widely-panned performance on the debate stage, comes at a critical moment for his campaign, with donors and Democratic allies considering whether to stick with him. The campaign recognises that the next few days could make or break his re-election bid, according to various reports in US media, as Mr Biden seeks to regain ground that he lost to his Republican rival Donald Trump following the debate. After his speech in Madison, a rare sit-down interview will air on ABC News at 20:00 EDT which will also be closely watched by those questioning his commitment and fitness. As he took the stage at the rally, Mr Biden passed one voter who was holding a sign reading ""Pass the torch, Joe"". Another voter who stood outside the venue held a sign that read ""Save your legacy, drop out!"". ""I see all these stories that say I'm too old,"" Mr Biden said at the rally, before triumphing his record in the White House. ""Was I too old to create 15 million jobs?"" he said. ""Was I too old to erase student debt for five million Americans?"" “Do you think I’m too old to beat Donald Trump?"" he asked, as the crowd responded ""no"". Referencing Trump's criminal conviction in New York, and the other charges he is facing in separate cases, he called his rival a ""one-man crime wave"". Pressure on Mr Biden to step aside has only grown following the debate which was marked by several instances where he lost his train of thought, raising concerns about his age and mental fitness. His campaign is planning an aggressive come-back. His wife, Jill Biden, as well as Vice-President Kamala Harris, are planning a campaign blitz to travel to every battleground swing state this month.  Mr Biden, who is due to speak at another rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked the vice-president for her support. She has emerged as the most likely candidate to replace him on the Democratic ticket if he were to step down. On Thursday, Mr Biden acknowledged that he ""screwed up"" in the debate. He has blamed jet lag for his poor performance, saying that his busy travel schedule prevented him from getting sufficient rest before the debate. ""I didn’t listen to my staff... and then I nearly fell asleep on stage,” he said. The Washington Post has reported that Mr Biden's senior team are aware of the pressure coming from within the Democratic Party to make a decision on the future of his candidacy within the next week.  Three Democrats in the House of Representatives in Congress have now called for him to withdraw from the race - Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Raúl Grijalva of Arizona and Seth Boulton of Massachusetts.  “President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington’s footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,” Mr Moulton told radio station WBUR on Thursday. However, no senior Democrats have called on him to quit, as his campaign has pointed out to reporters. On Friday, reports emerged that Senator Mark Warner was attempting to form a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Mr Biden to drop out of the race. The reports, including one in the Washington Post, suggested Mr Warner had deep concerns following the CNN debate. At the rally in Madison, multiple Biden supporters told BBC News that they supported his bid for re-election and were not concerned about the debate debacle. ""I’m not worried about his health. I think he can go all the way to the election and beyond,"" said primary school teacher Susan Shotliff, 56. Some said that while Mr Biden struggled for words, more focus should be on his Republican rival. ""During the debate, [Trump] told a bunch of lies. How is that any worse than what Biden did?"" said Greg Hovel, 67. Others expressed more concern. ""I wanted to have a first hand look at how he’s like, his mannerisms, his energy,"" said Thomas Leffler, a health researcher from Madison. ""I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump."" ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl5y8n5d09qo,"Mike Wendling in Madison, Wisconsin & Max Matza,",2024-07-05 21:10:27,
77,Hungary's Russia-friendly PM meets Putin in Moscow,"Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, in a visit that has been heavily criticised by EU leaders and Ukraine's government.  Friday's meeting was part of what Mr Orban called a ""peace mission"", coming three days  after a visit to Kyiv where he met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hungary has just taken over the presidency of the Council of the European Union, but EU leaders have stressed that Mr Orban is not acting on behalf of the bloc.  Mr Orban is the EU's only head of government to have kept close ties to the Kremlin following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After the meeting, which lasted several hours, Hungary's PM said Russia and Ukraine were still ""far apart"" in their views on achieving peace.  ""Many steps are needed to end the war, but we took the first step to restore dialogue,"" he said.  The Russian leader called it a ""frank and useful"" conversation. He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy. Volodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Earlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting ""not just as a long-time partner"" but as a European Union representative.  However, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU.  ""The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU,"" Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X.  ""The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine."" ""Appeasement will not stop Putin,"" European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. Ukraine also condemned the visit: ""For our country, the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all states to strictly adhere to it,"" the foreign ministry said a statement.  Earlier this week, Mr Orban visited Kyiv, saying ""a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations"". President Zelensky - who has had frosty relations with Mr Orban - did not publicly respond to the proposal.  Ahead of Ukraine’s offensive last summer, Mr Orban warned that Ukraine cannot win on the battlefield.  Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Hungarian prime minister has underlined that Russia’s advantage in resources and men makes Putin’s country unbeatable.  However, many Ukrainians believe any ceasefire would simply cement Russia’s hold over territory it has seized from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot. Mr Orban has been a vocal critic of Western support for Ukraine. He previously slowed agreement on a €50bn ($54bn; £42bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia. Tuesday's visit to Kyiv was his first in 12 years, while he met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time. During Mr Orban's joint appearance with Mr Zelensky, the body language between them was not warm, and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements. But for the next six months Mr Orban's position as head of the Council of the European Union means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe.  His visit to Kyiv came on his second day in that role, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml29r8d2zxo,"Jaroslav Lukiv and Nick Thorpe,",2024-07-05 16:10:27,

78,'Breakthrough' heightens hopes of Gaza ceasefire deal,"The head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, David Barnea, is reported to have travelled alone to Doha to meet Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani as momentum is again building over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. This appears to be very much a preliminary move in what could once again be a complicated series of discussions aimed at finally bridging the gap between the Israeli government and Hamas over what each defines as its bottom line in what any potential deal would comprise. After Mr Barnea left Doha, the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said gaps still remained between the two sides. Israeli officials had already said that expectations need to be lowered. The latest rekindling of hope for a deal came after Hamas delivered its response to the three-phase proposal that President Biden set out several weeks ago.   The key to that formulation was to put off what has long appeared to be the main obstacle in either side accepting a deal - the demand by Hamas that there must be a permanent ceasefire and the counter-demand by Israel that it must have the freedom to resume fighting in Gaza if necessary. Exactly what Hamas has presented has not yet been made public.  But the Israeli response appears far more positive than in other instances in the past seven months when the process has regained momentum.  A source in Israel's negotiating team said that the proposal put forward by Hamas included a ""very significant breakthrough"". There are indications that this could be that Hamas has accepted the key point of the proposal announced by President Biden - that it would allow negotiations to achieve its goal of a permanent end to the war through the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, rather than demanding it as the starting point. Hamas has throughout bridled at its portrayal by the US in particular as the main stumbling block in agreeing a deal.  Should it become clear that it has indeed made this concession, then the ball would be firmly back in the court of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At no time has he personally yielded an inch in his public commitment to the complete eradication of Hamas - and Israel's right to continue fighting in Gaza after any ceasefire.  He has resisted all pressure from inside and outside Israel to modify that stance.  But the pressure has been building on him from all sides, inexorably. The latest push seems to have come from within his own military.  A recent article in the New York Times, citing unnamed current and former security officials, said that Israel's top generals ""want to begin a ceasefire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being"". Mr Netanyahu dismissed this as defeatist.  But he may not be able to resist such pressure forever - nor the ever growing anger on the streets of Israel from those who want the remaining hostages in Gaza to be brought home now. For Hamas, there are also some signs of growing despair over the continuing war by those who suffer from it every day, the civilian population of Gaza.  And internationally, the patience of mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, may be running out.   Regional countries that wholeheartedly support the Palestinian cause have also been reported to be putting increasing pressure on Hamas to accept a deal.  Its leadership may feel that the group's apparent survival, even if severely degraded both politically and militarily, may be victory enough. And for the international community, the need to find some end to the war has grown even more urgent with the spectre of the confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah potentially erupting into all-out war.  A ceasefire in Gaza could potentially ease those tensions. And for the Biden administration - still reeling in the aftermath of last week's debate between the president and Donald Trump - a diplomatic success here would be a much-needed boost. All these elements suggest that the hopes that have once again been raised may this time finally prove more resilient to the negative factors that have seen them dashed before.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyz4y6979o,"Sebastian Usher,",2024-07-05 20:10:27,
90,What's happened in UK election and what comes next?,"Sir Keir Starmer is the UK's new prime minister, after his Labour Party swept to power in a landslide general election victory. The Conservative Party suffered a dramatic collapse after a tumultuous 14 years in power, which saw five different prime ministers run the country. It lost 250 seats over the course of a devastating night.  Rishi Sunak - the outgoing PM - accepted responsibility for the result and apologised to defeated colleagues during a brief statement outside a rainy 10 Downing Street. He said he would resign as party leader in the coming weeks. In his first speech as prime minister after greeting dozens of jubilant Labour supporters who had lined Downing Street, Sir Keir vowed to run a ""government of service"" and to kick start a period of ""national renewal"".  ""For too long we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity,"" he said. ""I want to say very clearly to those people. Not this time.""  ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while, but have no doubt the work of change will begin immediately.""  The result marks a stunning reversal from the 2019 election when Labour, led by the veteran left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, suffered its worst electoral defeat in almost a century.  On the other side, Robert Buckland, a former Conservative minister who lost his seat, described it as ""electoral Armageddon"" for the Tories. It is the party's worst result in almost 200 years, with an ideological battle over its future direction expected ahead.  It's been a long night of results. Here's what it all means. Britain's House of Commons has 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of their ""seats"" represents a constituency, or district. So far Labour has won 412 seats, while the Conservatives have slumped to just 121 and centrist Liberal Democrats have taken 71. Reform UK, a successor to the Brexit Party, is set to pick up four seats, as is the left-wing Green Party.  There is just one seat left to be declared, in Scotland, for the constituency of Skye and Ross-shire.  Labour's surge was partly aided by the collapse of the Scottish National Party (SNP). The party has been hit by a succession of controversies around its finances and fell to just nine seats overnight. The expected 170-seat majority in the House of Commons for Labour is an enormous number but still short of the majority of 179 won by the party under Tony Blair in the 1997 election.  But for more perspective, the Conservatives' win in the 2019 election under Boris Johnson - seen as a very strong performance - saw them get a majority of 80 seats.  A reminder: If a party holds a majority, it means it doesn't need to rely on other parties to pass laws. The bigger the majority, the easier it is. There were, however, a number of notable defeats for Labour to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza tickets - especially in areas with large Muslim populations.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance to the conflict. In February, the party called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but critics said it was too slow to reach that position.  Centre-left parties in other Western countries were keeping a keen eye on the trend ahead of the poll, amid fear of a growing backlash from their own voters over their support for Israel.  As constituencies have declared their results live on television - with all candidates lined up next to each other on stage - there were some major moments. Perhaps the most notable was the defeat of Liz Truss. The former prime minister served just 49 days in Number 10 before being ousted by her party. She narrowly lost to Labour in the constituency of South West Norfolk, having previously held a huge 24,180 majority. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative business secretary and arch-Brexiteer, was another of the biggest names to suffer defeat. He lost his East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour.  He told the BBC that he couldn't ""blame anybody other than myself"" for the loss but he took a ""small silver lining"" from the fact that the Conservatives would be ""at least the official opposition"" - a reference to fears they wouldn't even have that. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, looked rattled after losing his seat in southern England.  Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, who ran against Rishi Sunak for the party leadership before he became prime minister, lost her seat in Portsmouth. As the night wore on, a succession of other Conservative cabinet ministers also lost their seats, including Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer.  But Jeremy Hunt, who served as chancellor - the UK equivalent of a finance minister - held on to his seat but with a much-reduced majority. Mr Sunak also won his seat in Yorkshire with a comfortable majority of about 12,000 -  but used his acceptance speech to concede and confirm his party had lost the election.  Labour lost two big names of their own. Jonathan Ashworth and Thangam Debbonaire were both expected to be a part of Keir Starmer's incoming cabinet.  Things move pretty fast in British politics - there is very little time between an election result and the installation of the new prime minister.  By mid-morning moving vans had arrived to help Rishi Sunak out of 10 Downing Street. He was then whisked away to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.  Then, just 14 hours after the initial exit poll dropped, Sir Keir was formally invited by the monarch to form the next government. Moments later - watched by the world's media - he walked up Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time as prime minster.  He has already started appointing a new cabinet.  Angela Rayner has been made deputy prime minister, while Rachel Reeves has become the first female chancellor.  Meanwhile David Lammy is the new foreign secretary with Yvette Cooper as home secretary. Speaking before he handed his resignation to the King, Mr Sunak wished the new PM well.  ""His successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent public spirited man who I respect.""    He's fairly new to politics, relatively speaking. Sir Keir started his professional life as a barrister in the 1990s, and was appointed the director of public prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, in 2008. He was first elected in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency in north London in 2015, and took over leadership of Labour after the party's poor 2019 general election, pledging to start a ""new era"" after the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir was re-elected in the same constituency on Thursday, saying in his victory speech people were ""ready for change"" and promising an ""end the politics of performance"". ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community, your future,"" he said. ""You have voted. It's now time for us to deliver."" The Labour leader largely avoided making big pledges during the campaign. But during his address outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said his government would strive to ""rebuild"" British public services such as the NHS, slash energy bills and secure the country's border.  ""You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change,"" he vowed.  You can read Sir Keir's full profile here. This election's insurgent party was Reform UK, the right-wing successor to the Brexit Party and the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage, its leader, finally won a seat on his eighth attempt - but his party's initial projection of 13 seats fizzled to four. That's still better than UKIP and the Brexit Party ever did, and Mr Farage has been celebrating. The party's share of the vote looks to be about 14%. Reform drew controversy during the campaign over offensive statements made by some of its candidates and activists.  Mr Farage will be joined in the House of Commons by former Conservative party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, Reform founder Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe. From their new perch in parliament, the party could seek to cause trouble for the Conservatives and pick off more voters from the party's remaining base.

89,Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?,"Three decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of ""fulfilment centres"", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. ""For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',"" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. ""It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,"" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by ""living in a cave"". So the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over ""severe"" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: ""What the heck is left?"" ""Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?"" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to ""keep taking swings"" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a ""whole graveyard of bad ideas"" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention ""in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century"", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. ""Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,"" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziukėnas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. ""It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,"" he says. Amanda Mull points to another priority for Amazon in the years ahead: staving off competition from Chinese rivals like Temu and Shein. Amazon, she says, has ""created the spending habits"" of western consumers by acting as a trusted intermediary between them and Chinese manufacturers, and bolting on to that easy returns and lightening fast delivery. But remove that last element of the deal and you can bring prices down, as the Chinese retailers have done. ""They have said 'well, if you wait a week or 10 days for something that you're just buying on a lark, we can give it to you for almost nothing,'"" says Ms Mull - a proposition that is appealing to many people, especially during a cost of living crisis. Juozas Kaziukėnas is not so sure - suggesting the new retailers will remain ""niche"", and it will take something much more fundamental to challenge Amazon's position. ""For as long as going shopping involves going to a search bar - Amazon has nailed that,"" he says. Thirty years ago a fledging company spotted emerging trends around internet use and realised how it could upend first retail, then much else besides. Mr Kaziukėnas says for that to happen again will take a similar leap of imagination, perhaps around AI. ""The only threat to Amazon is something that doesn't look like Amazon,"" he says.",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5l6vnvqjo,"Tom Singleton,",2024-07-05 12:10:28,

92,US cities can now punish homelessness. Will it help or hurt a crisis?,"""I still have 20 more minutes before I have to move,"" Anthony yelled from his green tent on a Hollywood sidewalk as he heard footsteps approaching. Officials in Los Angeles had come by earlier to warn him that he could face arrest if he didn't move his belongings. They told him about the recent Supreme Court opinion that opened the door for cities and states across the US to punish anyone sleeping outdoors — the most significant ruling on homelessness since at least the 1980s, when many experts say the modern US homeless crisis began. It's added to the lengthy list of worries Anthony says he already has. ""I’m just trying to survive,” he told the BBC while lying down in his tent, using a blue backpack as a pillow. A black trash bag sits inside, filled with what belongings he can carry as he moves from one area to the next. “Some nights I don’t get no sleep,” he said. “I’ve been tired all day. I just want to lay somewhere comfortable and get a good nap in. And that’s it. I am not bothering nobody.” Moments later, Anthony packed up his tent and went looking for a new place to call home. The high court’s ruling is already having a ripple effect on cities across the country, which have been emboldened to take harsher measures to clear out homeless camps that have grown in the aftermath of the pandemic. Many US cities have been wrestling with how to combat the growing crisis. The issue has been at the heart of recent election cycles on the West Coast, where officials have poured record amounts of money into creating shelters and building affordable housing. Leaders face mounting pressure as long-term solutions - from housing and shelters to voluntary treatment services and eviction help - take time. “It’s not easy and it will take a time to put into place solutions that work, so there’s a little bit of political theatre going on here,"" Scout Katovich, an attorney who focuses on these issues for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told the BBC. ""Politicians want to be able to say they’re doing something,” The problem, Ms Katovich and other advocates say, is arresting or fining the homeless will only worsen the problem. “This tactic simply kicks the can down the road. Sure, you might clean up a street but the people you arrest will surely be back.” The high court's ruling last week didn’t mandate how cities and governments should handle homelessness - but it gave communities leeway to take more severe measures without the fear of legal recourse.  The case began in the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, with a population of around 40,000. Over the last 20 years the city doubled in size, but its supply of affordable and public housing did not keep up. Housing prices skyrocketed and the number of homeless grew.  Elected leaders passed laws allowing the city to issue $295 (£230) fines - or 20-day jail sentences for repeat offenses - to unhoused people sleeping or camping in public. Three homeless people sued the city in 2018 after they received multiple citations they were unable to pay.  An appeals court found such laws virtually banned homelessness and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.  The Supreme Court finally ruled that cities were clear to prohibit homeless people sleeping outside in public places.  “A handful of federal judges cannot begin to ‘match’ the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding ‘how best to handle’ a pressing social question like homelessness,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority's opinion.  Theane Evangelis argued this case before the Supreme Court on behalf of Grants Pass.  She says city officials had their hands tied because they could not force anyone into a shelter. She argues those who refuse to use the services offered end up staying in encampments.  “Living in tents is not a compassionate solution, and it's not treating people with dignity. And so the Supreme Court's decision was remarkable in the degree to which it listened to those cities,” she said. Leaders in Grants Pass say they plan to examine the Supreme Court opinion before making a plan on whether to enforce its ban on encampments.  The ruling comes at a critical time for the unhoused.  Last year, the US tracked the highest numbers of homeless people since 2007 - when the US Department of Housing and Urban Development started tracking such data. There were 653,104 homeless people counted as part of the agency's yearly homeless assessment in 2023. That's a nearly 11% increase from the year prior. The ACLU has been tracking the reaction to the decision by city leaders across the US.  It has  already sent a letter to Manchester, New Hampshire, after the mayor promised to ban encampments to “make our streets safe, clear and passable”. Other city leaders, like the mayor in Lancaster, California, have promised to “be much more aggressive” against encampments in neighbourhoods and near stores. Mayor R Rex Parris told the Los Angeles Times “we’re going to be moving them really fast”. State lawmakers in Oregon also seem poised to look at changing laws that will give them greater latitude to rid homeless camps, local media reported. In Spokane, Washington, leaders are asking authorities to dismantle more camps. But fining people who don’t have the means for housing worsens their finances, advocates say.  Arresting them can make it harder to find a job or housing, experts told the BBC. “There is mounds and volumes of evidence showing that having an unpaid citation and a warrant out for arrest, let alone in incarceration, prevents people from accessing housing, jobs in other places,"" Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California in Los Angeles told the BBC.  ""It actually prevents people from accessing shelter.”  Not all cities have welcomed the court decision.  In Los Angeles, the mayor called the  ruling “disappointing” and vowed to continue investing in affordable housing, voluntary treatment and eviction protections. Days after the opinion, the city released a homeless count showing the first drop in nearly six years. Advocates say it is a prime example that other cities can learn from. “Real change takes time,” Sasha Morozov, a regional director for PATH, a leading homeless provider in the Los Angeles area, told the BBC. Ms Morozov noted, though, outreach teams in the greater Los Angeles area are still working to inform those living on the streets about the Supreme Court’s ruling. Teams are also preparing for increased demand for legal services. Around the corner from Anthony, Topher Williams, 28, calls a makeshift tent on a sidewalk home.  Black and blue tarps are tied to tree branches and street parking poles. Plywood boards line the edges of the structure, which he calls a three-room apartment. Mr Williams, who told the BBC he was an Army veteran, has been living on the streets for four years. An unlucky combination of medical expenses and the pandemic's economic struggles left him without a job or shelter. Like Anthony, he’s frustrated at the lack of compassion from city officials and law enforcement. “It's mind blowing the way people look at us. The way people straight up treat us like we're like less than animals. And they have no idea,” he said, tears welling in his eyes. “I served eight years in the military. I did two tours of duty.

86,What went wrong for the Conservatives?,"The Conservative Party had become accustomed to almost being the Manchester City of politics. A blue, winning machine for so long that some of its key players could barely remember anything else. But their streak - that delivered Tory prime ministers in four elections in a row - has been brought to a dramatic end. Many Tories, both winners and losers, are almost speechless and still processing it. One told me they were simply ""not coherent"". A post-mortem on what went wrong with their tactics and leadership, and where to go next, is now beginning. When I speak to Conservatives, several themes come up repeatedly. Some feel Labour's policy offering was not drastically different to theirs, but think the choice became more about perceptions of ""competence"".  They have had five leaders, and prime ministers, in less than 10 years. Seismic events, from Brexit to Covid to multiple leadership contests, splintered the party into ideological factions. Some Tories spent more energy plotting to take each other down than their opposition - and never really patched things up. Scandals rocked the party in a whack-a-mole fashion, from lockdown parties to sexual misconduct allegations to a mini-budget that contributed to raising interest rates. An election betting saga was the cherry on top. When I asked former Chief Whip Sir Mark Spencer during the campaign if the party had a conduct problem, he mentioned that other parties also had to suspend MPs for poor behaviour - which is true - but conceded this had become too regular. Then there was the undoubted desire for change - a word Labour deployed in its campaign. The cost of living, NHS waiting lists, and small boats were all issues voters raised on the doorstep - and felt had been getting worse, not better. Nigel Farage's late return to the fray meant the latter theme became a particular thorn in Tory sides, with some right-leaning voters who switched to Reform UK wanting tougher immigration policies and lower taxes. Rhetoric and policies attempting to win them back alienated some more centrist Tories who abandoned the party for Labour or the Liberal Democrats, leaving the Tories pincered in between. This was a more comfortable switch for some centrists who didn’t feel they could vote Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. Did these circumstances mean defeat was inevitable? Most Tories I've spoken to describe the result as ""not unexpected"", but some feel the scale of it could have been mitigated. There were avoidable gaffes - like Rishi Sunak leaving D-day commemorations early. While Boris Johnson was prone to gaffes too, some of his fans felt Mr Sunak didn’t charm voters back in the same way. The former prime minister still yielded chants of ‘Boris! Boris!’ at an eleventh-hour rally to try to energise the campaign. There is still a lingering bafflement among some about why Mr Sunak decided to call the election in July. Their campaign guru, Isaac Levido, had argued for a later date - hoping by then there would be more ""measurables"" to demonstrate their policies were having an impact. A flight of asylum seekers taking off to Rwanda, for example, or an interest rate cut. But he lost that argument. And the Conservatives had little evidence in their armoury of some of their policies working when they went to the electorate. The risk of the alternative, Mr Levido's critics argued, was that more bad news could come down the road for the Tories - more Channel crossings this summer, more offenders being released because of prison overcrowding, universities going under. But policy and identity wise, what else could the Conservatives have done? That's where their focus will lie now as a search for the soul of the party begins. Mr Sunak has confirmed he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to choose his successor. There have been murmurings for the last few weeks about whether an interim leader is appointed to avoid the awkwardness of, for example, the former PM having to do Prime Minister's Questions from the opposition benches.  Could this be someone who served in the cabinet previously - like Sir Oliver Dowden, James Cleverly, or even Jeremy Hunt, who just about scraped back into the Commons?  If so, it would probably need to be someone who doesn't actually want to run for leader full time. Otherwise, Mr Sunak could stay on until the next Tory leadership contest concludes. There are some MPs who have been working behind the scenes for a long time on shoring up their support, including Kemi Badenoch (the bookies' favourite) who is on the right of the party, and Tom Tugendhat, who is more to the centre.  Former contenders like Suella Braverman and former Sunak ally-turned-critic Robert Jenrick are tipped to run too. They both spent time in the Home Office, are on the right of the party, and have criticised the government's record on immigration. One interesting thing to note, though, is who the remaining Tory MPs are, and what that might mean for who wins support among the parliamentary party. I've had a quick skim over the new intake of Tory MPs and who they backed in the first Tory leadership contest of July-September 2022. Interestingly, the majority are Sunak-backers, with a hefty chunk of Liz Truss supporters too. Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have lost a couple of their key allies on the right of the parliamentary party. A couple of Mr Tugendhat’s backers are gone too. Why do the leanings of the remaining MPs matter? Well, partly because this will determine how the Tory party decides to shape itself going forward. Does it decide to elect someone on the right of the party, like Ms Badenoch, Mrs Braverman or Mr Jenrick, to try to stave off the growing influence of Reform UK who have now won several seats? Some in the party argue not being tougher on issues like immigration was part of their downfall. Or does it try to shift back toward the centre ground with a candidate like Mr Tugendhat or Mr Hunt to reclaim some of the space Labour is now trying to occupy on the political spectrum?  Some in the party argue the Tories' drift to the right was part of the problem, and alienated socially liberal, but fiscally conservative, voters. The answer will be the result of a lot of tussling and soul-searching over the weeks to come.",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng05k1z0eo,"Ione Wells,",2024-07-05 16:10:28,

84,Andrew Tate free to leave Romania but not the EU,"Controversial influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are free to leave Romania but not the EU, a Bucharest court has ruled.  They had previously been banned from leaving the country where they are awaiting trial, indicted on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. They deny all allegations against them.  The decision to allow freedom of movement in the EU is not final and can be appealed. The brothers said the move represented a ""significant victory and major step forward"" in their ongoing case.  The brothers' lawyer, Eugene Vidineac, called the ruling a ""reflection of the exemplary behaviour and assistance of my clients.  ""Andrew and Tristan are still determined to clear their name and reputation; however, they are grateful to the courts for placing this trust in them."" Posting on X, a platform from which he was previously banned, Andrew Tate said: ""The sham case is falling apart."" The Tate brothers, former kickboxers who are dual UK-US nationals, are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the brothers in an indictment published in June last year, and seven alleged victims were identified. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence against him and there is a conspiracy to silence him. The internet personalities are also wanted in the UK over sexual offences allegedly committed there. The brothers have had restrictions on their movement for the past two years.  They were held in police custody during the criminal investigation from late December 2022 until April 2023, before being placed under house arrest until August, when courts put them under judicial control.

Evgenia Kara-Murza said on X that officials refused to comment on his condition when his lawyers tried to visit him. Last year Mr Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-British citizen, was jailed and transferred to a prison colony in Siberia. His wife says he suffers from a neurological condition as a result of poisonings. Mr Kara-Murza, 42, has accused Russian authorities of trying to poison him in 2015 and 2017. On Friday, lawyers for the dissident arrived at the Omsk prison colony but were not told where he was for five hours and then not permitted to visit him in hospital, Evgenia Kara-Murza says.  The outspoken critic of the Kremlin was arrested in April 2022. In 2023 he was sentenced to 25 years for spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". He has criticised President Vladimir Putin over the Russian government's crackdown on dissent and the war in Ukraine. He had also played a key role in persuading Western governments to sanction Russian officials for human rights abuses and corruption. The US state department has described Mr Kara-Murza as ""yet another target of the Russian government's escalating campaign of repression"". Mr Kara-Murza, who comes from a Soviet dissident family, received British citizenship when he moved to the UK as a teenager with his mother. His wife has expressed concern over his wellbeing while in prison, particularly following the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny earlier this year.

87,Sunak's 'dismal end' and 'bland' Starmer: World media reacts to UK election,"By BBC Monitoring and Matthew Davis The Conservatives have emerged with ""broken bones"" from the UK election after Rishi Sunak's ""dismal end"" - but the big question for some in the international media is whether the ""bland, even boring"" Keir Starmer can clean up the UK's ""mess"". Labour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time.  For Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean ""the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders"", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile. Voters ""were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,"" the paper says, adding that ""Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party"". German business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result ""opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit"". ""Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,"" the paper said. Mr Farage’s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an “election earthquake”, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives. French media largely hails Labour’s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader’s success in Clacton, ""the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader"". According to Le Monde, the UK’s return to the centre-left is ""striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections"". Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: ""The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced."" Conservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer “a reassuring institutional alternative”. But for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as “a bit bland, even boring”. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, “previous leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results”. In Hungary, the press there noted two issues: “Unchanged support for Ukraine”, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for “a more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,” said the left-wing paper Telex.  The New York Times casts Labour's victory as ""a seismic moment in the UK’s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s"". But it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots. ""The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters’ faith in mainstream politics,"" the Times says. For ABC News, Rishi Sunak’s campaign to remain Britain’s prime minister showed a lack of political touch. ""Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters."" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May — ""with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,"" the broadcaster said. Meanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: ""The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos."" ""Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,"" the paper said. By Rupsha Mukherjee  Most TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat.  “British Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,” The Times of India noted. The Wire website called it ""a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government"". Everything Sunak tried during the campaign “really failed”, Times Now TV added. “Everyone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat."" But the Labour win “is also a triumph for India”, one news site thought, suggesting that Sir Keir Starmer would seek better relations with Delhi. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring China team China’s only official statement so far has been via its foreign ministry, which said China “had noticed the results of the British election” and “we hope to get Sino-UK relations along the right track”. Despite these hopes, state media outlets were not overly optimistic.  “With six prime ministers in eight years, can Starmer clean up the UK’s mess?” asked broadcaster CCTV. Given the next government faces “the most challenging issues in 70 years”,  “public dissatisfaction” might soon follow, mused The Paper.  The Global Times, however, published a positive profile of the prime minister-to-be, saying Sir Keir was “not the inflammatory politician that people imagine”, and that media impressions of him are that he is “conscientious, good at management, and a little dull”.  China can hope for a more pragmatic relationship with the UK, the paper said. By Anastasia Bazenkova and Yuriy Martynenko Russia’s state-controlled TV channels have presented the UK election result as a “miserable failure” and a ""crushing defeat"" for the Conservative party and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. State channel Rossiya 1 said that Brexit was the only achievement of 14 years of Conservative rule and Channel One objected to how Russia had been cast in the election in the UK, which has helped rally Western opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.  “This election, like politics in general in Britain in recent years, just can’t manage without an enemy figure in the form of Russia,"" the channel said. Outlets and commentators in both Russia and Ukraine don't expect the election to change UK policies toward Russia. “For Moscow [Keir Starmer's] arrival in power changes nothing, since he takes anti-Russian positions and supports continued backing for Ukraine,” said NTV, another leading Russian channel. Pro-government paper Izvestiya thought anyway that: “Political changes in Europe show that for the electorate, internal issues are becoming much more important than Ukraine.” In Ukraine, the country’s national wartime news service Suspilne thought the same. ""For the first time in 14 years, power will change hands in the UK, but this will not have an impact on support for Ukraine,"" the news service said.

94,Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?,"US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing. Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics.  Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead. Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn. Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft"".  The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by. Mr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project.  “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,"" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery.  On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. “It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.” However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. “It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.” Regulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft. Mr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. “The FAA has always been super risk averse. That’s their business!” Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he’s put  “my entire adult life” into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business. Mr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board. Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%. But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment. The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier. “Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says. Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat"". And, if the flying piano can surf, then who knows what's possible?",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kk4lxe702o,"Michael Dempsey,",2024-07-04 23:10:29,
95,Israel settlements drive heightens Palestinian land angst,"Palestinian officials have condemned a dramatic new settlement drive by Israel in the occupied West Bank which includes retroactively authorising three outposts. The move is set to further stoke tensions in the territory which has seen a surge in violence since the war in Gaza began on 7 October. Palestinians claim the West Bank as part of their hoped-for future state.  Settlements are widely seen as illegal under international law although Israel disagrees. The three unauthorised outposts that have now been legalised under Israeli law were described as new neighbourhoods of existing settlements.  They are in sensitive areas in the Jordan Valley and near the southern city of Hebron. In addition, the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said on Thursday that Israeli authorities had approved or advanced plans for 5,295 homes in dozens of settlements. It also emerged this week that the Israeli government’s Higher Planning Council had approved the largest seizure of West Bank land in over three decades. Some 12,700 dunams (5 sq miles) has been seized in the Jordan Valley and declared as Israeli state land. This year has marked a peak in the extent of declarations of state land with a total of 23,700 dunams affected. The Palestinian president’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdeinah, said the new announcements confirmed that Israel’s “extremist government is bound by the right-wing policy of war and settlement”.  He said the latest steps would not “achieve security and peace for anyone” and were meant to prevent the establishment of a geographically contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. Last week, Israel’s security cabinet decided to authorise retroactively five settlement outposts built without official government approval. The UN, the UK and other countries denounced the move as undermining hopes for the two-state solution - the internationally approved formula for peace that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. “Israel must halt its illegal settlement expansion and hold to account those responsible for extremist settler violence,” the British Foreign Office said. “The UK’s priority is to bring the Gaza conflict to a sustainable end as quickly as possible and ensure a lasting peace in the Middle East, through an irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution.” The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the overall strategy for the West Bank. However, the far-right Israeli minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, has welcomed the recent steps. ""We are building the good land and thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state,"" he said Wednesday on social media platform X. Not counting annexed east Jerusalem, about half a million settlers live in the West Bank alongside three million Palestinians. Last year, Mr Smotrich instructed government departments to prepare to double the number of settlers to one million. Since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, successive Israeli administrations have allowed settlements to grow.  However, expansion has risen sharply since Mr Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a hardline, pro-settler governing coalition. Last month, Peace Now released the recording of an address by Mr Smotrich to his Religious Zionism party, in which he proposes transferring the management of settlements from military to civilian officials, building a separate road bypass system for settlers,  expanding farming outposts and cracking down on unauthorised Palestinian construction. Peace Now warned that the plan would irreversibly change the way the West Bank was governed and lead to “de facto annexation”.",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq61w10qwpo,"Yolande Knell,",2024-07-05 17:10:29,
96,Victoria Starmer: Who is the new UK PM's wife?,"Throughout the general election campaign and much of her husband's tenure as Labour leader, Victoria Starmer has kept a low profile. Apart from appearances at Labour conferences, the odd state banquet and a Taylor Swift concert, Lady Starmer, nee Victoria Alexander, has sought to avoid public appearances  Asked on LBC about his wife's low profile, Sir Keir pointed out that she had a full-time job at an NHS hospital and that their eldest child was doing his GCSEs. “We took the decision that whilst I was out and about on the road, we wanted to create the environment where he could study calmly in ordinary circumstances.” However, now that Sir Keir has won the election and become prime minister, Lady Starmer may find it trickier to shun the spotlight.  When she first met Sir Keir in the early 2000s, he wasn't a politician but a barrister. She was a solicitor working on the same case.  Sir Keir told ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories, of their first meeting: ""I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate. ""I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said 'let's get her on the line.'"" He grilled her forensically on the paper but as he hung up he heard one comment from her. ""She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,"" Sir Keir said. ""And quite right too."" Despite the rocky beginnings, the relationship blossomed after a first date in the Lord Stanley pub in Camden, north London.  Speaking to his biographer Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir described her as ""grounded, sassy, funny, streetwise - and utterly gorgeous too"".  He proposed just a few months later on a holiday in Greece. ""Won't we need a ring, Keir?"" was her down-to-earth response.  They were married in 2007 at the Fennes estate in Essex, walking down the aisle to one of Sir Keir's favourite pieces of music - Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.5, 2nd movement. He later described her to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs as an ""incredibly warm, wonderful woman. My complete rock"". The couple have two teenage children - but have been at pains to keep them out of the limelight - making a point of not naming them in public.  Lady Starmer grew up in north London, not far from where she currently lives with her family.  She attended Channing School before studying law and sociology at Cardiff University. While there, she got involved in student politics, becoming president of the student union in 1994.  In an interview with the student newspaper Gair Rhydd, she said her main priority was to campaign against cuts to student grants.  Rob Watkins was at Cardiff University at the same time and worked as a photographer for the paper. He remembers the future Lady Starmer as being ""witty and professional, clearly dedicated to her work"" and aware of her responsibility to the people she represented.   Lady Starmer currently works in occupational health for the NHS - something her husband has frequently referred to during his time as Labour leader.  He says it gives him insight into the problems faced by the health service.  Speaking to the Times in May, Sir Keir said his wife intended to keep her job if he won the election.  “She’s absolutely going to carry on working, she wants to and she loves it."" While the couple say they want to keep life as normal as possible for their children, their domestic life has already been disrupted by Sir Keir's job. In April, pro-Palestinian demonstrators held a protest outside their home, hanging a banner outside their house and laying children's shoes outside the front door.  Lady Starmer had returned from a shopping trip with her son when she saw the protesters.  Asked how the protest made her feel, Lady Starmer said: ""I felt a bit sick, to be perfectly honest.""",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe2veedg40o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-05 11:10:29,

102,General election 2024 in maps and charts,"The Labour Party has won a landslide majority in the 2024 general election.  The party is set to take 412 seats with a majority of 174, with one result yet to be declared. It is the worst Conservative result in terms of seats in history, with the party forecast to win as few as 122. The Liberal Democrats have their highest tally since 1923, taking 71 seats. The SNP is forecast to finish with 10 seats. Reform UK have five and Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have four each.  Some 23 seats were won by other parties, all in Northern Ireland, and independent candidates. The biggest gap on record has emerged between the share of the vote won nationally by parties and the number of seats they have gained. Labour gained over 200 seats but their vote share increased by less than two percentage points to 34%. The Conservatives saw their vote share plummet by 20 points to 24% and the party lost 251 seats. Reform are in third place by share of the vote on 14% but they found it difficult to convert votes into seats. The party has returned five MPs, including party leader Nigel Farage in Clacton. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats’ 12% vote share translated into 71 seats. The Greens recorded their best ever general election performance, winning four seats and seven per cent of the vote.  This map shows the seats which have been won by a different party to the last general election. To see all the results use the ""Changed hands"" toggle.  All of the new seats Keir Starmer's party took came from constituencies won by either the SNP or the Tories at the last general election. A total of 182 seats changed from blue to red. All of Reform's gains came from seats previously won by the Conservative Party in 2019. Labour lost five seats to independent candidates, including former party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North. Labour also lost one seat, Leicester East, to the Conservatives and Bristol Central to the Greens. The Conservative vote share suffered particularly in areas where high numbers voted to leave the European Union, falling by 27 points in constituencies where more than 60% voted Leave. Labour support in constituencies with large Muslim communities fell about 23 points to 39%. Click through the slides on these maps to see constituency vote share by party. Scotland is the only part of the UK where Labour’s vote share rose sharply. It jumped by 17 points as the party took 36 seats from the SNP. The SNP share of the vote is down 15 points. They also lost three seats to the Liberal Democrats. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, lost his seat in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. The Conservatives lost 12 seats in Wales, meaning they now have no MPs there.  Labour gained nine seats, taking the party's total to 27, despite their share falling by four points. Plaid Cymru has gained two seats, putting the party on four and the Liberal Democrats have taken one seat. Sinn Féin has become Northern Ireland's largest Westminster party, winning all seven seats it won in 2019, while the Democratic Unionist Party lost three of the eight it held at the last general election. In a surprise result, Traditional Unionist Voice took North Antrim from the DUP, unseating Ian Paisley Jr.  Looking at seat and vote share change across broad areas of England, the Conservatives have lost more than 100 seats in the South excluding London and their vote share is down by about 24 points.  Labour has made seat gains in the Midlands, North and South and has also increased its already-strong London tally by seven seats.  The Liberal Democrats have increased their seats in the South by more than 40, their highest regional tally.  Labour and Lib Dem vote shares fell somewhat in London, while hardly changing in the North and Midlands. Vote share for the two parties rose slightly in the South.  Reform share is up in all of these broad regions.  Turnout across the UK as a whole is 60%, the second lowest in a UK election since 1885. Only 2001 was lower with 59%. It was lowest in Wales, where only 56% of the electorate voted. Northern Ireland had a turnout of 57%, Scotland 59% and England 60%. The lowest turnout of any constituency was 40% in Manchester Rusholme, where Afzal Khan held the seat for Labour. The bottom five for turnout also included Leeds South, Hull East, Blaenau Gwent & Rhymney and Tipton & Wednesbury.

98,Champion Alcaraz beats Tiafoe in five-set thriller,"This video can not be played Carlos Alcaraz defeats Frances Tiafoe in five-set thriller Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz avoided a surprise exit at Wimbledon by holding off American Frances Tiafoe in a five-set thriller. The Spaniard won an intense match 5-7 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 in front of a raucous Centre Court crowd. It keeps Alcaraz's hopes of winning back-to-back major titles alive after triumphing at the French Open last month. ""Obviously it is always a big challenge playing against Frances,"" said third seed Alcaraz. ""All I was thinking is 'fight one more ball'."" Friday's first match on the main show court lived up to the pair's previous meeting in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open. Alcaraz was the victor on that occasion as well, beating Tiafoe in a five-set epic on the way to winning his first Grand Slam title. World number one Jannik Sinner is also through to the last 16 after an emphatic 6-1 6-4 6-2 win against Miomir Kecmanovic. This video can not be played 'That was extraordinary!' - Daria Kasatkina tops shots of the day five Tiafoe was seeded 10th at Wimbledon last year, but he has since dropped down the rankings and suffered second-round exits at this year's Australian Open and French Open. Now 29th in the world rankings, he frustrated Alcaraz throughout and received the early backing of the crowd after coming back from a break down to take the opening set. ""He is a really talented player, really tough to face,"" Alcaraz added. ""He deserves to be at the top, he deserves to fight for big things."" Alcaraz, who had not dropped a set at the Championships until then, regained control in the second, but a single break of serve was enough for Tiafoe to win the third. The American waved to the crowd and pointed to his ears, calling for more noise under the closed Centre Court roof. The fans willingly obliged, cheering on the 26-year-old through the fourth set until it reached a tie-break after both players' serve held firm. Sensing the crowd were on his opponent's side, Alcaraz whipped up emotion with cries of ""vamos"" after striking huge winners and he cruised his way through to force a decider. From there it was plain sailing for the three-time major winner, who broke twice before raising his arms in celebration after sealing the victory with a delightful drop shot. He will play American Brandon Nakashima or French 16th seed Ugo Humbert in the fourth round.

Australian Open champion Sinner was one of those to benefit from the use of the show courts, featuring last on Centre Court to book his place in round four. The top seed raced through the first set in 21 minutes and was on course for a bagel after breaking opponent Kecmanovic twice, but the Serbian managed to salvage one game. World number 52 Kecmanovic found his feet in the second set but it was still all on Sinner's terms as he wrapped up the match in one hour and 36 minutes. Sinner will play either American 14th seed Ben Shelton or Canada's Denis Shapovalov next. Shelton leads Shapovalov 3-2 in the first set of their match, which will resume on Saturday at 13:00 BST on Court One after rain halted play on Friday. Queen's champion Tommy Paul wrapped up a 6-3 6-4 6-2 win over Alexander Bublik on court two before the rain arrived. Meanwhile, Bulgarian 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov moved past Frenchman Gael Monfils 6-3 6-4 6-3 under the Court One roof.

99,Talk of easy draw shows 'entitlement' - Southgate,"This video can not be played The England team look in a different place mentally - Southgate England boss Gareth Southgate has warned against an ""entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents"" before Saturday's Euro 2024 quarter-final with Switzerland (17:00 BST). The Three Lions are two wins from the final after avoiding favourites Spain and France on the other side of the draw, meaning England cannot meet them before the showpiece in Berlin on 14 July. On the eve of the last-eight match with Switzerland - live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app - BBC sports editor Dan Roan asked Southgate whether England need to take the opportunity of being in the perceived easier side of the draw. ""We are playing a really strong football nation who have played exceptionally well, have enormous pride,"" said Southgate, who takes charge of his 100th game as boss. ""I would say that is a classic example of the entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents. ""Our focus is on how do we win this game and how do we play to the best of our ability? We have never been to a final outside England, we have only had two finals in our history, three semi-finals.  ""So lots of nations who we might perceive as English people to be smaller have far better records than us in terms of winning things, in getting to the latter stages in finals.  ""It's half of the problem we have. We're ready for tomorrow and, as a team, we have huge respect for our opponents."" Bellingham free to play against Switzerland  'Why three at the back can bring the best out of England' Why England could revert to back three at Euro 2024 England were seconds away from going out of Euro 2024 when Jude Bellingham scored a 95th-minute equaliser against Slovakia in the last 16.  Harry Kane then headed the winner in extra time to set up the quarter-final with Switzerland in Dusseldorf, with the winners facing the Netherlands or Turkey in the semis on Wednesday, 10 July (20:00 BST). England have produced four under-whelming performances at Euro 2024 but Southgate said he expected better against the Swiss. ""I feel that the team, even in training, now look in a different place mentally, they look more fluid,"" he added. ""The longer the players are here, the more belief they have, the less they are being affected by what's outside. They can see the opportunity. ""Every game can take you on a journey, like the game the other night. We have to deliver tomorrow, we have to be ready to go until the last minute again, dig deep in the moments that you have to.  ""They are highly motivated guys and can see the possibility of a semi-final. There is a buzz about them and they are excited to take that challenge on."" This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? With some fans venting their anger over the team's displays in Germany, Southgate's position has come under scrutiny. In February, the Football Association made it clear they were keen for him to remain in charge beyond Euro 2024. But Southgate, who steered England to the 2018 World Cup semi-final, the Euro 2020 final as well as a World Cup quarter-final in 2022, has yet to sign a new contract, with his current deal due to expire in December. There has been speculation about his future after the tournament - whether England win it or not. ""If you are in one of the most high-profile jobs in world football then there is always going to be speculation, always going to be assessment of what is going on,"" said Southgate. ""I'm not worried. When I was a young manager you are worried if the first job doesn't go well you will never get another job. You worry about failing and getting the sack.  ""I'm older, I'm not worried about losing, what might go wrong. We have an opportunity tomorrow to get to another semi-final.  ""It's about going for it now.""

97,UK election: What's happened and what comes next?,"Sir Keir Starmer is the UK's new prime minister, after his Labour Party swept to power in a landslide general election victory. The Conservative Party suffered a dramatic collapse after a tumultuous 14 years in power, which saw five different prime ministers run the country. It lost 250 seats over the course of a devastating night.  Rishi Sunak - the outgoing PM - accepted responsibility for the result and apologised to defeated colleagues during a brief statement outside a rainy 10 Downing Street. He said he would resign as party leader in the coming weeks. In his first speech as prime minister after greeting dozens of jubilant Labour supporters who had lined Downing Street, Sir Keir vowed to run a ""government of service"" and to kick start a period of ""national renewal"".  ""For too long we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity,"" he said. ""I want to say very clearly to those people. Not this time.""  ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while, but have no doubt the work of change will begin immediately.""  The result marks a stunning reversal from the 2019 election when Labour, led by the veteran left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, suffered its worst electoral defeat in almost a century.  On the other side, Robert Buckland, a former Conservative minister who lost his seat, described it as ""electoral Armageddon"" for the Tories. It is the party's worst result in almost 200 years, with an ideological battle over its future direction expected ahead.  It's been a long night of results. Here's what it all means. Britain's House of Commons has 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of their ""seats"" represents a constituency, or district. So far Labour has won 412 seats, while the Conservatives have slumped to just 121 and centrist Liberal Democrats have taken 71. Reform UK, a successor to the Brexit Party, is set to pick up four seats, as is the left-wing Green Party.  There is just one seat left to be declared, in Scotland, for the constituency of Skye and Ross-shire.  Labour's surge was partly aided by the collapse of the Scottish National Party (SNP). The party has been hit by a succession of controversies around its finances and fell to just nine seats overnight. The expected 170-seat majority in the House of Commons for Labour is an enormous number but still short of the majority of 179 won by the party under Tony Blair in the 1997 election.  But for more perspective, the Conservatives' win in the 2019 election under Boris Johnson - seen as a very strong performance - saw them get a majority of 80 seats.  A reminder: If a party holds a majority, it means it doesn't need to rely on other parties to pass laws. The bigger the majority, the easier it is. There were, however, a number of notable defeats for Labour to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza tickets - especially in areas with large Muslim populations.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance to the conflict. In February, the party called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but critics said it was too slow to reach that position.  Centre-left parties in other Western countries were keeping a keen eye on the trend ahead of the poll, amid fear of a growing backlash from their own voters over their support for Israel.  As constituencies have declared their results live on television - with all candidates lined up next to each other on stage - there were some major moments. Perhaps the most notable was the defeat of Liz Truss. The former prime minister served just 49 days in Number 10 before being ousted by her party. She narrowly lost to Labour in the constituency of South West Norfolk, having previously held a huge 24,180 majority. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative business secretary and arch-Brexiteer, was another of the biggest names to suffer defeat. He lost his East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour.  He told the BBC that he couldn't ""blame anybody other than myself"" for the loss but he took a ""small silver lining"" from the fact that the Conservatives would be ""at least the official opposition"" - a reference to fears they wouldn't even have that. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, looked rattled after losing his seat in southern England.  Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, who ran against Rishi Sunak for the party leadership before he became prime minister, lost her seat in Portsmouth. As the night wore on, a succession of other Conservative cabinet ministers also lost their seats, including Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer.  But Jeremy Hunt, who served as chancellor - the UK equivalent of a finance minister - held on to his seat but with a much-reduced majority. Mr Sunak also won his seat in Yorkshire with a comfortable majority of about 12,000 -  but used his acceptance speech to concede and confirm his party had lost the election.  Labour lost two big names of their own. Jonathan Ashworth and Thangam Debbonaire were both expected to be a part of Keir Starmer's incoming cabinet.  Things move pretty fast in British politics - there is very little time between an election result and the installation of the new prime minister.  By mid-morning moving vans had arrived to help Rishi Sunak out of 10 Downing Street. He was then whisked away to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.  Then, just 14 hours after the initial exit poll dropped, Sir Keir was formally invited by the monarch to form the next government. Moments later - watched by the world's media - he walked up Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time as prime minster.  He has already started appointing a new cabinet.  Angela Rayner has been made deputy prime minister, while Rachel Reeves has become the first female chancellor.  Meanwhile David Lammy is the new foreign secretary with Yvette Cooper as home secretary. Speaking before he handed his resignation to the King, Mr Sunak wished the new PM well.  ""His successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent public spirited man who I respect.""    He's fairly new to politics, relatively speaking. Sir Keir started his professional life as a barrister in the 1990s, and was appointed the director of public prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, in 2008. He was first elected in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency in north London in 2015, and took over leadership of Labour after the party's poor 2019 general election, pledging to start a ""new era"" after the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir was re-elected in the same constituency on Thursday, saying in his victory speech people were ""ready for change"" and promising an ""end the politics of performance"". ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community, your future,"" he said. ""You have voted. It's now time for us to deliver."" The Labour leader largely avoided making big pledges during the campaign. But during his address outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said his government would strive to ""rebuild"" British public services such as the NHS, slash energy bills and secure the country's border.  ""You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change,"" he vowed.  You can read Sir Keir's full profile here. This election's insurgent party was Reform UK, the right-wing successor to the Brexit Party and the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage, its leader, finally won a seat on his eighth attempt - but his party's initial projection of 13 seats fizzled to four. That's still better than UKIP and the Brexit Party ever did, and Mr Farage has been celebrating. The party's share of the vote looks to be about 14%. Reform drew controversy during the campaign over offensive statements made by some of its candidates and activists.  Mr Farage will be joined in the House of Commons by former Conservative party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, Reform founder Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe. From their new perch in parliament, the party could seek to cause trouble for the Conservatives and pick off more voters from the party's remaining base.

100,Evenepoel wins time-trial as Pogacar stays in yellow,"Remco Evenepoel won his first Tour de France stage Remco Evenepoel claimed his first victory at the Tour de France in stage seven's individual time-trial as Tadej Pogacar held on to the leader's yellow jersey. The Belgian, who is the current world time trial champion, underlined his credentials as one of the favourites in the general classification, with a superb run on 25.3km course to finish 12 seconds ahead of Slovenia's Pogacar. Evenepoel, 24, who thought he had suffered a puncture on the approach towards the finish in Gevrey-Chambertin, is now just 33 seconds behind Pogacar overall. Another Slovenian, Primoz Roglic was third 34 seconds down, while defending champion Jonas Vingegaard conceded 37 seconds in fourth.  The Dane now trails by one minute and 15 seconds in the GC after also losing time on stage four. Simon Yates was the top-placed British rider in the time-trial, finishing 1:33 behind Evenepoel. The stage win gives Evenepoel, who is wearing the white jersey as the best young rider in the race so far, stage victories in all three Grand Tours. ""It's crazy. I enjoyed every metre of this time trial and coming out with the win was simply amazing,"" said the Soudal-Quick Step rider. ""We wanted a stage win, and that is done. It's a perfect day for me and my team. Mission accomplished. As for the rest of the Tour de France, I believe Tadej is going to be unreachable. But this is cycling, you never know what can happen.  ""I think the further into the race we go, the better I will feel, so I'll focus more on the podium because I feel I have the legs for it."" Before Friday's stage Pogacar had forecast that Evenepoel would be the man to beat in a discipline he excels in.  However, the two-time winner produced a determined ride of his own to extend his advantage over Roglic and Vingegaard, who will now see the mountain stages as their best opportunity to regain ground. ""I can be satisfied,"" Pogacar said.  ""I would have loved to have taken a stage win today but against Remco it's a bit tough. But I  gained time on Primoz [Roglic] and Jonas [Vingegaard] and the other guys so I can be really happy.""

104,Man City & Man Utd cleared by Uefa to play in Europe,"Manchester City won the Champions League for the first time in 2023 Manchester City and Manchester United have been cleared to take their places in European competition next season after conflicts over multi-club ownership with Girona and Nice respectively were resolved. However, United will be prevented from signing highly-rated Nice defender Jean-Clair Todibo by Uefa. City Football Group owns City and Girona, while Ineos controls the football operations of United and Nice, and Uefa does not allow clubs with the same ownership to be involved in the same competition. The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) of European football's governing body said on Friday ""significant changes"" had been made at Girona and Nice which would ""substantially restrict investors' influence and decision-making power"". In addition, shares have been transferred through independent trustees to a blind trust, which will be supervised by the CFCB. Among additional guarantees given by the City Football Group and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos Group to prove the independence of the respective clubs, they agreed not to transfer players ""permanently or on loan, either directly or indirectly from July 2024 to September 2025"". This means United will not be able to sign Frenchman Todibo, the £40m-rated defender Ratcliffe had hoped would switch clubs. However, City's pursuit of Brazilian winger Savio will be unaffected as he has returned to parent club Troyes, who are also part of the City Football Group, after his loan with Girona expired on 30 June. A CFG source told BBC Sport that City and Girona were compliant with all the CFCB requests. Ineos said in a statement: ""We are pleased with the positive decision from the First Chamber of the Uefa Club Financial Control Body which will see Manchester United play in the Europa League next season. The focus for Manchester United is on the season ahead and performance on the pitch."" City will be playing in their 14th consecutive Champions League campaign, but Girona qualified for the first time by finishing third in La Liga, their highest ever league position. Nice also seemed set to qualify for Europe's most prestigious club competition for a long time last season, but eventually finished fifth in Ligue 1. Manchester United qualified for the Europa League by beating Premier League champions City in the FA Cup final. It remains to be seen how the matter is dealt with over the longer term, given the shares are due to be transferred back in July 2025. At that point, CFCB say the clubs will be considered to be ""under the control or decisive influence of their investor"".

105,'Like a Euros final' -  'insatiable' Spain a 'winning horse',"This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 Germany Spain hero Mikel Merino says their Euro 2024 quarter-final win over hosts Germany could have been a final - and coach Luis de la Fuente compared his team to a ""winning horse"". La Roja edged the battle of the two top-scoring teams and arguably the most impressive in the European Championship so far. Dani Olmo, who played 112 minutes despite starting on the bench, opened the scoring and set up fellow substitute Merino's extra-time winner - with Florian Wirtz levelling for Germany in the 89th minute. Spain will play France in the semi-finals on Tuesday. Real Sociedad midfielder Merino said: ""I'm exhausted. The adrenaline is taking its toll on me now. It's been a unique moment. ""The match we were all waiting for, between two of the best teams in the world. It could be a World Cup final or a European Championship final.  ""We have shown that we know how to suffer, that we have a great team."" Spain score 119th-minute winner to beat hosts Germany and reach semi-final 'A flip of a coin' - tearful Germany suffer 'bitter' exit Spain have been one of the most impressive teams in the Euros, beating 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia and European champions Italy - plus Albania - in the group stage and Georgia in the last 16. Their young wingers Lamine Yamal, who is just 16, and Nico Williams, 21, have been two of the stars of the tournament. But they had to win this one in a different way, with the pair - and striker Alvaro Morata - all replaced at 1-0. De la Fuente said: ""I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable. ""They're used to competing at the highest level and they have an opportunity to win the tournament. ""How far we will get, we will see, but we're absolutely convinced that we can get very far with this side. ""We are so happy, but our euphoria is totally under control. We know tomorrow is already another day."" Spain will be without suspended defenders Dani Carvajal and Robin le Normand for the semi-final - and midfielder Pedri is an injury doubt after going off in the eighth minute for Olmo. Fifteen players were shown cards in the game - the second highest in a European Championship game - with seven for Spain, including Le Normand and Carvajal, who was sent off for two bookings. ""I played in the 80s - if you want to watch a video of the 80s and see how football was played back then, you know I don't get scared. I have a friend who says, 'what do you want, to get kissed?"" De la Fuente said.

111,Gaza hostage posters torn down outside US politician's office,"Vandals tore down posters of Israeli hostages hung on the wall outside the Capitol Hill office of a Democratic politician on 4 July, his office said on Friday. Congressman Brad Schneider called the the damage ""a vile act of hate"".  The posters included photos of more than 100 people, eight of them Americans, taken as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.  Capitol police said they were investigating. Mr Schneider, a pro-Israel Democrat from Illinois, posted a photo on Twitter/X showing the posters shredded and thrown across the hall.  ""This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day,"" he wrote.   ""Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.""  The incident comes less than a week after pro-Palestinian protesters held an overnight rally outside Mr  Schneider's Highland Park home in Illinois. Mr Schneider said masked demonstrators banged drums, blew horns and screamed antisemitic chants outside his home. Police dispersed a crowd of around 40 people after several complaints from neighbours. Mr Schneider said such actions ""play directly into the hands of Hamas terrorists enabling them to continue to hold hostage not only those they kidnapped from Israel, but all civilians in Gaza as well.""  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Over 100 were released during a November cease-fire.  At least 38,010 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2nn9nkmwo,"Rachel Looker,",2024-07-05 23:08:55,
113,Ukraine lorry collides with minibus killing 14,"Fourteen people have been killed in a serious road accident in western Ukraine. A senior regional official said the fatalities resulted from a lorry driving into oncoming traffic and colliding with a minibus.  Twelve passengers, including a six-year-old child, and the two drivers were killed, while one woman survived with serious injuries, officials said.  Criminal proceedings have been opened into the incident. It happened near the village of Verkhiv, in Rivne region at about 15:45 local time (12:45 GMT), the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Koval, said on his Telegram channel. Possible reasons for what happened are being investigated. Pictures posted by the Emergencies Ministry showed wreckage of a vehicle in a field and a child's toy lying on the ground.

110,Air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16 people,"At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured in the attack on the building which was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Video from the scene shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded. The Israel Defence Force (IDF) said it struck several “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.  The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter. One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit. ""This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning,"" she said. A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. The BBC is unable to verify this claim. In a statement posted to X - formerly known as Twitter - the IDF confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken ""numerous steps"" to ""mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence"". Hamas militants were using the location as a ""hideout"" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said. ""Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,"" it added. Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.  Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel. The latest incidents come after hopes began to rise in recent days that a deal between Israel and Hamas was on the horizon, following months of false starts. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the June incident as ""horrific"" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was ""shocking"" but could not be confirmed. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng04kpv2do,"Rushdi Aboualouf and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-06 20:08:55,
112,"Air strike leaves 100,000 without power in Ukraine","A Russian attack on a power facility in Ukraine has left 100,000 people without power in the north-western region of Sumy. Work is under way to restore power, National grid operator Ukrenergo said, following the strikes, which caused emergency shut-offs for consumers in the city and region of Sumy, which borders Russia. There were no reports of casualties or damage apart from the energy facility, Reuters reports. Russia continues to pummel energy facilities across Ukraine, often plunging the country into extended blackouts with people enduring sweltering summer conditions without running water, air conditioning, or life-saving medical equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says, losing all of its thermal power plants to enemy action and seeing all hydroelectric sites damaged by drones or missile strikes.  This is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption, and more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, according to the national grid operator. Poland has been diverting surplus electricity to Ukraine to help it cope with the Russian strikes, but Ukrenego has scheduled cut-offs of electricity throughout the day across the country as domestic generation and electricity imports could not cover the deficit. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo told the BBC she is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it is obvious why: all our life, all our civilisation, is built on electricity,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian air defences shot down 24 out of 27 Shahed kamikaze drones Russia launched on the night of 5-6 July, the Air Force Command has reported on Telegram. The drones were intercepted over areas including the Sumy region, using electronic jamming and anti-air defences, it said.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0dmwjnmp4mo,"Vitaly Shevchenko and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-06 14:08:55,
108,Biden interview fails to quell Democrat concerns over fitness,"President Joe Biden's Friday night TV interview does not seem to have quelled an uprising within his own party to end his re-election campaign after a halting debate performance against Donald Trump.  A fifth House Democrat,  Angie Craig of Minnesota, on Saturday joined colleagues in calling for the president to step aside, and reports suggest more could follow. In his rare prime-time ABC News interview, Mr Biden dismissed his debate performance as just a “bad episode” and said only the ""Lord Almighty"" could convince him to end his bid for re-election. Mr Biden, 81, is spending Saturday at his family home in Delaware before two public events on Sunday.  There is growing unease among Democrats, although no senior members of the party have called for him to quit. Some polls show Trump's lead over Mr Biden widening, and many are concerned about losing the presidency and House seats, along with the Senate majority, if he leads the ticket.  Ms Craig, who is running in a competitive district in Minnesota, said on Saturday that she did not believe Mr Biden could ""effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump"".  She said that while she respected his decades of service, ""there is simply too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency"". Minutes after the ABC interview, Texas congressman Lloyd Doggett, the first House Democrat to call for Mr Biden to drop out, said on CNN that the need ""is more urgent tonight than when I first called for it"".  He said the longer it took Mr Biden to make a decision to withdraw, the ""more difficult for a new person to come on board who can defeat Donald Trump"". Other House Democrats including congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts called on Mr Biden to withdraw on Friday.  They join Arizona's Raúl Grijalva's call on Wednesday.  In his interview, Mr Biden declined to take a cognitive test and make the results public to prove he was fit to serve another term. ""I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test - everything I do [is a test],"" he told George Stephanopoulos. This response did not resonate  with Democratic congresswoman Judy Chu of California, who told Politico that his answer was “unsettling and not particularly convincing"" and that she would ""be watching closely... especially in spontaneous situations"". During the 22-minute ABC interview, Mr Biden rejected suggestions allies may ask him to stand aside, saying ""it's not going to happen"".  Mr Stephanopoulos pressed the president on his capacity to serve another term. “I don’t think anybody’s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,"" Mr Biden said.  Mr Biden, who is due to speak at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked Vice-President Kamala Harris for her support during the ABC News interview.  Ms Harris has emerged as a top contender to replace him if he were to step down. In an interview on Saturday at the Essence black culture festival in New Orleans, the vice-president said that November's election was crucial to American democracy, but made no mention of Democratic disquiet about Mr Biden. Essence was the first of a number events in July that appear to target female black voters, a key constituency for Democrats in November.  However, questions around Mr Biden's candidacy and the potential for Ms Harris to take his place will be difficult to avoid. Ms Harris has spent the last week close to the president, flying from Los Angeles to attend the White House 4 July celebration, sitting in a meeting with governors and Mr Biden, and also being involved in his call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vice-presidents have the delicate balancing act of projecting unequivocal support for their bosses while also tacitly proving they are up for the main job. That has been more so for Ms Harris as questions swirl around Mr Biden's re-election bid. However, some Democrats acknowledge concerns about Ms Harris as a presidential candidate. She struggled to gain her footing early in her vice-presidency as she was given responsibility for issues including immigration, student debt and voting rights.  Low approval ratings have dogged her in office, although they have improved in recent months. She has since refocused her attention on issues such as abortion rights, which Democrats believe will be crucial in November.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8971wl12r8o,"Rachel Looker and Courtney Subramanian,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,
107,Cyclist fined for kissing wife during Tour de France,"French cyclist Julien Bernard has given a light-hearted apology after being fined for kissing his wife during a Tour de France time trial.  The Lidl-Trek rider was made to pay 200 Swiss francs ($223; £174) by the International Cycling Union (UCI) for stopping briefly during stage seven of the race. The governing body said the fine was for ""unseemly or inappropriate behaviour during the race and damage to the image of the sport"".  Writing on social media, Bernard apologised to the UCI for ""having damaged the image of sport"" but said he was willing to pay the fine ""every day and relive this moment"".  Stage seven of the Tour de France is a short course of 23.3km (14.5 miles) and is one of two time trials in the race - where cyclists race against the clock for the best time. The climb takes place in the famous wine region of Burgundy. According to Cycling News, Bernard was just 30 minutes from where he lives when he was met by his supporters. As he reached the top of a climb, friends ran towards him holding signs and his wife stepped forward - at which point she gave him a quick kiss, holding their son who was dressed in a replica cycling kit.  A fine for the same amount and for breaking the same rule was given earlier in the race to Italian cyclist Davide Ballerini, after he stopped to watch Britain's Mark Cavendish sprint to a record-breaking 35th Tour de France stage victory.  In a television interview following the stage, Bernard said the encounter with his loved ones had been a unique moment in his career and he had pushed hard earlier in the stage so he would have enough time to do so.  ""It was really incredible. My wife has been organising this with some friends for a few weeks now and she did a really, really good job,"" he said.  ""On a time trial, you have time to enjoy yourself. It's these moments that keep me going and cycling.""",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9vwvy430o,"Michael Sheils McNamee,",2024-07-06 14:08:55,
106,"We have too many prisoners, says Britain's new PM","Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to reduce the number of people going to prison through renewed efforts to cut reoffending. In his first press conference as prime minister, Sir Keir said too many people found themselves back in jail ""relatively quickly"" after being sent there. He added that intervening to prevent young people committing knife crime would be an early priority for his new government. But he said there would be no ""overnight solution"" to prison overcrowding, adding: ""We’ve got too many prisoners, not enough prisons."" It comes after he appointed a businessman as his prisons minister who has previously said only a third of prisoners should be there. James Timpson, boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of recruiting ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that ""we're addicted to punishment”. Labour, which won a landslide general election victory on Thursday, has promised to review sentencing after regaining office for the first time since 2010. It has also inherited a ballooning crisis in Britain's jails, and has already committed to keeping the previous Conservative government's early release scheme in place to ease current levels of overcrowding.  Last week the Prison Governors’ Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days. Tory ex-justice secretary Alex Chalk first announced plans to release prisoners early in October 2023. Mr Chalk, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in the general election, told MPs at the time the ""prison population is greater than it has ever been"" and the UK ""must use prison better"". However, he added: ""We must do whatever it takes to always ensure there are always enough prison places to lock up the most dangerous offenders to keep the British public safe."" Details of Labour's review are yet to be unveiled, but Mr Timpson's appointment has offered an early signal that a change of approach may be on the cards in this area. Sir Keir has appointed him a member of the House of Lords, allowing him to take up a post as prisons minister at the Ministry of Justice. The businessman told a Channel 4 podcast in February that prison was a ""disaster"" for around a third of prisoners, and another third ""probably shouldn’t be there"". He said too many people being in prison for ""far too long"" was an example of ""evidence being ignored because there is this sentiment around punish and punish”. ""We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,"" he added. Asked about his comments at a Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir did not offer a view on whether he agreed with those estimates. But he added: ""We do need to be clear about the way in which we use prisons. “For so many people [who] come out of prison, they’re back in prison relatively quickly afterwards. “That is a massive problem that we have in this country, that we do need to break."" He said his party wanted to cut knife crime in particular, and cited his plan to set up a network of ""youth hubs"". Sir Keir, a former lawyer, added: “I’ve sat in the back of I don’t know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. “I’ve often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they’d had support”. Labour says it wants to create 20,000 prison places by enabling ministers to override local councils on planning decisions.  But it also plans to keep in place the scheme implemented by the last government under which some lower-level offenders can be released up to 70 days early. Sir Keir said Conservative ministers had created a ""mess"" by failing to build enough prisons and mismanaging the prisons budget. Defending his decision to keep the early-release scheme in place, he added: ""We don’t have the prisons we need, and I can’t build a prison within 24 hours."" The latest official figures, published on Friday, put the prison population of England and Wales at 87,453 out of a ""useable operational capacity"" of 88,864. The SNP-run Scottish government, responsible for prisons in Scotland, plans to release between 500 and 550 inmates in the coming months. It comes as Sir Keir convened the first Labour cabinet meeting in 14 years,  telling his top team he expects them to hold themselves and their departments to the ""highest standards of integrity and honesty"". A Downing Street readout from the meeting said the prime minister told ministers ""the whole country was looking to the government to deliver on their priorities"". Following the cabinet, Sir Keir was grilled by journalists at his first press conference as PM. Asked about tax hikes, Sir Keir said he would take ""tough decisions"" and face challenges with ""raw honesty"". The new Labour government faces tough choices on public finances, with forecasts suggesting major spending cuts. But Thursday's landslide victory in the General Election has given Labour ""a clear mandate to govern for all four corners of the United Kingdom,"" Sir Keir said as he set out plans to tour all four UK nations in the coming days. Saturday also saw the final result of the general election, with the Lib Dems winning the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 BST on Friday, but a recount meant the results were delayed until Saturday afternoon. Candidate Angus MacDonald gained a majority of 2,160 over the SNP's Drew Hendry. It means the Lib Dems have won 72 Westminster seats. Six of these are in Scotland, meaning the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish Conservatives as Scotland's third largest party in Westminster.  Across the UK, Labour won 412 seats while the Conservatives were on 121.  ",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16jpkzz9g3o,"Paul Seddon,",2024-07-06 19:08:55,
109,French far right seeks vote win but deadlock looms,"France votes in one of its most significant elections in years on Sunday, with the far right hoping for a historic victory, but political stalemate the more likely result. This is the first time the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella has had a realistic chance of running the government and taking outright control of the National Assembly. But after the RN’s first-round victory in snap parliamentary elections last Sunday, hundreds of rival candidates dropped out to give others a better chance of defeating the far right. Voting begins in mainland France at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and the first exit polls will be released 12 hours later. Whatever the result, it is difficult to see President Emmanuel Macron coming out of this well. Four weeks ago, he said it was the responsible solution to call a snap vote in response to the RN’s victory in European elections, minutes after the party’s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella challenged him to do so. The two-round election came as a shock to a country gearing up for the start of the Paris Olympics on 26 July. Security was already tight and now 30,000 police have been deployed for a period of heightened political tension. There are fears of violence in Paris and other French cities, whatever the outcome of the vote, and a planned protest outside the National Assembly on Sunday evening has been banned. In Dreux, a historic old town on the road to Normandy, Sunday’s vote falls on the day the Olympic flame is passing through. “For us it’s a massive thing, bigger than the election,” says Pauline in the tourist office. The flame has been travelling around France for almost two months, and Dreux has planned a weekend of festivities to mark its arrival. “Macron should have waited until after the Olympics,” Dreux resident Antoine told the BBC. Veteran commentator Nicolas Baverez believes the president has not just blown up his term in office and opened the gates of power wide for the far right. “He’s compromised the running of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which could deliver a final blow to France’s credit and its image,” he wrote in Le Point on the eve of the vote. The constituency that includes Dreux is one of the races to watch in the second round of this election.  Candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already won their seats, by winning more than half the vote. But another 500 contests are being decided in run-offs, mostly involving either two or three candidates. Former conservative cabinet minister Olivier Marleix was beaten in the first round by far-right candidate Olivier Dubois. They both qualified for the run-off, along with a candidate from the left-wing New Popular Front, which is in second place nationally. But because Nadia Faveris was narrowly beaten into third by her conservative rival, she pulled out of the race “to block National Rally”. One voter, Morgan, was sceptical that anything would change in the town, whoever won. There have been 217 of these withdrawals across France, including 130 Popular Front candidates and 81 from the president’s Ensemble alliance. And that has dramatically changed the balance of this pivotal general election. Projections after Sunday’s first round gave the RN a fighting chance of securing an outright majority of 289 seats, but final opinion polls on Friday suggest that is now out of reach, with 205 to 210 seats as a potential maximum. The parties trying to block an RN victory range from the radical left, Communists and Greens to the Macron centrists and conservatives. They say they are defending the Fifth Republic from the extreme policies of the far right. National Rally has watered down many of its policies but still wants to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing. It aims to abolish the right of automatic citizenship to the children of immigrants who have spent five years aged 11 to 18 in France. It also wants to bar dual nationals from dozens of sensitive jobs. Opinion polls are not necessarily reliable. Each of the 500 races is a local contest and voters do not follow recommendations from political parties. If the RN managed upwards of 250 seats, it might seek out allies to form a minority government. President Macron's party had to make do with similar numbers until he became frustrated with his limited ability to pass reforms in parliament. That kind of RN government is unlikely, believes Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris. It would soon face a vote of no confidence, he believes, and under the constitution, France cannot have another general election for at least another year. Another potential scenario is a “grand coalition” that would involve most of the other parties, except for the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party, which the Macron alliance and conservatives reject as extremists. This idea has gained some momentum in recent days, but Greens leader Marine Tondelier has made clear “there’ll be no Macronist prime minister”, whatever happens. There is also talk of a technocrat government, similar to those that ran Italy during the eurozone debt crisis. But instead of choosing experts from outside politics, it might include politicians with proven expertise in particular fields. In any case, France is entering uncharted territory, says Jean-Yves Dormagen of the Cluster 17 institute. President Macron himself has said he is not about to resign and will continue to serve out his final three years in office. “We will have Macron as a lame duck president who created this mess without having to do so,” Prof Steinbach told the BBC. “And he’s losing legitimacy.” The immediate concern for France is to have some kind of government in place during the Olympic Games. Constitutional expert Benjamin Morel believes the president could form a national unity government until the end of the Paris Games. “That would give the parties time to to reach an agreement between now and the start of the school year and the next budget,” he told Le Figaro.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0ygnyxgnqo,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,
125,Junta chiefs 'turn their backs' on West Africa bloc,"Niger's military leader, speaking alongside the junta chiefs from Mali and Burkina Faso, has said they are ""irrevocably"" turning their backs on the wider West African bloc, Ecowas. The three men are meeting together for the first time to cement an alliance created in the face of opposition from neighbouring countries. Soldiers took power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in a series of coups from 2020 to 2023. All three countries – which now form the Alliance of Sahel States - have been affected by jihadist violence, in part a reason given for the army takeovers.  In January, they all announced a plan to leave Ecowas, which is holding its own summit on Sunday. Speaking at Saturday’s meeting in the Nigerien capital, Niamey, the country's leader, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, said that in the place of Ecowas, the junta chiefs wanted to build a community of sovereign peoples ""far from the control of foreign powers. A community of peace, solidarity, prosperity based on our African values.” Gen Tchiani is hosting the talks with Burkina Faso’s Capt Ibrahim Traoré and Mali’s Col Assimi Goïta. In a message on X, the Burkinabé leader said that ""together, we will consolidate the foundations of our true independence"". Speaking at the summit, Capt Traoré went on to say that ""this continent has suffered and continues to suffer from the fire of the imperialists. These imperialists have only one cliché in mind: 'Africa is the empire of slaves'."" Security co-operation is high on the agenda, but the alliance, known by its French acronym AES, will also look towards forming closer economic ties, including the aim of creating a common currency. This would be a rejection of the France-backed CFA Franc, which is used in many states across the region. All three countries have expelled French soldiers who were there as part of an anti-jihadist mission and turned towards Russia for military assistance. Calls for greater sovereignty and a rejection of the former colonial power have been a key part of the rhetoric coming from the junta leaders. The countries have also resisted calls from Ecowas for a rapid return to civilian rule. Capt Traoré arrived in Niamey a day ahead of the meeting and was welcomed with an enthusiastic reception. Television pictures show cheering crowds waving Nigerien and Burkinabé flags. Among them was Sidi Mohamed, the head of the National Youth Council. ""Today, as Africans, we are very proud to see a summit where it's an African summit, a summit where states have decided to pool their energies, to pool their forces to create an alliance for their development, without any foreign stakeholders, without any counterparts from the powers that are used to ruling over us,” he told journalists. Col Goïta arrived on Saturday. The presidents of the wider West African bloc will have their chance to respond at a heads of state meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on Sunday. They are also due to announce the activation of a standby force to fight regional insecurity. Over the past decade, the Sahel has become an increasing focus of Islamic State militant activity, creating insecurity and instability. The juntas in Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali have so far failed to quell the violence. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

124,Celebrating 50 years of marriage in Nigeria’s 'divorce capital',"A couple who live in Nigeria’s “divorce capital” are being hailed for their long marriage having recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir spoke to the BBC about the secrets of their happiness, and about why so many marriages fail in the northern city of Kano, in a video that has generated much comment. Mr Yusuf puts it down to his wife’s generous nature. “She is a very unselfish person and she overlooks a lot which has contributed to the success of our marriage,” the 76-year-old told BBC Hausa. This prompts a smile from Ms Tahir, who is in her late sixties. Together the couple have had 13 children - and she praised her husband’s ability to remain calm in the face of the difficulties all families confront. “He is a very patient man and I feel that was also key to our success,” she said. The pair say they love and respect each other - and they clearly enjoy each other’s company, breaking off to laugh several times during the interview. For Hassana Mahmud, it is a revelation. The 39-year-old divorcee has been married five times and is impressed by the couple and their evident contentment. ""In all my marriages I have only spent four years with a spouse - so to see them on social media celebrating this milestone was refreshing,” she said.  “My husbands were all nice and caring during courtship but changed after the wedding,"" said the mother of four. “I feel bad whenever I hear people call Kano 'the divorce capital of Nigeria', I hope things will change,"" she added. Kano gained the epithet after divorce rates began to rise in the 1990s and it has not been able to shake off the unwanted label. Hundreds of marriages collapse each month in Nigeria’s most populous state, whose capital, Kano city, is the commercial hub of the north. In 2022 research done by the BBC in collaboration with the local government disclosed that 32% of marriages in Kano state only survive between three and six months. It also revealed that some people aged between 20 and 25 had already gone through three marriages. The scale of separations is a concern - especially for the Hisbah, a Kano state-funded Islamic agency that deals with moral issues and enforces Sharia, or Islamic law in the state. It has a police unit that enforces things like segregation in public places and an alcohol ban for Muslims, who make up the majority of residents. It also has a counselling service mainly to help struggling married couples. Long lines of women can often be seen queueing outside its offices to complain that their ex-husbands are not helping with maintenance for their children. People tend to marry young in Kano - often before the legal age of 18. Others feel Islam’s easy method of divorce might be a factor as husbands can simply tell their wives: “I divorce you” or write that on a piece of paper and it is over. Nowadays a message sent on social media is enough to end their marriage. Aminu Daurawa works for the Hisbah to address the high divorce rate. One of their solutions is to offer a second chance to people and better prepare them for married life. The agency organises mass marriages, known as “Auren Zawarawa”, mainly for divorcees - acting as a matchmaker on a giant scale. The hundreds of newly wed couples, who are treated to a big wedding ceremony, are also offered a small sum to help them set up a business and other household goods. This initiative began in 2012 - though Mr Daurawa acknowledges divorce rates are still high. “We know about that problem - that is why we set up a committee to check on each couple after the marriage so we don't get the former [same] results,” he said. But Hadiza Ado, founder of non-governmental organisation Women and Children Initiative, says the number of divorces continue to rise. “At the moment we get up to 30 marital cases daily in our various offices,” she told the BBC. “The troubling Nigerian economy is the number-one reason at the moment. “Husbands go out to make ends meet and sometimes come back home empty-handed, which causes rifts.” The practice of using matchmakers is common in Kano because in a Muslim society single people do not mix, so it is difficult to meet potential partners.  The only place that the sexes mix would be at university or other tertiary institutions, which most people do not attend. When people are matched together they often get married hardly knowing each other. In fact Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir were introduced as youngsters by an older woman in their neighbourhood. She was the one who felt they would be a good match - but they did not tie the knot for another 12 years, giving them ample time to get to know one another. One man with a reputation for making successful matches says that is key. “A lot of investigation needs to be done before marriage to know the persons involved,” Rabiu Ado told the BBC. He set up as a matchmaker 10 years ago. The 46-year-old had not intended to become a marriage broker, though it had been the job of his mother. He was working as a truck driver when he was approached by friends complaining about the difficulty of finding a partner. After making some successful introductions, he realised he had a knack for the family business. He now has billboards advertising his services - and gets between one and five clients each day. He interviews them and gets to know their attitudes and expectations. Often men want a woman who can make money and women want rich men. “A lot of people go into marriages with the wrong mindset, which is why they get disappointed after some time.” He says he has organised around 500 marriages over the last decade, with a success rate of more than 90%. He counsels couples to always take time to know each other well before marrying. Mr Ado, who has the nickname ""Mai Dalili"" meaning ""He who makes it happen"", says the high number of divorces means some people don't take marriage seriously. “I feel why divorce is high in Kano is because people feel I can always get another person after a divorce.” Islamic cleric Abdullahi Ishaq Garangamawa defends the ease with which Muslims can get a divorce. “Islam is merciful and made marriages and divorces not hard so that people will not be caged when things aren't going right,” he told the BBC. ""In the past we didn't have this many divorces as our parents were married for decades. It was in recent times that people started abusing the process for selfish interests,"" he says. ""But in essence, unlike in some religions where it's till death no matter the situation, Islam legalises divorce when things get out of hand."" Mr Yusuf, who used to work for the now-defunct Nigeria Airways, says sharing life’s difficulties and helping one another has been crucial to his enduring partnership with Ms Tahir. “Love is also key because when you love each other genuinely you tend to stay together. “My advice to people getting married is not to get into it for selfish reasons but go into it with genuine intentions.” His wife agrees, adding: “My own advice is that people wanting to get married have to be patient with each other - if one partner is angry, the other should be calm.” Additional reporting by Abba Awwalu Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

122,'We've learnt to do surgery without electricity': Ukraine's power cuts worsen,"Power supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son.  He was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication. ""We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,” Tetiana tells the BBC. Ukrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country. Persistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day. Tetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant.  She has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down. Power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too. ""Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,” she says. “My son can die if he doesn't get oxygen. I'm lost for words.” Recent blackouts have lasted as long as 12 hours a day in Tetiana's neighbourhood. For millions of Ukrainians, the absence of power can mean no running water, air conditioning, lifts or access to life-saving equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says. This is more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. It is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption – or Slovakia, Lavtia, Lithuania and Estonia combined, Ukrenergo says. ""All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. All hydropower plants in our country are damaged by Russian missiles or drones,"" Ukrenergo spokeswoman Maria Tsaturian tells the BBC. The lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems. To cope with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country, which last for many hours a day every day. As a result, millions of Ukrainians have become increasingly reliant on fuel-powered generators or big power banks. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been experiencing lengthy power cuts. Roksolana was elected by residents of her 24-storey apartment block to help run the building's facilities. She says living in tower blocks is not easy because power cuts also mean no running water on the upper floors. “The lifts are not working either, so mothers with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on when there is electricity,” she adds. “They've got to stay indoors for six hours on end, our elderly ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread."" Such residents in tall buildings are stuck inside their sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working.  They are also more exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go to the safety of the bomb shelters, which are typically located underground. In Zaporizhzhia, dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv says appointments have to be rescheduled at the last moment, and there've been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery. ""If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have started. There's no other way - we can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow,"" he says. ""Literally a couple of weeks ago power cuts became particularly frequent. Of course they're very disruptive."" To perform urgent or less complicated operations during blackouts, Mr Stefaniv uses a head torch. This is a skill he acquired and perfected while treating soldiers on the front line, and his firm still provides free or heavily discounted services for members of the Ukrainian army. ""I can treat toothache or swelling without electricity. We've learnt to perform surgery without electricity,"" he says. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it's obvious why: all our life, all our civilization, is built on electricity. You just have to destroy your enemy's power grid, and they will have no economy, and they will have no life,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom.""",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724532nqyno,"Vitaly Shevchenko,",2024-07-05 23:08:56,
121,'I'm worried' - Democrats at Biden rally open to change,"The hundreds of die-hard Democrats who turned out to see Joe Biden in Wisconsin on Friday didn’t need much convincing. The US president received an enthusiastic response to his loudly delivered remarks at the rally in Madison, especially when he attacked his Republican rival Donald Trump. But as some major Democratic donors and lawmakers call on Mr Biden to exit the presidential race, even some of his most ardent supporters here in Madison are keeping an open mind about whether he might be replaced - and what might come next. “It’s OK to change our minds,” said Catherine Emmanuelle, 44, who paused and considered her thoughts carefully before outlining her opinion.  She stressed that she was impressed with Mr Biden’s 17-minute speech, which she called a “presidential litmus test”. “But if something happens in three days or a week or three weeks, we shouldn’t be afraid of having a conversation about change,” she told BBC News. Mr Biden is under tremendous scrutiny after a disastrous debate performance last week, marked by a hoarse voice and several instances where he lost his train of thought. The president, 81, is facing a tide of doubts about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump, 78, in November's election.  Friday’s rally, held in this reliably Democratic town in a critical swing state, was an indication of the support Mr Biden still has in many parts of the country. But the raucous crowd, which waited through several opening speakers and a hour-long delay from the planned start time, was also shot through with low-grade anxiety. “I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump,” said Thomas Leffler, a 33-year-old health researcher.  ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said - a reference to the Democratic Party's signature colour.  Mr Leffler suggested that picking a new candidate might have unexpected benefits. “If you go through some sort of open process, you can re-energise people, and show that there’s a process better than what Republicans have, which is basically just to bow down to Donald Trump,” he said. Earlier this year, both the president and Trump secured the delegates needed to be their party's respective presumptive candidates. The Democrats' nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from 19-22 August. On Friday, Mr Biden was defiant about staying in the race, telling the crowd: ""I am running and going to win again.” Some of the biggest cheers on Friday came when the president directly went after his predecessor. “Trump is not just a convicted criminal,” he said. “He’s a one man crime wave.” The prospect of a second Trump administration was an animating factor for many who came to the rally. “During the debate, he told a bunch of lies,” said Greg Hovel, 67. “How is that any worse than what Biden did?” Mr Hovel said he believed the country was in a “great place” and that Mr Biden didn’t get enough credit for his economic and pandemic recovery policies. “At this point, in the next six weeks, the Democratic Party is going to have to make up its mind” whether to retain Mr Biden as their candidate or pick someone new, he said. But the president’s performance on Friday further bolstered something he strongly believed, even before the speech. “I think Biden can win,” he said.

120,"Rescue street dogs, or euthanise them? Turks split over its strays","Under the shade of a leafy green apricot tree on a scorching summer afternoon, Gokcen Yildiz scoops up a squirming ball of light-brown fur. It licks her all over the face and she breaks out in giggles.  But laughter gives way to a more serious tone as she points to the dog's back legs, which are missing paws. A sign, she says, of the abuse some of Turkey’s street dogs are subjected to. Ms Yildiz is a secondary school physics teacher by day, street-dog advocate by night. The canine she’s holding is one of 160 she’s collected on the property where she lives on the outskirts of Turkey’s capital city, Ankara. Her dogs are a small fraction of the estimated four million that make up the country’s street-dog population. It’s a problem that has fiercely divided public opinion: are stray dogs a neighbourhood fixture to be looked after and loved?  Or does the government need to take more drastic solutions, like those state media are reporting that it's considering - including euthanasia? On her 15,000 sq m property, Ms Yildiz looks after elderly and disabled dogs, and those with psychological or behavioural issues. “It is not my job, but I look after dogs in need,” she said. “I always experience financial worry because the economy is getting harder. When the price of petrol increases, everything like pet food or the medicine I give, or the vet expenses - everything goes up.” She said she feels anxious about finances, but her bigger concern is what will happen to the dogs if she doesn’t collect them. “The dogs outside of here eat every two or three days, but they’re alive. They’re not about to die. That’s what really worries me,” she said. Lawmakers from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) are working on a new bill aimed at getting dogs off the streets. It hasn’t yet been introduced into the country’s parliament, but state media report it could require municipalities to collect stray dogs, shelter them for around 30 days, and if the animals are not adopted in that time, euthanise them. The latter provision has outraged animal rights activists - and Turkey’s dog lovers, like Ms Yildiz - but it’s also raised questions about whether existing facilities across the country could handle additional responsibilities. Only about one third of the nation’s provincial and district municipalities have shelters, according to Doctor Murat Arslan, president of the Turkish Veterinary Medical Association. He said this had been one of the problems with an existing law, which requires dogs to be sterilised and then returned to the streets where they lived. “In order to manage the animal population, street dogs needed to be collected, sterilised, given some vaccinations, and then released back to the street. However, not every municipality had shelters or facilities where these operations could be carried out. Especially in small municipalities, there are neither shelters nor sufficient employment of veterinarians.” If this law, enacted 20 years ago, had been enforced, the street-dog population wouldn’t be so large today, Dr Arslan said. Animal abandonment and overbreeding and selling of dogs had also allowed the street-dog population to rise, he told the BBC. Although animals are microchipped and registered in a centralised database, officials needed to be better at following through with fines for owners when animals were found to have been thrown out on the street, he added. Regardless of what led to the problem, campaign groups like Safe Streets Association argue a solution is needed to take dogs permanently off the street. Attorney Meltem Zorba is a volunteer for Safe Streets. She works with families that have been victims of stray-dog attacks, and points to government statistics that show over the past five years, street dogs have contributed to 55 deaths, more than 5,000 injuries, and 3,500 traffic accidents. “We have been pressuring for legal change for three years,” she said. “There should not be stray dogs on the streets. These attacks on people causing death, traffic accidents, and other animals being attacked are unacceptable.” She’s calling for a legal requirement to take dogs off the streets for good - rather than the catch-and-release protocol in place now. Ms Zorba also says the dogs pose other concerns including rabies and public health issues arising from dog faeces in public places, such as parks and playgrounds. “This is rationality,” she said of the creation of new legislation, adding that euthanasia should be a last resort and a result of an animal being deemed too sick or posing a risk to society. That’s where a national consensus seems to be building. A recent opinion poll showed nearly 80% of respondents supported measures to take dogs off the street and provide shelter. But less than 3% believed collected dogs should be euthanised. Both Ms Zorba and Ms Yildiz support a government solution that would allow dogs to be taken off the streets, collected in newly-built shelters around the country, sterilised, and looked after through the end of their lives, if not adopted. It’s believed that ministers plan to provide local authorities with fresh funds to implement any new law on stray dogs. But it’s unclear whether the government - already dealing with an economic crisis that’s seen inflation climb to 75% this year - has the resources available for such a solution.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnl020jvyppo,"Victoria Craig,",2024-07-06 00:08:56,
123,Inside Keir Starmer's preparations for power,"“A face of thunder.” As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the State Opening of Parliament deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives’ plans laid out year after year. He carried the curse of the leader of the opposition – irrelevance. He formally became prime minister at lunchtime on Friday, but for a number of months now, he has also known that the British state has been quietly preparing for his arrival in Downing Street. “We have every hour of his first day, every day of his first week, every week of his first month, mapped out,"" is how one Whitehall source put it. What promise this victory holds is not going to fail because of a lack of homework or planning. Such is the level of preparation that the Treasury, in anticipation of the arrival of the first female chancellor, has apparently boxed in the urinal that has long been a feature of the chancellor’s private bathroom. Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!). Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.  Rachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir’s team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: “We have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.“ The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into “implementation plans"" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: “It’s ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget” without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys. Despite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir’s mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. “There are no secrets,” one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a “vote for a more radical, bold approach”. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change “proves” Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to No 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won’t be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through. And it’s likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government’s independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space. The Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair’s frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: “I so deeply regret that we didn’t hit the ground running on reform."" “Keir has taken this incredibly seriously,"" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet’s been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.  I’m told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: “They come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet – that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, ‘now, can I talk to you about the end of the world!’” Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he’s also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should ""Go quick! Go fast, before they find the loos!"" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don’t stay eager forever. Labour’s scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn’t make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away.  Whenever she’s been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the ""worst economic inheritance since the Second World War"" or as she said at her election count in Leeds ""there is not a huge amount of money"". Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters’ clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: “Things really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside."" Labour’s ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: “From today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.” A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories’ fault. What of the new PM himself? It’s not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it’s a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as “nauseating” pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase “moral socialism”. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a “force for good and a force for change“. That’s a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who’s been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. “He’ll be the most normal PM we’ve ever had,” says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. “He is theirs,” the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he’ll return politics to serve the people through what he terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw. It was Sir Keir’s belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer’s friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a “decade of renewal“. Just before polling day, one insider joked: “I’m never not thinking about winning the next election.” By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more “face of thunder” for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.

118,Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian elected Iran's president,"Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian has been elected as Iran's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili.  The vote was declared in Dr Pezeshkian's favour after he secured 53.3% of the more than 30 million votes counted. Mr Jalili polled at 44.3%.  The run-off came after no candidate secured a majority in the first round of the election on 28 June, which saw a historically low voter turnout of 40%. The election was called after Iran’s previous president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May, in which seven others also died. The leaders of China, India and Russia have all congratulated Dr Pezeshkian on his victory. Even before the final results were declared by Iran's interior ministry, Dr Pezeshkian's supporters had taken to the streets in Tehran and a number of other cities to celebrate. Videos posted on social media showed mostly young people dancing and waving the signature green flag of his campaign, while passing cars sounded their horns.  Dr Pezeshkian, a 71-year-old heart surgeon and member of the Iranian parliament, is critical of Iran’s notorious morality police and caused a stir after promising “unity and cohesion”, as well as an end to Iran's “isolation” from the world.  He has also called for “constructive negotiations” with Western powers over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of Western sanctions. His rival, Saeed Jalili, favours the status quo. The former nuclear negotiator enjoys strong support amongst Iran’s most religious communities. Mr Jalili is known for his hardline anti-Western stance and opposition to restoring the nuclear deal, which he says crossed Iran’s “red lines"". Turnout in the latest round of voting was 50% - higher than the first round last week, when the turnout was the lowest since the Islamic revolution in 1979 amid widespread discontent, but still considerably low. Widespread discontent meant that millions of people boycotted the elections.  Lack of choice in the candidates, dominated by Islamic hard liners, and the impossibility of real change as long as the supreme leader tightly controls policies added to their frustration. Some people who did not vote in the first round were persuaded to cast their ballot for Dr Pezeshkian this time round to prevent Mr Jalili from becoming the president.  They feared that if he won, Iran would be heading for more confrontation with the outside world and that he would bring Iran more sanctions and further isolation. In order to stand, both candidates had to make it through a vetting process run by the Guardian Council, a body made up of 12 clerics and jurists that hold significant power in Iran.  That process saw 74 other candidates removed from the race, including several women. The Guardian Council has previously been criticised by human rights groups for disqualifying candidates who are not loyal enough to the regime. After years of civil unrest - culminating in anti-regime protests that shook the country in 2022-23 - many young and middle-class Iranians deeply mistrust the establishment and have previously refused to vote. On Iranian social media, the Persian hashtag ""traitorous minority"" went viral, urging people not to vote for either of the candidates and calling anyone who did a ""traitor"".

117,Murray's Wimbledon career over as Raducanu pulls out of doubles,"Andy Murray is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event Andy Murray's Wimbledon career is over after Emma Raducanu pulled out of their planned appearance in the mixed doubles. Former world number one Murray, 37, was due to play alongside his fellow Briton on Saturday evening at the All England Club. Raducanu, 21, said she has ""some stiffness"" in her right wrist. She moved into the fourth round of the women's singles with a dominant two-set win over Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari on Friday. ""I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles,"" she said. ""I’m disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but I've got to take care."" This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, was playing at SW19 for the last time before retiring later this year. The Scot is said to be ""disappointed"" that he is unable to play alongside 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, who missed Wimbledon last year after having surgery on both wrists. Murray's mother Judy, in response to a post on X from television presenter Marcus Buckland describing Raducanu's decision as ""astonishing"", wrote: ""Yes, astonishing."" Murray was not permitted to find a replacement partner for Raducanu under tournament rules because the draw had already been made. Murray and Raducanu, who were set to play China's Zhang Shuai and El Salvador's Marcelo Arevalo, have been replaced by an alternate pairing. It means Murray made his final appearance on Thursday when he lost alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation. Murray pulled out of the singles on Tuesday as he continues to recover from a back operation on 22 June. The three-time major champion is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event. 'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray 'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Wimbledon Saturday’s schedule played a major part in Emma Raducanu's decision. Being asked to play in the fourth match of the day on Court One is the same as being asked to play in a night session. And given this Grand Slam is a predominantly daytime event, you can understand why a player would not want to spend all evening on site with a fourth-round singles match the following day. The schedule put Raducanu in a very awkward position, and has led to a decision which will be very disappointing for Murray and everyone looking forward to what would have been a fun finale to his Wimbledon career. This was no ordinary mixed doubles pairing, although players do regularly prioritise singles over doubles. And there can be no change of partner once the draw is made. So instead of Murray teaming up with another British player, American alternates Rajeev Ram and Katie Volynets come into the draw.

116,"Sam Carling: Meet the new youngest MP, born in 2002","A 22-year-old elected as an MP with a razor-thin majority has said he does not want his age to be the focus as he heads to Westminster. Labour’s Sam Carling is likely to be the ""baby of the House"" - the unofficial title given to the youngest member of the House of Commons - after narrowly winning North West Cambridgeshire. The Cambridge University science graduate student beat veteran Conservative MP Shailesh Vara by 39 votes to take the seat. Mr Carling called his victory a ""political earthquake"", and said he hoped more young people would stand for public office. ""Then they will see themselves represented, both in Parliament and local councils. It will help tackle apathy,"" he said. The previous ""baby of the House"" was Oxford University graduate and fellow Labour MP Keir Mather, who won the Selby and Ainsty by-election in 2023. Mr Carling, who has been a councillor in Cambridge, said many voters were surprised to discover he was running for office, but that ""people on the doorstep were very positive"". ""They said ‘That’s good, we need more young people’. ""There is a lot of abuse aimed at younger people online, but face-to-face, people are generally thrilled to find out."" However, he doesn't want his age to be a focus. ""I want us to get away from this strange mindset towards younger people’s age. As far as I’m concerned we’re just the same as anyone else. I just want to get on with the job."" He only recently became interested in politics, saying he saw a connection between social and economic decline and ""decisions made in Westminster"". Mr Carling grew up in a rural town in the north-east of England, which he described as ""a very deprived area"". ""I saw a lot of things getting worse around me. I was concerned about shops closing on local high streets that used to be a thriving hub and are basically now a wasteland.  ""And the sixth form closed, but I didn't make the connection to politics until later."" In his constituency, largely based in the city of Peterborough, he said the new Labour government had ""a whole host of issues to deal with – it's a microcosm of the country"". He wants his party to ""get to grips with"" a lack of dentists and NHS staff ""who are dreadfully overworked"", as well as ""fixing rural transport"". Mr Carling said it would be ""interesting to see"" what his generation makes of a new era of politics. ""I think a lot of people have only ever been conscious of a Conservative government. ""I would argue we can make significant changes and offer a better alternative, and hopefully engage more young people in politics,"" he added. Follow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

115,What can we learn from Starmer's first day as PM?,"The last time I recall a cabinet meeting on a Saturday was during the Brexit years and the time before that was due to the Falklands War. In other words, they are rare. This one was about cracking on, and being seen to crack on, with the job of government with a momentum and energy. Standing in Downing Street and watching and talking to ministers – as we will get used to calling them – there was a first day at school vibe. Easy smiles, time to chat with the security staff, an excitement to clutch a red ministerial folder.  The novelty will no doubt wear off for them, and the slog of governing kick in. But this time, at least, there was a knowing awareness of the magnitude of this moment for them. It is 14 years since Labour ministers wandered around in Downing Street. And it is 27 years since they last kicked the Conservatives out of office. A couple of hours later Sir Keir Starmer looked comfortable, even relaxed, in the role of prime minister in his first news conference. Us reporters were led to the State Dining Room in the heart of No10, rather than the specially designed room in No9 built by the last government and associated in particular with rows about parties during the pandemic. These kinds of things do not happen by accident and who knows if this government will use the newer room on camera in future, but it was a visual marker of change. Sir Keir claimed to us that his government would confront the challenges it confronts with what he called a “raw honesty”. He and his ministers have already described prisons and the NHS in England as “broken”. How long there will be a patience with them blaming their predecessors, let’s see. What we will see next – and has been telegraphed in advance – is a blitz of activity and travel from the prime minister. It turns out that when you win a general election the meeting, greeting, dashing and smiling roadshow doesn’t end with a trip to the polling station. Sir Keir will travel to Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff in the next day or so and will meet England’s mayors on Tuesday. After that it will be a flight to Washington DC for the annual summit of the Nato defence alliance. A chance for the prime minister to meet fellow world leaders – and to be on a stage only presidents and prime ministers get an invite to. The week after (in other words, inside the next fortnight) there will be a King’s Speech – the State Opening of Parliament – where the government will set out its planned new laws. And then Keir Starmer will welcome around 50 fellow European leaders to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire the day after, for a meeting of what is known as the European Political Community, a new-ish body separate from the European Union. A whopping majority after offering “change” – coupled with a low turnout and a share of the vote lower than any other single-party post-war government – may afford this administration little time to demonstrate, if it can, that it is capable of delivery. There are determined not to waste any time.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728egw36gdo,"Chris Mason,",2024-07-06 20:08:56,
114,Sacred buffalo calf offers hope amid efforts to revive species,"With cream-coloured fur and jet-black eyes, one of the smallest specimens of America’s largest native animal stumbled into the spotlight on shaky legs. Advocates hope the June birth of a white buffalo calf  - an exceedingly rare event - will translate into new momentum for a decades-long push to revive the species in America's Great Plains. Many tribes consider a white bison birth to be a sacred omen that signifies change. The herd this calf was born into has also become an important cultural symbol - it's the last wild buffalo herd in North America.  The herd is entering a new chapter of its life as stewardship of the species is increasingly being overseen by indigenous communities again and advocates push to grow bison populations. The American buffalo, also known as bison, once numbered in the tens of millions before being brought to the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Now, the only wild herd in the US is limited to just 5,000 animals.  But tribes and bison advocates see opportunity as Yellowstone, America’s first national park and the home of the white calf, considers a proposal to expand the wild herd’s size for the first time in decades.  The white calf has added spiritual significance to buffalo advocates' efforts as they test a long-standing status quo where government policies prioritise beef ranching over the beliefs of native tribes.  Just after noon on 4 June, Yellowstone photography guide Jordan Creech was sightseeing with clients when he spotted the freshly-born white buffalo calf, taking its first steps in the park’s Lamar Valley. Bison calves can walk within two minutes of being born, and run alongside their herd within the first seven minutes of life. “It’s the most unique experience I’ve ever had,” Creech says. Erin Braaten, a photographer of Native American descent from Kalispell, Montana, also witnessed the calf’s first moments of life before it disappeared into the herd. ""I thought I'd have a better chance of capturing Bigfoot than a white bison calf,"" she tells BBC News. For the last 2,000 years the people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakoda tribes have told the story of a woman who arrived during a time of need. A version speaks of two scouts searching for food and buffalo in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The mysterious woman appeared and offered their tribe a bundle of sacred gifts, including a pipe carved from red rock, and instructed the people on how to live and pray. She transformed several times before taking the form a white buffalo calf with a black nose, black eyes and black hooves. As she departed, a great number of buffalo returned to feed the people. Dozens of other tribes have white buffalo stories, interpreting its arrival as both a blessing and a warning. Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Tribe, is known as the Keeper of the Sacred Bundle — the bundle and pipe left by the spirit. He likens the white calf’s return to the second coming of Christ. Looking Horse, 70, said that before she departed, the woman told the people that she would return as a white buffalo calf “when everything is sickly and not good, and when people are with a not good mind”. “This is spirit. It means spirit is happening,” he added. On 26 June, more than 500 supporters formally celebrated the white calf at an event in West Yellowstone, just outside the park. Nearly a dozen tribes were represented.  Together, they heard the name bestowed upon the calf - Wakan Gli, meaning Sacred Returns or Comes Holy in the Lakota language. An altar of three buffalo skulls and three buffalo robes marked the occasion. Waemaetekosew Waupekenay, 38, who travelled from Wisconsin to attend on behalf of the Menominee Tribe, said the birth of the sacred calf has been a spiritual awakening. Its arrival, he says with amazement, shows that “there's a lot of healing, a lot of love going around. People are being united.” National Park rangers at Yellowstone have confirmed the white bison's birth, but rangers have not reported any sightings themselves. “The birth of a white bison calf in the wild is a landmark event in the ecocultural recovery of bison by the National Park Service,” the park said in a statement on 28 June confirming it as the first white bison ever seen inside Yellowstone. They added that it ""may reflect the presence of a natural genetic legacy that was preserved in Yellowstone’s bison, which has revealed itself because of the successful recovery of a wild bison population"". ""The National Park Services acknowledges the significance of a white bison calf for American Indians,” it added. The Yellowstone bison make up the only wild herd in the US and are among the last genetically pure bison in existence. But Yellowstone National Park regularly reaches the legally-permitted capacity of 5,000.  Tribes who support the species' growth have stepped in, believing the species' health is tied to their own history. Since 2019, the US National Park Service has transferred 414 healthy bison from Yellowstone to 26 tribes in 12 states through the Bison Conservation Transfer Program. Native people also have their own distribution system to share buffalo independent of the park's efforts. Since 1992, the Intertribal Buffalo Council -  a collective of 83 tribes working to “restore the cultural, spiritual and historic relationships” with the animals - has sent 25,000 bison to 65 herds on tribal lands in 22 states. “People don’t understand or realise that what happened to the buffalo similarly happened to native people, and that history is intertwined,” says Jason Baldes, who serves as vice-president of the council and is a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The returning of buffalo to tribal people marks a major change in federal policy for a country whose soldiers had once been ordered to kill them all to deprive tribes of food and supplies. And officials are not only returning animals, they're considering taking on more themselves: the National Park Service has just completed an environmental impact study at Yellowstone, and determined that the size of the herd should increase from 5,000 to 6,000 - but could accommodate as many as 10,000. It's the first time the park has proposed an increase in 24 years. The herd’s growth is made more striking by the fact that up to 60 million American buffalo were killed in the rush to claim ownership of the American frontier.  Unlike the native people - who are known to use nearly every part of the animal for food, shelter and more – the settlers killed them with reckless abandon, taking furs and leaving carcasses to rot. By the 20th Century, no more than 1,000 bison remained in the wild. Large-scale cattle operations took over the empty land and commercial interests continue to be a source of conflict between those who wish to see the wild buffalo roam as they once did, and the livestock industry. Ranchers and the state's Republican governor oppose the park service’s proposal to expand the herd, fearing a disease called brucellosis - which is carried by about 60% of Yellowstone bison - could infect beef herds and undercut profit margins.  The Montana Stockgrowers Association, which opposes the plan, has warned that the new policy could lead “to an exponential growth in bison numbers”. Elk are also known to transfer brucellosis to domestic livestock, but do not face the same restrictions as bison. Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a Montana-based non-profit which works to increase wild bison numbers, says the debate “is part of the old range wars of the West, competition for grass and which animals get to eat it”. Yellowstone officials previously conceded that the controversy over bison management is a complex challenge with several opposing interest groups. “It’s probably the single-most challenging wildlife issue in Yellowstone,” Cam Sholly, the park superintendent, told the New York Times last year. “The bison is the only species we constrain to a boundary.” But for tribes, the birth of the white calf is proof that more needs to done to support bison. The fact that the calf comes from Yellowstone has imparted it with extra spiritual significance. “The Yellowstone [herd] are the most purest, wildest buffalo – the only left in the country,” Chief Looking Horse says. “This is a message that Mother Earth is speaking through the animal nation.”",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5xjzqree2o,"Max Matza,",2024-07-06 03:08:56,
119,Kimchi blamed for mass sickness in South Korea,"About 1,000 people in South Korea are suffering from food poisoning linked to kimchi contaminated with norovirus. Officials in Namwon City, in the south-west of the country, announced on Friday morning that there had been 996 confirmed cases - although local media reports say that number had climbed to 1,024 by early Saturday afternoon. Authorities said the popular fermented cabbage dish had been distributed to those now sick through school meals in the city. They added that students and staff from 24 schools were among the patients with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. Norovirus is very contagious and can be caught through touching contaminated surfaces - such as toilet flush handles - and from people who are already infected. Most people recover in a few days without needing hospital treatment, but some become very ill. Namwon City officials said it began an epidemiological investigation to uncover the source of the illness on Wednesday, after the first case was reported the previous day. Since then, the number of cases grew rapidly - rising from 153 on Wednesday to 745 on Thursday. In a social media post on Thursday, the city's Mayor, Choi Kyung-sik, said that health officials had adopted a ""pre-emptive and excessive response"" in an attempt to prevent further spread of the illness. ""We will ensure the safety of our citizens,"" he added. City officials said norovirus had been detected among patients, through environmental samples and in some of the kimchi regularly delivered to schools. As a result, its disaster and safety department had temporarily suspended the production and sale of any products from the company that made the kimchi - which is also in the process of voluntarily recalling products that have already been distributed. The firm that produced the kimchi has not yet been officially named.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58m22ljrro,"Aleks Phillips,",2024-07-06 14:08:56,
127,Mexico's coast battered by Hurricane Beryl,"Hurricane Beryl has lashed Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula after wreaking havoc across the Caribbean, causing at least 10 deaths.  It made landfall as a category-two hurricane early on Friday, bringing winds of up to 175km/h (108mph).  It was later downgraded to a tropical storm, but is expected to re-intensify over the Gulf the Mexico at the weekend. Beryl brought heavy rain to tourist hotspots of Cancún and Tulum. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages. Civil protection chief Laura Velazquez said power would be fully restored to those still without it by Sunday.  Tulum resident Carolina Vazquez was among those to be affected by the outages, speaking to the Reuters news agency as she queued at a soup kitchen organised by the Mexican army on Friday.  ""In my little house a tree fell down, half of the house cracked, the roof tiles,"" she said. Fernando Trevino, an employee at a local business, said: ""We are evaluating, but so far it seems that everything is in order with the protections that were put in place, the preparations and so."" Ahead of Beryl's arrival, Schools were closed, hotel windows boarded up, and emergency shelters were set up in areas facing the brunt of the impact.  More than 8,000 troops from the army, air force and national guard were deployed in the Yucatán Peninsula to provide support.  Hundreds of tourists were evacuated from hotels, and more than 3,000 fled from Holbox Island off the coast, according to local authorities. More than 300 flights were cancelled or delayed. On Thursday, many homes and businesses were badly damaged in the Cayman Islands, particularly along the coastline, where entire neighbourhoods were inundated. Hurricane Beryl battered Jamaica on Wednesday after causing huge devastation across other Caribbean nations.  Hurricanes frequently occur near the peninsula, with the official storm season running from June to late November.  The storm is projected to travel over the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas by the end of the weekend. By the time it makes landfall again on Sunday evening, the storm is expected to have strengthened back to a hurricane. Texas Governor Greg Abbott told people near the state's Gulf coast to ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"".

126,"We have too many prisoners, says new PM Starmer","Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to reduce the number of people going to prison through renewed efforts to cut reoffending. In his first press conference as prime minister, Sir Keir said too many people found themselves back in jail ""relatively quickly"" after being sent there. He added that intervening to prevent young people committing knife crime would be an early priority for his new government. But he said there would be no ""overnight solution"" to prison overcrowding, adding: ""We’ve got too many prisoners, not enough prisons."" It comes after he appointed a businessman as his prisons minister who has previously said only a third of prisoners should be there. James Timpson, boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of recruiting ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that ""we're addicted to punishment”. Labour, which won a landslide general election victory on Thursday, has promised to review sentencing after regaining office for the first time since 2010. It has also inherited a ballooning crisis in Britain's jails, and has already committed to keeping the previous Conservative government's early release scheme in place to ease current levels of overcrowding.  Last week the Prison Governors’ Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days. Tory ex-justice secretary Alex Chalk first announced plans to release prisoners early in October 2023. Mr Chalk, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in the general election, told MPs at the time the ""prison population is greater than it has ever been"" and the UK ""must use prison better"". However, he added: ""We must do whatever it takes to always ensure there are always enough prison places to lock up the most dangerous offenders to keep the British public safe."" Details of Labour's review are yet to be unveiled, but Mr Timpson's appointment has offered an early signal that a change of approach may be on the cards in this area. Sir Keir has appointed him a member of the House of Lords, allowing him to take up a post as prisons minister at the Ministry of Justice. The businessman told a Channel 4 podcast in February that prison was a ""disaster"" for around a third of prisoners, and another third ""probably shouldn’t be there"". He said too many people being in prison for ""far too long"" was an example of ""evidence being ignored because there is this sentiment around punish and punish”. ""We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,"" he added. Asked about his comments at a Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir did not offer a view on whether he agreed with those estimates. But he added: ""We do need to be clear about the way in which we use prisons. “For so many people [who] come out of prison, they’re back in prison relatively quickly afterwards. “That is a massive problem that we have in this country, that we do need to break."" He said his party wanted to cut knife crime in particular, and cited his plan to set up a network of ""youth hubs"". Sir Keir, a former lawyer, added: “I’ve sat in the back of I don’t know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. “I’ve often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they’d had support”. Labour says it wants to create 20,000 prison places by enabling ministers to override local councils on planning decisions.  But it also plans to keep in place the scheme implemented by the last government under which some lower-level offenders can be released up to 70 days early. Sir Keir said Conservative ministers had created a ""mess"" by failing to build enough prisons and mismanaging the prisons budget. Defending his decision to keep the early-release scheme in place, he added: ""We don’t have the prisons we need, and I can’t build a prison within 24 hours."" The latest official figures, published on Friday, put the prison population of England and Wales at 87,453 out of a ""useable operational capacity"" of 88,864. The SNP-run Scottish government, responsible for prisons in Scotland, plans to release between 500 and 550 inmates in the coming months. It comes as Sir Keir convened the first Labour cabinet meeting in 14 years,  telling his top team he expects them to hold themselves and their departments to the ""highest standards of integrity and honesty"". A Downing Street readout from the meeting said the prime minister told ministers ""the whole country was looking to the government to deliver on their priorities"". Following the cabinet, Sir Keir was grilled by journalists at his first press conference as PM. Asked about tax hikes, Sir Keir said he would take ""tough decisions"" and face challenges with ""raw honesty"". The new Labour government faces tough choices on public finances, with forecasts suggesting major spending cuts. But Thursday's landslide victory in the General Election has given Labour ""a clear mandate to govern for all four corners of the United Kingdom,"" Sir Keir said as he set out plans to tour all four UK nations in the coming days. Saturday also saw the final result of the general election, with the Lib Dems winning the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 BST on Friday, but a recount meant the results were delayed until Saturday afternoon. Candidate Angus MacDonald gained a majority of 2,160 over the SNP's Drew Hendry. It means the Lib Dems have won 72 Westminster seats. Six of these are in Scotland, meaning the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish Conservatives as Scotland's third largest party in Westminster.  Across the UK, Labour won 412 seats while the Conservatives were on 121.  ",2024-07-06 23:08:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16jpkzz9g3o,"Paul Seddon,",2024-07-06 19:08:57,
129,'One of the world's best' - Saka's 'special' moment of redemption,"This video can not be played Watch all the penalties from England's dramatic quarter-final against Switzerland Bukayo Saka is Stuart Pearce for the TikTok generation. Young fans watching England reach a European Championship semi-final via a perfect penalty shootout might not know who Pearce is, but there were more than a few echoes of Euro 96 in Dusseldorf on Saturday night. England have only scored all their penalties in a major tournament shootout twice – against Spain at Wembley in 1996, and versus Switzerland in 2024. Against Spain, Pearce slammed home the third spot-kick and celebrated in trademark style with a fist pump and roar, the sinews in his neck straining to breaking point. Against Switzerland, Saka slotted home the third spot-kick and celebrated in trademark style with a wide and beaming smile, the image of the star boy so loved by the new generation of England supporters. For both men, shootout success brought redemption. Pearce scored his penalty six years after missing in the 1990 World Cup semi-final defeat by West Germany. Saka scored his penalty three years after missing in a European Championship final defeat by Italy. When Trent Alexander-Arnold scored the winning kick, Saka did not rush to celebrate with the bulk of team-mates, but sank to his knees with arms aloft in thanks. This was redemption, Saka-style - done with class, abundant skill and with irresistible likeability. ""I think for me, it's something I embrace,"" Saka said of exorcising the demons of Euro 2020. ""You can fail once but you have a choice whether you put yourself in that position again and I'm a guy who is going to put myself in that position. ""I believed in myself and when the ball hit the net I was a very happy man."" ‘Arrogance and confidence’ – breaking down England’s perfect penalties Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast This video can not be played Watch: Saka equalises for England The demons of Euro 2020 had been racist, disgusting and vile. Saka, along with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, was subjected to the most horrendous abuse after missing in the shootout against the Italians. Saka, just 19 at the time, took the fifth kick for England and saw Gianluigi Donnarumma save his effort. He was left in tears on the pitch. Three years later, and the circumstances could not be more contrasting.  Saka - no longer a teenage squad player, but key to England’s hopes - had dragged his team back into the game with a brilliant strike from 18 yards, just five minutes after Breel Embolo put Switzerland ahead. And, at the end, after the penalty shootout, he was smiling and celebrating with his team-mates on the pitch amid joyous scenes. ""In that shootout, the smile on Saka's face was brilliant,"" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told BBC Radio 5 Live. “You can't help but be reminded of the [Euro] 2020 final and it was great to see him put it away.” Southgate, who held the sobbing Saka tight on the sodden Wembley pitch in 2021, went through his own shootout pain as a player. His was the one kick saved in the Euro 1996 semi-final as Germany edged past England. ""It was so brave from Bukayo - he is one of our best and we were never in question he would take one,"" Southgate said. ""But we all knew what he went through. “I love them all but I had to give him an extra-big hug. I know myself these experience shape you. He has come back stronger, still resilient and loved. Tonight his tournament ignited a little bit."" It was not just the cool head in the shootout, of course. Saka was the most vibrant attacking outlet for England throughout the match, the high point being his brilliantly taken goal just as it looked like the Three Lions were down and out. Swiss defender Michel Aebischer will never want to face Saka again. The England winger successfully dribbled past him four times in the first half, more than one player had beaten another in any Euro 2024 match until that point.

He beats players,"" former England defender Rio Ferdinand told BBC One. ""He is like Arjen Robben. You know he is coming inside but you can't stop him because he is so sharp. He is the one of best wingers in the world. ""Saka has come to England’s rescue again,"" added ex-England captain Alan Shearer. ""Big players step up in big moments."" Saka's stellar showing becomes even more impressive in the context of where he played. Southgate changed formation to a 3-4-2-1, with the Arsenal winger redeployed into a very unfamiliar role at right wing-back. Saka, who was unhappy to be played as an emergency left-back against Slovakia in the last 16, took to this role with gusto. He provided England with threat and sparkle out wide, beating his markers inside and out - a quality the Three Lions have lacked throughout a Euros campaign that could charitably be described as stodgy at times. ""Unbelievable to play a new position compared to what he's used to,"" England captain Harry Kane told BBC One when asked about Saka. ""He has been eager to help the team and to play the way he did for 120-minutes - at the end he was knackered."" Tired but beaming, Saka said this was ""up there"" with the best experiences of his England career. ""Last time we took a penalty shootout at the Euros, we know what happened,"" he told BBC One. ""I believed. I felt like we dominated the whole game and the chance would come and I took it - I am proud of myself for that."" Like Pearce, Saka has found England redemption in a Euros penalty shootout. But for the fans young and old who idolise him, who know what he had to go through three years ago, there is something extra sweet in the story of this remarkable young man.",2024-07-06 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c25ljqrq2w1o,Emma Smith,2024-07-06 22:08:58,
130,'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters,"Emma Raducanu has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time since winning the 2021 US Open Emma Raducanu knows full well what it is like to be a little-known qualifier upsetting the odds at a Grand Slam tournament. On Sunday, the boot will be on the other foot at Wimbledon. The 21-year-old Briton famously won the US Open as a teenager qualifier three years ago, creating one of the most stunning shocks in sporting history. Now Raducanu faces New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun, a 23-year-old who had never played in the Wimbledon main draw until this year. The pair meet in the fourth round at around 17:00 BST on Centre Court. ""Qualifiers are dangerous,"" said Raducanu, who has not dropped a set in her opening three victories. ""She’s had three extra matches here at Wimbledon and she is not to be underestimated."" Sun, ranked 123rd in the world, created one of the shocks of the tournament by beating Chinese eighth seed Zheng Qinwen in her first-round match. She is the first woman representing New Zealand to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon in the Open era. ""The preparation doesn’t change I don’t think, you just take it opponent by opponent,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world after injury issues last year. ""I'm expecting her to be really dangerous and come out swinging so it's going to be a really tough match."" Raducanu missed last year's Wimbledon after having surgery on both of her wrists and has needed to be patient on her return to the WTA Tour this year. Difficult decisions have also needed to be made. On Saturday, she made the ""very difficult"" move to pull out of her mixed doubles partnership with Andy Murray - whose Wimbledon career is now over - because of stiffness in her wrist. Raducanu has been cautious in her scheduling this year and opted to miss the clay-court French Open in order to ensure she was in peak condition for the British grass-court season. The move has been fully justified. After encouraging runs in Nottingham and Eastbourne, Raducanu has played some of her best tennis this week since winning the US Open. ""Honestly, I'm just obsessed with tennis right now,"" said Raducanu. ""It's all I want to do and all I want to think about."" Raducanu needed to come through a first-set tie-break against Mexican lucky loser Renata Zarazua in round one, but has dropped just 11 games since after commanding wins over Belgium's Elise Mertens and Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari. The excitement among the British fans at the All England Club has been further fuelled by Raducanu's section of the draw opening up. If the former British number one beats Sun, another unseeded opponent - Spanish former world number two Paula Badosa or Croatia's Donna Vekic - waits in the quarter-finals. ""I just love playing on the big stages so much,"" said Raducanu. ""It's my favourite thing in the world, it’s the reason I play tennis, to play on these big courts and these big matches. ""It’s really special, you don’t get these opportunities often in life.  ""When I look back later in my career, when I get much older and have retired, I want to be able to tell myself I savoured every moment. ""So I play each point as if it’s my last."" Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz opens the day's play on Centre Court when he faces French 16th seed Ugo Humbert in the fourth round. After Raducanu's match, there is an all-American clash between second seed Coco Gauff and 19th seed Emma Navarro. On Court One, Italian seventh seed Jasmine Paolini - who reached the French Open final last month - takes on American 12th seed Madison Keys. One of that women's quartet is a potential semi-final opponent for Raducanu should she get that far. Italian men's world number one Jannik Sinner, who is aiming for his first Wimbledon title, plays big-serving Ben Shelton of the United States. That match is followed on the second show court by Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev taking on Bulgarian 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov.

131,Djokovic bounces back to reach fourth round,"This video can not be played Djokovic beats Popyrin in four sets - Best shots Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic came from a set down to book his place in the Wimbledon fourth round with victory over Australia's Alexei Popyrin. After a slow start on Centre Court, Djokovic, who has 24 Grand Slam titles, won 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-3). He will play Holger Rune next after the Danish 15th seed mounted a comeback of his own, prevailing over Frenchman Quentin Halys in five sets having trailed by two. ""A very challenging match, I think mentally as well, to hang in there,"" said Djokovic.  ""I was not allowed to have too big concentration lapses. I think I've done well in that regard. That was one of the best tie-breaks I've played this year, that's for sure."" Popyrin, who had never been beyond the second round in four previous visits to Wimbledon, came out with intent and took the first set with a break of serve in game seven. But a lengthy break before the start of the second set as the roof was closed played into Djokovic's hands, as the Serb started to find his rhythm. The 37-year-old, still sporting a knee support on his right leg following surgery in June, broke Popyrin in the fourth game. There was a brief interruption to play late in the set when fans on Centre Court burst into celebration as England beat Switzerland on penalties to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2024. Fortunately, both players saw the funny side as Djokovic mimicked kicking a football and Popyrin raised his arms to imitate making a save. Djokovic went on to wrap up the set with his 1,000th ace in the men's singles at Wimbledon - just the sixth male player to achieve that feat. Momentum remained with Djokovic in the third, breaking Popyrin in the first game, and he dropped just three points on serve before another ace sealed the set. The fourth set proved a much tighter affair, with Djokovic missing three break points before a tie-break was required to settle the match. ""I didn't expect anything less than what we experienced on the court today from Alexei,"" Djokovic added. ""With that serve and powerful forehand, he's dangerous on any surface. ""I knew he was in form and he was going to come out believing he can win. He was the better player in the first set. I think I played a good second and third and the fourth was anybody's game. This video can not be played 'Couldn't do that again if he tried' - Ben Shelton hits incredible point Meanwhile Ben Shelton says he is ""100% ready to go the distance"" again after coming through a third successive five-set match to reach the Wimbledon fourth round. The American 14th seed defeated 2021 semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-2 on Court One. Up next for Shelton is world number one Jannik Sinner on Sunday. It will be a huge task for the 21-year-old, who has played on five of the six days in the Championships so far. However, Shelton said he is ""really excited"" about facing the Italian and ""always confident in my abilities, no matter who is on the other side of the net"". He has followed in the footsteps of his father and coach Bryan, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon 30 years ago. Resuming from Friday with Shelton leading 3-2 in the first set, both players held firm on their serve to set up a tie-break which the Canadian took. Mistakes from Shelton put him on the back foot but he used an excitable crowd to take the next two sets with some fantastic serving. However, Shapovalov fought back to force Shelton into another deciding set. Buoyed by the American support in the crowd, Shelton produced a host of brilliant forehand winners to book his place in the last 16 in three hours and five minutes. Eight-time men's champion Roger Federer was in attendance on Court One alongside parents Robert and Lynette Elsewhere, fifth seed Daniil Medvedev set up a meeting with 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov after beating German Jan-Lennard Struff 6-1 6-3 4-6 7-6 (7-3). Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard became the fifth lucky loser in the Open era to reach the fourth round with a 4-6 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 win over 87th-ranked Emil Ruusuvuori. Perricard's reward is a meeting with Italian 25th seed Lorenzo Musetti, who beat Argentina's Francisco Comesana 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, who defeated Britain's Cameron Norrie, will face Taylor Fritz in the fourth round after the American 13th seed won 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 7-5 against Chile's Alejandro Tabilo. Fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert defeated American Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (11-9) 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (8-6) and will play defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

The Three Lions' moment of jubilation was made even sweeter for Southgate as he celebrated with supporters following the recent ""difficult personal"" criticism he has faced in Germany. ""Every now and then surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job,"" said the England manager. ""I love the players and sharing that moment with them. ""I can't deny that when it's [the criticism] as personal as it has been in the last few weeks on a human level, that's quite difficult."" England fell behind after 75 minutes, but Bukayo Saka levelled five minutes later to force extra time before victory in the penalty shootout. Southgate told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I took this job to try and improve English football, to give us nights like this.  ""We continue to give people fantastic memories. We will keep enjoying this journey."" England have now reached their third major tournament semi-final under Southgate's management. ""Now we want to deliver one more thing - we have never been to a final outside England, never won a Euros, so there are two bits of history we would love to create,"" he said.

Southgate added that the current group have continued to win in a way previous England teams haven't. ""With England it was often start 25 minutes really well, go ahead in games and then out in the early knockout rounds. We weren't savvy or tournament wise. This group are different. They keep possession for longer periods."" The England boss added that his team have the ""attributes"" of a winning side.

141,Analysis: French people reject the far right  - again,"The French have said it again: they do not want the far right in power. They gave them a big win in the European elections; they gave them a big win in the first round of this parliamentary election. But when it came to a vote that really counted, just as in the presidentials, they drew back from the brink. This surprise upset which has reduced the National Rally (RN) to third place – with perhaps 150 seats compared with predictions a week ago of nearly 300 – is due entirely to voters turning out in large numbers to stop them. The RN will argue – with some justice – that this was only possible because the other parties came together to play the system. They note that the disparate parties of the left all suddenly forgot their differences to form a new anti-RN coalition;  and then that the Macronites and the left forgot their differences too. They note that nothing unites these politicians (from Edouard Philippe on the centre right to Philippe Poutou of the Trotskyist left) except their opposition to the RN.  And that this lack of agreement bodes ill for the future. Nonetheless, the fact remains. Most people do not want the far right – either because they oppose its ideas, or because they fear the unrest that would inevitably attend its coming to power. So if Jordan Bardella will not be the country’s next prime minister, who will be? That is the great unknown. And contrary to convention following previous French parliamentary elections, it may be weeks before we have an answer. Because something has happened these past tense weeks to change the very nature of the French political system.  As Alain Duhamel — veteran of every election since Charles de Gaulle – put it: “Today there is no longer any dominant party. Since Macron came to power seven years ago, we have been in a period of deconstruction of our political forces. “Perhaps now we are beginning a period of reconstruction.” What he means is that there is now a multitude of political forces: three major blocs (left, far-right and centre); plus the centre-right.  And within these there are competing tendencies and parties. With no party able to call the shots in the Assembly, a long period of haggling is now inevitable aimed at forming a new coalition from the centre-right through to the left. It is far from obvious how it will be formed – given the mutual loathing that the different potential components have expressed till now. But we can bet that President Macron will now call for a period of apaisement – conciliation – after the tensions of the last weeks. Conveniently this period will last through the Olympics and the summer holidays, allowing the French to recover their spirits. In the meantime, he will designate somebody to lead the talks and reach out to the different parties. Will it be someone from the left? Will it be someone from the centre?  Will it be a political outsider?  We do not know. What seems certain though is that France is about to enter a more parliamentary system.   Power will drain from President Macron, and towards whoever heads the new government. Even if he manages to place a centrist in the prime ministership (far from easy, given the strength of the left) that person will exercise power in his or her own right, and on the basis of parliamentary support.  Macron – with no prospect of running again in 2027 – will be a diminished figure. So has the president lost his bet?  Is he regretting his haste in calling the elections?  Is he ready to take a backward step? We can be sure that is not the way Macron sees it.  He will be saying that he called the vote because the situation was untenable; that he has clarified politics,  offered the RN a fairer share of Assembly seats, given their widespread support; and  that his gamble that the French would never put the far-right in power was correct. And in the meantime, he has not exactly gone away.  Macron’s power may be on the wane.  But he is still there at the Elysée, consulting with his team, prodding politicians,  still master of the political clock.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrlxn4ngdgo,"Hugh Schofield,",2024-07-07 21:10:24,
140,France's far right 'sad and disappointed' over election result,"The champagne was on ice, the jazz was on low: the scene was set at the pavilion in Paris’s Bois de Vincennes forest where the National Rally (RN) was staging what it hoped would be its victory rally.  Hundreds of journalists had come from across the world, the sniffer dogs in place to protect a party that was, we all thought, at the gates of power; the first time the far right would enter government in France since World War Two. But as time ticked towards the exit poll at 8pm, the mood began to turn. Party apparatchiks talked in hushed tones of indications they had fallen short. Nervous glances were exchanged, the glasses looked more half-empty than half-full. And then the screens told the story: of the National Rally beaten into third place by the left and by President Macron’s centrists. There was stunned silence – and then a smattering of applause by party supporters to try to keep spirits up. “We are sad, disappointed, struck down by this result,” said Rosa Gave, as she clutched a French flag.  “We are victims of a dishonest alliance led by Macron to block us from power.” That ""alliance"" was more of a pact, struck in the last week by opponents of the National Rally - that in many of the three-way races where the RN was in the lead, the third candidate would withdraw, urging voters to rally behind the figure best-placed to stop the far-right. And it worked. It’s a common electoral tactic here – but has still drawn the ire of the RN. As Jordan Bardella, the party’s 28-year-old president – and the man who had hoped to become France’s prime minister – arrived, there were cheers from the dwindling crowd inside.  “Depriving millions of French people of the possibility of seeing their ideas brought to power will never be a viable destiny for France”, he said.  He denounced President Emmanuel Macron for, in his words, pushing France towards instability – and into the arms of what he called the “extreme left”: a reference to France Unbowed, the party leading the victorious left-wing coalition. And then came Marine Le Pen, the National Rally’s leader, whose dream of national power has once again been thwarted at the eleventh hour. She was thronged by journalists, as her supporters chanted “Marine, Présidente!” A couple of reporters were pushed over in the melee.  “The tide is rising – our victory has only been delayed,” she said, calling President Macron’s position “untenable”.  The president who came to power promising to revive the centre ground, to bridge right and left, has done anything but – pushing the French to the extremes. And while many in the National Rally will feel bitterly disappointed that their victory in the first round of this election did not lead them to power after the second, they will be cheering a significant increase in the number of their MPs since the last parliamentary election, confident that one day their time will come. “France has chosen the coalition of the worst,” said Matteo Giammaresi, a National Rally supporter, holding his champagne glass on a rapidly emptying dancefloor.  “What we say now is giving France hope for the future.” The party will now wait this government out, believing that division and disunity will play into Marine Le Pen’s hands. And then, at the 2027 presidential election, she would be able to say - this is what happens when we are blocked from power. What government now emerges is still deeply unclear.  A hung parliament awaits – and potential paralysis. France has been plunged into the political unknown – just not in the way pollsters predicted.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyq3lzvg8o,"Mark Lowen,",2024-07-07 22:22:24,
139,Full report: French left celebrates as far right faces shock defeat,"France's far-right National Rally was widely expected to win this snap election, but projections say they have been beaten into third place. A left-wing alliance called New Popular Front are on course for victory, after a highly charged and abbreviated election called only four weeks ago by a weakened President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally (RN) won the first round of this election, and all the opinion polls since then predicted victory in the run-off round.  Instead, France is heading for a hung parliament with no party having anything like a majority. RN leader Jordan Bardella blamed ""unnatural political alliances"" for stopping their rise to power.  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who was appointed by President Macron only seven months ago, said he would hand in his resignation in the morning, although he pointed out that his Ensemble alliance were on course to win three times the number of seats that had been forecast. That was in part because 217 candidates, mainly from the left alliance and the Macron camp, had dropped out of the race to help their political rivals defeat RN.  Plenty of people were unhappy about it, but it meant that voters who had backed the centre or the left in the first round then pivoted to a rival party a week later, with the single aim of keeping the far right from taking control of parliament. Mr Bardella complained that millions of French voters had been deprived of a response to France's cost of living crisis by what he condemned as ""alliances of dishonour"". ""We don't want power for power's sake, but to hand it to the French people"" Mr Bardella told his supporters.  Party colleague Sébastien Chenu accused the Macron alliance of enabling a left-wing victory, leaving France in a ""quagmire"" conjured up by the president. That alliance has now left France heading for a hung parliament, but also in uncharted territory because the biggest group in the left-wing alliance is led by the radical and abrasive Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose France Unbowed is widely seen as far left by his rivals. A projection for TF1 TV gave France Unbowed (LFI) up to 94 seats, by far the most in his alliance. He was quick to seize the moment, telling his supporters: ""The president's defeat is clear; the president must accept his defeat, the prime minister must go."" A little more than an hour later Mr Attal - unlike President Macron, a highly popular politician - said he would do just that.  In an address from his residence at Hôtel Matignon, he said French voters had rejected the prospect of an extreme government. He praised all the candidates who had withdrawn from the race to stop RN from winning. ""Tomorrow morning I will hand in my resignation,"" he said. ""A new era starts tonight.""  Turning to the millions of voters who backed the far right he added: ""I respect every one of you, because there are no categories of French people who vote right and those of vote wrong."" His fate is now in the president's hands as France needs a stable government during the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July. Mr Attal said he was ready to remain in post ""for as long as duty demands"". But there are few people in the New Popular Front who are happy for him to stay in office. ""The president has the power and the duty to call us, the New Popular Front to govern. We are ready,"" Mr Mélenchon declared. Hastily cobbled together when Mr Macron stunned France with this two-round vote, the alliance includes Greens, Communists and Socialists as well as France Unbowed. Greens leader Marine Tondelier agreed the Popular Front was now ready to govern France: ""We've won and now we're going to govern France."" But she said now was not the time to push for a new prime minister. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ""France has said no to the far right coming to power. The far right made the choice of dividing the French people."" One of France's best-regarded politicians, former Macron prime minister Edouard Philippe, said the election campaign had led to great uncertainty in France.  While a ""crushing majority"" of the French people had said no to RN, they had also not given the left a majority to govern. It was now, he said, up to centrist political forces to seek a deal that would re-establish stability in France after weeks of tensions.

136,Projections show surprise lead for France's left alliance,"A woman holds up an anti-RN placard in Paris reading ""They shall not pass"" There's been a major surprise in France's parliamentary elections, with projections indicating the far-right National Rally (RN) has been beaten into third place because of a tactical pact between the left and the centre.  In the first round a week ago, the RN won the most votes but a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), now appears on course to take the most seats after the second round. President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance is projected to come second. No bloc will have a majority to govern on its own.  It's not clear who'll be the next prime minister but the incumbent from Macron's party, Gabriel Attal, has said he'll resign.  The informal pact saw many leftist or centrist candidates withdraw from run-offs to concentrate the vote against the far right. The hard-left leader of the France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, welcomed the NFP's apparent win as a triumph against the far right and a defeat of Macron's agenda. Mélenchon hailed  what he called a magnificent mobilisation effort. Supporters of the left are holding a victory rally at the Place de la Republique in central Paris.  RN leader Jordan Bardella said an ""alliance of dishonour"" had kept his party from power, throwing France into the arms of the extreme left. The party's former president, Marine Le Pen, said the projected result just delayed its victory. ",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ck7gydwgvy8t,Unknown,Unknown,
137,New foreign secretary wants to reset UK-EU ties,"David Lammy’s whirlwind first trip as foreign secretary, organised at very short notice, is not about instant results or even brave new horizons. It is all about perception - the appearance of a new, vigorous administration, determined to hit the ground running, brimming with goodwill towards some of the UK’s most important partners. After an evening spent with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock - the two found time to watch a few minutes of England’s European Championship quarter-final - Mr Lammy’s tour moved to the bucolic surroundings of the country estate of Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorsky. After a couple of hours of talks, it was back on the plane for a short flight north to one of Nato’s newest members, Sweden. Why Germany, Poland and Sweden? Partly because of Ukraine. Along with Britain, all three countries play important roles in sustaining Kyiv’s war effort. With the new Defence Secretary John Healey on the ground in Odesa, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s government is keen to stress that the UK’s commitment to Ukraine will remain rock solid. Following a meeting with President Zelensky and his counterpart Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, Mr Healey said the UK would provide more artillery guns, a quarter-of-a-million ammunition rounds and nearly 100 precision Brimstone missiles. ""There may have been a change in government, but the UK is united for Ukraine,"" he said, promising to ""reinvigorate"" support via increased military aid. He also pledged to fast-track the reinforcements to ensure they arrive with the next 100 days.  “We want to double down on our commitment to Ukraine,” Mr Lammy said, as dragonflies swooped over a tranquil lake and a pair of majestic eagles circled overhead. France, in the midst of its own election - one which seems destined to have far-reaching consequences - was not on the itinerary. Not this weekend. No stop in Brussels, either. Sir Keir has said the UK will not return to the EU “in my lifetime”. But Poland and Sweden are both key European partners and fellow Nato members - good places for the foreign secretary to start exploring the outlines of closer future relations. “I want to reset both our bilateral relationship and our relationship with the European Union,” Mr Lammy said, adding a reference to Labour’s still rather nebulous pledge to strike a new EU-UK security pact. Meanwhile, on a visit to Edinburgh on Sunday, the prime minister said work was already under way to improve the UK's relationship with the EU. He said his government ""can get a much better deal than the botched deal that Boris Johnson saddled the UK with"". Mr Lammy said that when European leaders gather at Blenheim Palace on 18 July for the next meeting of the European Political Community (established by Emmanuel Macron in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), “the new spirit of co-operation will be on show”. The trip comes just days before Sir Keir takes his own first steps on the international stage as prime minister, at the Nato summit in Washington DC. These are tricky times to be shoring up relationships, with France taking a lurch to the right and the US possibly on the verge of returning the unpredictable Donald Trump to office. Mr Lammy agreed this was a “tough geopolitical moment”, but said it was important not to confuse disagreements between mature democracies with the threats posed by authoritarian regimes. “I am concerned when I see Iranian drones turning up in Ukraine,” he said.  “I am concerned when I see shells from North Korea being used here on European soil.  ""And of course I'm concerned with the partnership that I see Russia brokering across those authoritarian states.” Other issues hang heavy over the new foreign secretary’s first trip, in particular the war in Gaza. In Germany on Saturday, Mr Lammy spoke to the need to strike a “more balanced approach to Israel-Gaza”. It is not clear exactly what he meant, but with ceasefire talks apparently poised to resume, finding a way to end the Gaza war and revive the Arab-Israeli peace process seems destined to consume a large amount of diplomatic time in the coming months. For his part, Mr Lammy’s famously anglophile host said the relatively new Polish government shared something in common with the incoming Starmer administration. Both, Mr Sikorski said, were “the product of the public being tired with enthusiasts on the nationalist side of politics” - a remark which perhaps only partially reflected the true nature of last week’s general election. Mr Sikorski said he looked forward to “a more pragmatic approach” from Britain to its relationship with Europe and said the two ministers had discussed “some creative ideas of how to further that”.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4wypn23wo,"Paul Adams,",2024-07-07 21:10:24,
138,Democrats weigh risks and rewards of losing Biden,"President Joe Biden sought to revive his beleaguered re-election effort on Sunday, as members of his party debated the future of his candidacy. The president's halting debate performance last week raised serious questions about his physical and mental capacity to run. A prime time interview with ABC on Friday fuelled further speculation about his campaign's future.  Amid the uncertainty, Mr Biden appeared at two campaign events in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, on Sunday. But those efforts have not stopped the president's fellow Democrats from weighing the risks and rewards of keeping Mr Biden, 81, at the top of the ticket. On Sunday afternoon, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries convened a meeting with ranking Democratic lawmakers that reportedly included discussion of Mr Biden's candidacy. Four of those on the call said they thought Biden should drop out, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. Sources said at least three others expressed concern about his chances in November. A number of top Democratic figures also voiced their stances in televised interviews over the weekend, aiming to address the question: is it riskier to stick with Mr Biden or to leave him behind? Some say the party could be headed to defeat against Donald Trump in November if Mr Biden stays on, but others say replacing him comes with many unknowns.  Amid the fallout of Mr Biden's disastrous debate performance, asking the president to step aside could bring some immediate relief. Some Democrats, including avowed supporters of the president, have said as much, suggesting that concerns about his age and mental acuity had grown difficult to overcome.  The debate ""rightfully raised questions among the American people about whether the president has the vigour to defeat Donald Trump"", said California Representative Adam Schiff on Sunday.  Mr Schiff stopped short of saying Biden should drop out in his interview with NBC News - a position taken publicly by five House Democrats so far.  Instead, Mr Schiff urged him to seek advice from people with “distance and objectivity” and make a decision about whether he believes he is the best candidate to run. ""Given Joe Biden's incredible record, given Donald Trump's terrible record, he [Biden] should be mopping the floor with Donald Trump,"" Mr Schiff said. ""It should not be even close and there's only one reason it is close, and that's the president's age.""  Mr Biden is 81, while Trump has just turned 78. The ages of both candidates have become an increasingly contentious point among voters. On the left, polls suggest some voters are losing faith in Mr Biden. In a Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, 86% of Democrats said they would support Mr Biden, down from 93% in February. A different candidate may also offer a clean slate in other areas, too. Before this wave of Democratic panic, Mr Biden drew criticism from voters on several policy fronts, including his handling of the US economy and the migrant crisis at the country's southern border.    The president faced a threat of defection from progressive voters who oppose his response to Israel's war in Gaza. Their resistance cost him more than 100,000 votes in Michigan - a crucial swing state - during its primary in February.  A Biden ticket ""is going to drag everybody else down"", said former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan on Sunday in an interview with Fox News. ""I think you're going to see a significant amount of pressure whether it's today or tomorrow, sometime this week, as members come back that this may be untenable for them.""  Any benefit to losing Mr Biden may be muted by the looming risks, according to some Democratic leaders.  If the president stood aside, most of what comes after remains unclear: who would replace Mr Biden, and how? And how would that candidate fare against Trump?  And in recent days, several Biden allies have stressed the pitfalls of charting a new course, arguing that Mr Biden has been a proven success.   ""Biden is old,"" said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, on CBS News on Sunday. ""He is not as articulate as he once was. I wish he could jump up the steps on Air Force One. He can't. What we have got to focus on is policy - whose policies have and will benefit the vast majority of the people in this country.""  California Governor Gavin Newsom, who spent the weekend stumping for the president, said the same at a rally in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on Saturday.  “It’s the hypothetical that gets in the way of progress in terms of promoting this candidacy,” Mr Newsom said. “It’s exactly where the other party wants us to be, is having this internal fight, and I think it’s extraordinarily unhelpful.” Mr Biden's public supporters say replacing him may become a direct benefit to Trump's Republicans, who can argue their opponents are engulfed in party chaos.  ""We've got to stop talking about this,"" Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said on CNN on Sunday. ""We've spent a whole week. Republicans are having a great time. I mean, we need to get back to talking about Donald Trump and his performance.""  Earlier this week, former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan put forward a potential replacement: Mr Biden's Vice-president Kamala Harris.  ""I strongly believe that our best path forward is Kamala Harris,"" he wrote in a op-ed for Newsweek. ""Those who say that a Harris candidacy is a greater risk than the Joe Biden we saw the other night and will continue to see are not living in reality."" Though she has demonstrated only loyal support to Mr Biden, the idea of Ms Harris, 59, stepping in for Mr Biden has gained traction in recent days.  In Adam Schiff's Sunday morning interview, the congressman said Ms Harris could win against Trump ""overwhelmingly"".  As vice-president, and a 2020 Democratic contender, supporters say she is already campaign-tested and familiar to the Democratic establishment and its fundraisers.  Ms Harris ""knows the job"", said former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile on ABC on Sunday. ""To ask the delegates elected to the convention who are Biden-Harris supporters to bypass Kamala Harris... it would be political malpractice.""  But what makes her attractive to supporters could also be a catch: age isn't voters' only complaint against Biden and the administration's baggage surrounding policy choices could extend to Ms Harris.

135,What is the New Popular Front and who will be PM of a divided assembly?,"The New Popular Front is an alliance of Socialists, Ecologists, Communists and France Unbowed (LFI) formed after President Macron called a snap parliamentary election on 9 June. These parties have previously criticised one another and have some key differences in their ideology and approach. But they decided to form a bloc to keep the far right out of government. The NPF has promised to scrap the pension and immigration reforms passed by the current government, to set up a rescue agency for undocumented migrants and to facilitate visa applications. It also wants to put caps on basic goods to combat the cost of living crisis and raise the minimum wage. There was rejoicing at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) in the left-wing camp when the projections were published. Against every expectation the National Rally had fallen from a clear first place in round one a week ago, to third place in round two. It now looks set to secure - at most - 150 seats in the assembly, some way behind the New Popular Front on the left and supporters of President Macron in the centre. It seems the calls from all the other parties to block the far-right’s coming to government have worked very effectively: Jordan Bardella will not be the next French prime minister. Who will be is another matter. The fact is that none of the three big blocs has an outright majority in the Assembly. What beckons therefore is a period of haggling over an eventual coalition forming around a programme still undefined. The left – flush from their strong performance – will expect a very strong voice. LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has said Prime Minister Gabriel Attal should resign and stated the NPF is ready to govern France.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd910je22no,Unknown,2024-07-07 19:10:24,
142,Rob Delaney says he wants to die in same room as his son,"The US actor and comedian Rob Delaney has said he wants to buy the home his son died in so he can also experience his last moments there. Delaney's two-year-old child Henry died in 2018 after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.  Delaney told Radio 4's Desert Island Discs he asked the landlord when he moved out: ""Listen, if you ever go to sell this place, let me know first because I would like to buy it. ""So when I'm 81 I can crawl in here and die. In the same room that my son died in, that my other son was born in."" Before Henry died, his parents told him they were expecting another child.  The Catastrophe and Deadpool 2 star said: ""He had to know that this family that loved him was alive and was growing and that there was somebody that we were going to tell about him. ""We knew that they would not overlap corporally on this Earth, even though Henry's younger brother was born in the same room that Henry died in, our living room."" Delaney, 47, told the programme that he and his wife, Leah, had considered leaving London but had continued to live in the city because of memories of Henry. ""For so many reasons, we've stayed, one of which is I like to go put my hands on slides at the playground that Henry slid down."" He added that he sometimes bumps into the nurses that looked after his son and said London and the NHS had taken very good care of his child. Delaney has previously described the NHS as ""the pinnacle of human achievement"" and that his family received ""truly unbelievable"" care while Henry was sick.  Delaney thought he would struggle with the birth of his new son, saying his heart had ""been torn into pieces and dissolved in salt"" and was just ""garbage"". But he told host Lauren Laverne that the ""nanosecond he exited my wife's body, I looked at him and just you know, started weeping and was so in love with him and just wanted to sniff them and eat them and put them into my shirt and squeeze them and I love him desperately. ""And then you have to feel and honour your pain. You have to let it hurt and you can't run away from it. When the feelings come it's best to let them."" Delaney also spoke about his recovery from alcoholism, saying he has been sober for more than two decades after a car crash prompted him to stop drinking.  He added: ""It's nothing more interesting than garden variety alcoholism, you know, I found that drinking just made me just feel better, complete, happier, relaxed. ""You know, anytime I took a drink, it was just like, 'this is it'. I first got drunk at 12 and then began to drink with more regularity at 14. ""I had alcoholism on both sides of my family.

143,"After Covid and Olympics, Tokyo’s first female governor set for third term","Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike is certain to win a third consecutive term in Sunday's gubernatorial election, according to exit polls. The 71-year-old first female governor of Japan's most populous city, will secure her position for another four years. Her victory will be a relief for struggling Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who backed the 71-year-old to win a third term. She was elected  in 2016, and won her second term in 2020. The conservative governor successfully guided the city through the coronavirus pandemic and its delayed summer Olympics in 2021. Japan’s tumbling fertility became a major issue during this campaign, and the victorious candidate will now have to work hard to improve Tokyo’s shockingly low birth rate. At 0.99 - less than one child per woman aged between 15 and 49 - it is the lowest of any region nationwide. Her appointment makes her one of the most powerful women in Japan's male dominated politics – with Tokyo accounting for about 11% of the population and contributing to nearly 20% of the country’s total GDP. It also puts her in charge of the city’s budget – which climbed to a staggering 16.55 trillion yen ($100bn; £80bn) this fiscal year. Ms Koike, 71, got more than 40% of the vote according to Reuters.   Declaring victory, Ms Koike said her main challenge was ""how to proceed with digital transformation as industries have changed significantly."" She said she would consolidate efforts to keep improving Tokyo, including ""the environment for women's empowerment"", which she said was ""insufficient [in Japan] compared to other parts of the world.""  Unexpectedly, Shinji Ishimaru, 41, an independent candidate and the former mayor of Akitakata, a town in Hiroshima prefecture, placed second, a position that was long thought to be guaranteed for Renho Saito.  Ms Renho, 56, supported by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), came in third. Mr Ishimaru, was relatively unknown in Tokyo before the official campaign began. During the election campaign, he focused on boosting his profile by reaching out to his large social media following. Mr Ishimaru's success is thought to be down to his appeal among young voters. As a former banker, he also focused on advancing the economy and industry of Tokyo.  After the polls closed, he told his supporters, ""I did all I could"", alluding to the fact that he had no particular party affiliation, unlike the two main contenders.   Yuriko Koike started her career as a journalist, working as a television news anchor before moving into politics in the early 1990s. But it was not until 2016 that she came to true national prominence after winning the governorship of Tokyo for the first time. She was not the official candidate of LDP, but still managed to win comfortably, taking more than 2.9 million votes to become the first woman in the role. ""I will lead Tokyo politics in an unprecedented manner, a Tokyo you have never seen,"" Ms Koike promised supporters on election night. She officially left the LDP in 2017 to set up her own political party, though she retains the support of many in the party – who gave her their backing in the 2024 race. Ms Koike vowed to focus on local issues during her term, including tackling overcrowding on public transport, as well as the culture of overworking in the city. But it was global issues that came to dominate her time in office. The emergence of Covid-19 forced Tokyo to delay its summer Olympics, planned for 2020. Ms Koike won a second term that year after her successful handling of the pandemic, and garnered further praise for managing the delayed Olympics, held in the city in 2021 in the shadow of the coronavirus. Ms Koike, however has not escaped scandal. An allegation that she never graduated from Cairo University – first reported during her first term – has never quite died away. Despite repeated denials from her and a statement confirming her graduation from the university itself, reports that she falsified her graduation documents still persisted during her try at a third gubernatorial term. Opponents also criticised her for failing to follow through on her pledges in Tokyo. The trains remain overcrowded and overwork culture remains a problem, they say. Of the 56 candidates the voters had to choose from, it had been expected Renho Saito would be Ms Koike's main opponent.  The former upper house member was backed by the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, as well as the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. Ms Renho left the CDP before official campaigning started on June 20. She lost her Upper House seat when she filed her candidacy. She rose to lead the centre-left group in 2016 as its first ever female head, but resigned a year later over poor results in Tokyo’s prefectural election. Japanese media projected the race as a proxy war between national parties, as the conservative incumbent was challenged by the left-leaning opposition politician.  The gubernatorial election also took place amid a climate of general mistrust towards politics. Critics say this is linked in part to the economic difficulties of the Japanese followed by an end of the long historical period of deflation, and the weakening of the yen.",2024-07-07 23:10:25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5gjjw20zo,"Toby Luckhurst,",2024-07-07 14:10:25,
144,Titanic and Avatar producer Jon Landau dies aged 63,"Jon Landau - the Oscar-winning producer of some of the world's highest-grossing movies of all time, including Titanic and Avatar - has died aged 63. Landau, who was the long-time producing partner of filmmaker James Cameron, reportedly died on Friday after living with cancer for more than a year. His sister Tina confirmed his death on social media, calling him ""the best brother a girl could ever dream of"". ""My heart is broken but also bursting with pride & gratitude for his most extraordinary life, and the love and gifts he gave me - and all who knew him or his films,"" she wrote.  Landau was the son of Hollywood producers Ely and Edie Landau and for a time was an executive at the film production company 20th Century Fox, overseeing films including The Last Of The Mohicans and Die Hard 2. Alongside Cameron, he helped to create the 1997 hit Titanic, which was the first film to make it past the $1bn mark at the global box office. Later films Avatar and its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water, which were released in 2009 and 2022 respectively, went on to break Titanic's record.  Landau also co-produced other hit films including Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Dick Tracy, and held a management position in Cameron's production company Lightstorm Entertainment.   Following news of Landau's death, Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter that ""a great producer and a great human being has left us"".  ""Jon Landau believed in the dream of cinema. He believed that film is the ultimate human art form, and to make films you have to first be human yourself,"" he said.  ""He will be remembered as much for his vast generosity of spirit as for the movies themselves.” Director Sir Peter Jackson and his screenwriter wife Fran Walsh, whose visual effects company was used for the Avatar films, said in a statement that they were ""devastated by the loss of Jon Landau"". ""Jon brought unparalleled passion to the projects he worked on and his influence will continue to inspire for years to come."" The actor Zoe Saldaña, who starred in the Avatar films, wrote a message to Landau on Instagram, saying that his death was ""hitting really hard"".

145,Are deep shifts in UK Muslim and Jewish voting here to stay?,"However big the headline change in the vote between the past two elections, drill down into two demographic pockets of Britain and you find staggering shifts. It all centres around the relationships between the Labour Party and not just Muslim voters, but Jewish voters too. It leaves a party in government that has made progress in winning back trust among people from one faith group while suddenly finding itself with a lot of work to do to win back many members of the other. The drop in the Labour vote share among British Muslims between 2019 and 2024 very obviously played out in several constituencies. This happened most dramatically in Leicester South, with a Muslim population close to 30%, where Shadow Paymaster General Jon Ashworth lost his seat to independent Shockat Adam. In the seat of Dewsbury and Batley, in Birmingham Perry Barr and in Blackburn, there were wins for independents in what had been safe Labour seats with large numbers of Muslim voters. In places like Bradford West and the seat of Bethnal Green and Stepney in east London, sitting Labour MPs clung on with startling reductions in their majorities. Mish Rahman, from Walsall, is not just any Muslim voter. He currently sits on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, a body of fewer than 40 members. He is furious with the party’s response to the killing of tens of thousands of people in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there. “In my community it has got to the point where I am now embarrassed about my affiliation with Labour,” he says. “It was hard even to tell members of my own extended family to go and knock on doors to tell people to vote for a party that originally gave Israel carte blanche in its response to the horrific 7 October attacks,” says Mr Rahman. He lays the blame for the decline in Muslim voting for Labour squarely at the door of the Labour leader. Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by many in his party, including councillors, for an interview with LBC in October in which he suggested that Israel “had the right” to withhold power and water in Gaza. His spokesman subsequently suggested the Labour leader had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. Then when Labour MPs were told by the party leadership in November to abstain from voting on an SNP-led motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, some Labour councillors resigned and, for many Muslims, trust in their Labour MP was lost. Faith communities are far from homogenous, of course. There are myriad factors that govern how a person will cast their vote, but faith does throw up a unique set of considerations that plays out in broad voting patterns. Muslims are estimated to form around 6.5% of the population of England and Wales, with around 2% in Scotland and 1% in Northern Ireland. Well over 80% of Muslims are believed to have voted for Labour in 2019. Research just ahead of the 2024 election suggested that had dropped nationally by up to 20 percentage points, and in some constituencies the Muslim vote for Labour clearly fell further. The contrast with Jewish voting data could not be more stark. In 2019, the proportion of British Jews (about 0.5% of the population) who voted for a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is thought to have collapsed to just single figures. Research suggests that figure could have climbed back to above 40%. “What we have seen is a huge bounce-back for Labour among Jewish voters,” says Adam Langleben, who was until recently the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement. Mr Langleben, a former Labour councillor and now director of Progressive Britain (formerly Progress), points to Labour wins in London in the Finchley and Golders Green seat and also Hendon as well as Bury South in Greater Manchester, all constituencies with large Jewish populations. “Jewish voters returning to the party has undoubtedly delivered seats to the Labour Party,” says Mr Langleben. “You don’t need a majority of Jewish voters to win in these constituencies, but you also can’t only have 7% of them voting for you and expect to win,” he says. Mr Langleben had been a senior member of the Jewish Labour Movement but was one of many Jewish members of the party to give up their membership during the Corbyn era. When he left in 2019, he said it was on account of the party being “led by antisemites”, an accusation always strongly denied by those leading the party at the time. “It was a situation that was all-consuming. I would be canvassing for the Labour Party in a Jewish area and had people in tears on the doorstep saying there was no way they could vote for Jeremy Corbyn, and I was trying to juggle this huge personal tension,” he says. Mr Langleben puts Mr Corbyn’s problems down to both a lack of personal reflection about who he was associating with, and what he says was the party’s inability to deal with extreme elements in its base and tolerance of the use of antisemitic tropes. “From day one, Keir Starmer pledged to work with the Jewish community to try to deal with the issues inside the Labour Party. For him, fixing what went wrong was a personal mission,” he says. But given that Keir Starmer supported Jeremy Corbyn throughout his leadership, Jewish voters at hustings in synagogues and community centres around the country had been grilling Labour candidates as to why they should trust the current leader now. “The Jewish vote is now split and that’s how it should be. The results show there wasn’t a dominant party of choice, and that’s healthy, and still represents a huge transformation for Labour,” says Mr Langleben. So while mistrust clearly still remains, what is responsible for the transformation in the perception of the Labour Party among some British Jews? The fact that the current leadership’s criticism of Israel’s response to the 7 October attacks has been more tempered than it may have been under the previous leadership may have contributed. But long before that, Mr Langleben cites a change in the way complaints around “protected characteristics” like faith are dealt with by the party, but also refers to one thing that convinced him he was right to re-join the party. “The fundamental moment was Jeremy Corbyn being suspended from the Labour Party and then subsequently having the whip removed, because it showed Keir Starmer’s determination and his willingness to take on parts of the party that previously he had not been willing to take on,” he says. Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension is precisely identified by Mr Rahman too as the first major showdown between different wings of the party under Keir Starmer. Except, as someone who had been inspired by Mr Corbyn from the days of Stop the War protests in the lead-up to the UK-backed invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr Rahman was on the other side, saying that was the moment when the alarm bells started ringing for him that the party leaders were not safeguarding the values he believed in. Mr Rahman does not see the party’s anti-Muslim slant as being limited to its response to events in Gaza. He does not question there have been serious cases of antisemitism but does not believe all accusations of racism are treated equally. “There is a clear hierarchy of racism in the Labour Party. Some instances of racism, including Islamophobia, aren't taken as seriously as they should,” he says. Mr Rahman cites the case of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the EHRC, who was suspended for alleged Islamophobia. Mr Phillips had said British Muslims were “a nation within a nation” and previously that their opinion was “some distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else’s”, though later he suggested this had not necessarily been meant as a criticism. Mr Phillips was readmitted to the party in 2021 without it going to a panel inquiry. Mr Rahman, like many other Muslims, also points to Keir Starmer’s own comments, like those made in a Sun livestream during the election campaign, when he talked of migrants being sent back to the countries they came from. “At the moment, people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed because they’re not being processed,” the Labour leader said. “Can you imagine the Labour Party saying that about people of any other ethnicity? Saying they're going to deport people to Israel or Ukraine or Hong Kong? It wouldn’t happen and neither should it,” says Mr Rahman. Such is his disenchantment with Labour’s response that, coupled with wider concerns regarding the treatment of Muslims, he lays a serious charge against the party. “I don’t doubt for a minute that Labour is currently institutionally Islamophobic,” says Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman wants to use his voice to call out hypocrisy in the party while in government, in the hope that it will learn what he says is a lesson of this election - that no voter can be taken for granted. Mr Rahman did give up his membership of the Labour Party once before, in protest at Tony Blair’s role in the Iraq War. He, and other Muslims, felt persuaded to come back to the party in 2014 when the then-leader Ed Miliband condemned the scale of an Israeli operation in Gaza and the hundreds of civilian deaths. Once again, at the same moment, Mr Langleben was seeing things very differently on the doorsteps of Jewish voters. Even though Mr Miliband was himself Jewish, it was a time when polls were showing a rapid decline in Jewish support for Labour, particularly when the party’s 2015 manifesto talked about a parliamentary vote to recognise a Palestinian state. “There were sometimes quite horrible conversations with Jewish voters who really cared about the issue of Israel,” says Mr Langleben. “People in 2015 were accusing the Labour Party of antisemitism, but I think it fundamentally misread what antisemitism is. Then, it was a primarily about a foreign policy issue, Israel. That changed by 2019 when conversations were around a particular strain of far-left anti-Jewish racism,” says Mr Langleben. For some of those supportive of the Corbyn-era leadership, that sense that criticism of Israel was being conflated with antisemitism was also something they felt occurred while he was leader. The Hamas attacks of the 7 October 2023 happened during the week of the Labour Party conference and Mr Langleben says it was strange to see normal political business go on while he and other Jewish delegates were going through a difficult and upsetting period. Ultimately, Mr Langleben says he has been pleased with the way Keir Starmer has handled the crisis, seeing it as Labour realigning itself with UK and US government policy on Israel. This is precisely why during this election campaign, Mr Rahman had the hardest conversations on the doorsteps of Muslim voters he had ever had, with anger and frustration boiling over about Israel’s actions in Gaza. “If you look back at the history of the relationship between our communities and the Labour Party, it's always been a one-sided affair of loyalty from our communities,” Mr Rahman says. The Labour Party’s roots in his own family go back to his grandfather, who was a factory worker in the 1950s and 60s. Mr Rahman talks of feeling “betrayed”. Gaza of course is not just a Muslim issue, and not all Muslims ranked it is one of the key considerations on which they voted, but it had an impact. Similarly, Israel policy is not necessarily a major consideration for all Jewish voters, and even for those for whom it is, there are those who are highly critical of the Israeli government and are at odds with the response of Labour under Starmer. But while over the decades the Jewish vote has swung between the two main parties broadly in line with the general population, it would appear that if one puts to one side all of the rows over antisemitism, the party’s outlook on Israel does impact voting intention. Separately, both Mish Rahman and Adam Langleben are very clear that their accusations of discrimination levelled at the party in different eras do not just relate to party policy on the Middle East. Even if everyone can be satisfied that accusations of discrimination are dealt with equally, such are the modern tensions around Middle East policy that political parties may struggle to find a position that does not alienate some members of one of these faith communities. Labour has achieved much in winning back the levels of Jewish voters it has, but it has also left huge swathes of loyal Muslim voters in Britain feeling politically adrift, and large swings in culture and policy over recent years leave many in each community needing convincing of the true nature of the party.

148,Senior Hamas official killed as Israel orders fresh evacuation,"A senior Hamas administration official was among four people killed in an Israeli air strike at a school in Gaza City, Palestinian sources say. A local official told the BBC that Ehab Al-Ghussein was appointed to manage the affairs of the Hamas government in Gaza City and northern Gaza three months ago. The Israeli army says that it carried out a strike on the area of a school building in Gaza City from which it says ""terrorists were operating and hiding"". It says that it took steps to minimise the risk of civilians being harmed. Eyewitnesses say the attack targeted the Holy Family School next to the Holy Family Church to the west of Gaza city. A large number of people were sheltering in the building, the BBC understands. The air strike targeted two classrooms on the ground floor, they said. Ehab Al-Ghussein was formerly deputy labour minister in the Hamas administration and before that an interior ministry spokesman. His death is not considered to be a blow to Hamas militarily, but he was considered a significant figure in the leadership of the Hamas administration. Many others in the Hamas administration have been killed in the past nine months. In one Israeli airstrike last November, the deputy culture minister and the deputy speaker of the legislative council were killed, along with other government employees and officials, as well as senior police officers. Separately the Israeli military issued another evacuation order for a central part of Gaza City. Ibrahim Al-Barbari, 47, who lives with his wife, five children, mother and sister in the Bani Amer neighbourhood, told the BBC that dozens of families were leaving and women and children were carrying bags and heading west. “We heard from the neighbours that we had to leave the house. We haven’t received any calls or texts from the army, but we have already started gathering our belongings in preparation for moving again.  ""We have been living in a state of near famine for months."" Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that any ceasefire deal in Gaza must allow Israel to resume fighting afterwards, until its objectives are met.  He has previously defined these as dismantling Hamas's military and governing capabilities, as well as returning hostages.  Hamas officials say they are awaiting Israel's response to the latest ceasefire proposals. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-07 23:10:25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93qvvzzx0o,"Sebastian Usher and Rushdi Abualouf,",2024-07-07 20:10:25,
151,Scammed by the fake Chinese police,"Chinese people around the world are being targeted by an elaborate scam in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police. A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station. Helen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China’s most wanted list. Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her £29,000 life savings as “bail money”, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. “I feel a bit stupid right now,” she says. “But there's no chance I can know that's not real. It's so convincing”. Helen’s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. China’s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams, as has the FBI after a number of cases in the US. One elderly woman in Los Angeles reportedly handed over $3m, believing it would stop her extradition. Typically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call. In Helen’s case it was somebody claiming to be a Chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name. Helen hadn’t sent anything, and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity. Although she was sceptical, Helen didn’t hang up. “Chinese people like myself because we were born and bred in China, we were taught obedience,” she says. “So when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it’s very rare that I will say no.” Helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in Shenzhen called “Officer Fang”. Helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call. When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed. Officer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo. “That moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',” Helen says. While they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her. Officer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.  “I said: 'That’s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they’re guilty. So it’s the evidence that counts'.” Helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison “He said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.” The scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night. Over the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life. Then Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her. Helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud. We have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it’s impossible to tell if what you’re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim. But for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: “After I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.” Helen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she’s a British citizen. “He told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.” Helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer £29,000. “I felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,” Helen says. But a few days later the fake police were back. Helen was ordered to find another £250,000 or be extradited: “I was fighting for my life - if I go back to China, I may never come back.” After Helen tried to borrow the money from a friend, he alerted her daughter. Helen broke down and revealed everything. But not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom, and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn’t listen in.  Her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam. Helen’s bank eventually refunded her money, but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending: “For two weeks I hardly slept. How can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone?""  In her sleep-deprived state, she crashed her car twice. On the second occasion, she wrecked it entirely: “I didn’t kill anyone, but I could have. These types of criminal scam could kill people.” Other victims of police impersonation scams have been pushed to even greater extremes.  In some extraordinary cases, some Chinese foreign students who can’t meet the financial demands of the fake police have been persuaded to fake their own kidnappings in order to seek a ransom from their families. Detective Superintendent Joe Doueihi of New South Wales Police fronted a publicity campaign to warn about so-called virtual or cyber-kidnappings, after a series of cases in Australia. “Victims are coerced into making their own video of them being in a vulnerable position, to appear as if they've been kidnapped - tied up with tomato sauce on their body to make it look like they've been bleeding, and calling for help from their loved ones,” he says. The students are then ordered to isolate themselves while the scammers send these images to families back in China, with a ransom demand. The scam victims may also find themselves being manipulated into helping to scam others. “Scammers will trick a victim into believing that they are working for the Chinese government. They will send them documentation and swear them in as a Chinese police officer,” Det Supt Doueihi says. He says the victim - who may have already handed over money to the criminals - is sent to monitor or intimidate other Chinese students in Australia. Many of these frauds are thought by experts to be run by Chinese organised crime groups operating from compounds in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. Chinese state media has reported that tens of thousands of suspects have been returned to China over the last year. Awareness of these types of scams is growing. We spoke to a student in Japan who realised he was being targeted by criminals, and recorded their conversation. He asked not to be named, but shared the recording with the BBC. In it, the scammers tell him that if he revealed anything about the call to anyone, then he would be jeopardising the ""investigation"". He refused to hand over any money and they stopped pursuing him. He’s aware that he had a lucky escape: ""I never thought it would happen to me. Just be really careful when you get a call from  a number that you don't recognise.” Additional reporting by Yi Ma  For more on this story: Watch  BBC Trending: Scammed by the fake Chinese Police – now on YouTube BBC World Service tells the story of scammers posing as Chinese police.",2024-07-07 23:10:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2lq0qk41o,"Elaine Chong and Ed Main,",2024-07-07 00:10:26,
153,"Project 2025: A wish list for a Trump presidency, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April 2023, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  Early this July, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted the Biden campaign to accuse Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have refocused attention on Project 2025. It is common for Washington think-tanks to propose policy wishlists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency.  In early July, Trump said on his social media platform that he knows ""nothing about Project 2025”.  “I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,"" he wrote.  ""Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them."" However, several people linked to the project worked in Trump's administration or as allies in his re-election campaign.  The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. Jared Huffman, a Democrat congressman from California, has launched a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. He described Project 2025 as ""a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions"". Mr Huffman said the project would ""abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in early June.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. In his speeches and on his website, Trump has endorsed a number of ideas included in Project 2025, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-07 23:10:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-07 20:10:26,
152,The far right came close to power in France. What about the rest of Europe?,"How likely is France to wake up on Monday morning to a new far-right dawn? That was the garishly painted, hotly debated scenario in media headlines, the EU in Brussels and seats of government across Europe following the first round of France’s parliamentary vote. But despite the spectacular showing by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party last week, the RN has failed to achieve a majority. French centrist and leftist parties strategically withdrew candidates to bolster each other’s contenders ahead of Sunday’s decisive second round. But the impact of this election will be seismic, as the RN is still expected to greatly increase its representation in parliament. That means a decades-old taboo will have been shattered in France, a core EU nation. The EU was born out of the ashes of World War Two. It was originally designed as a peace project, with wartime enemies, France and Germany, at its core. Far-right parties were banished to the outer fringes of European politics. Last month, world leaders gathered in northern France to mark 80 years since D-Day, the allied amphibious assault in Normandy that helped secure the defeat of Nazi Germany. But now, “far-right” or “hard-right” or “populist nationalist” parties are part of coalition governments in a number of EU countries, including the Netherlands, Italy and Finland. There are challenges in labelling these parties. Their policies frequently change. They also vary from country to country. And their normalisation is not an entirely new phenomenon. Former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, a centre-right politician, was the first EU leader to take the plunge. He formed a government with the post-fascist political group, Movimento Sociale Italiano, back in 1994. Six years later, Austria’s conservatives went into coalition with the far-right Freedom Party. At the time, the EU was so outraged that it blocked official bilateral contacts with Austria for several months. Post-war political etiquette dictated the political mainstream must form a cordon sanitaire, a “health barrier”, at election time to keep the extreme right out of European governments. The universally recognised term for that practice is French, which gives you a sense how passionately many in France felt about it. In the 2002 Presidential election, some French voters clipped a clothes peg to their noses on their way to polling stations - a way of showing they’d vote for a candidate they didn’t really like, just  to keep out the far right. This was a far right that for years was led by Marine Le Pen’s father, with French former members of a Nazi-led Waffen SS unit in his party ranks. Fast-forward to 2024, and Marine Le Pen’s ambition, 10 years in the making, to detoxify her father’s party – changing its name and trying hard to clean up its image - appears to have been a roaring success. The cordon sanitaire now has a searing gash in it, after the leader of France’s centre-right Les Républicains struck a deal with the RN not to compete against each other this Sunday in specific constituencies. This was an earthquake in French politics. Crucially for Marine Le Pen, those who support her aren’t embarrassed to admit it any more. The RN is no longer viewed as an extremist protest movement. For many, it offers a credible political programme, whatever its detractors claim. French voters trust the RN more than any other party to manage their economy and (currently poor) public finances, according to an Ipsos poll for the Financial Times newspaper. This is despite the party’s lack of government experience and its largely unfunded tax-cutting and spending plans. Which begs the question, when you observe the angst-ridden despair in liberal circles in Europe at the growing success of the so-called “New Right”: if traditional lawmakers had served their electorates better, perhaps there’d be less of an opening for European populists to walk into? By populists, I mean politicians like Ms Le Pen who claim to listen to and speak on behalf of “ordinary people”, defending them against “the establishment”. This “them and us” argument is extremely effective when voters feel anxious and ignored by governing powers. Just look at Donald Trump in the US, the sudden unexpected breakthrough of Reform UK in Thursday’s UK election and the huge success of Germany’s controversial anti-migration AfD party. In France, many perceive President Macron - a former merchant banker - as arrogant, privileged and remote from the everyday cares of ordinary people outside the Paris bubble. A man who made difficult lives even tougher, they say, by raising the national pension age and trying to put up fuel prices, citing environmental concerns. It must be a source of frustration for France’s president that his success at lowering unemployment rates and the billions of euros he spent trying to soften the economic effects of the Covid and energy crises seem largely forgotten. Meanwhile, the RN concentrated much of its campaign on the cost-of-living crisis. The party has pledged to cut taxes on gas and electricity and to raise the minimum wage for low earners. Priorities like these mean the RN should no longer be labelled a far-right movement, its supporters insist. They point to a widening support base and say the party shouldn’t be forever tarnished by its racist roots under Le Pen senior. A similar argument echoes out of Rome. Italy’s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, once used to praise fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Her Brothers of Italy party has post-fascist roots but she now heads one of the EU’s most stable governments. She recently censured a meeting of her party’s youth wing. Members had been filmed giving fascist salutes. There was no room in her party for nostalgia for the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century, she said. While critics at home warn of attempts to influence Italy’s media landscape and Ms Meloni’s attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, her concrete proposals to tackle irregular migration have won plaudits from the European mainstream, including the EU Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, and the UK’s recently ousted prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Frankly, on hot-button issues like migration, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the political rhetoric of the far right in Europe and traditional mainstream politicians intentionally sharpening their speeches to try to hold on to voters. Former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was a prime example of this, and Emmanuel Macron too, the more he’s felt the heat of Marine Le Pen’s popularity. One of the inadvertent effects of mainstream politicians aping parties further to their right on migration is that it makes the original anti-immigration parties seem more respectable, acceptable and electable.  Witness the recent stellar performance in the Netherlands’ general election of anti-migration politician Geert Wilders, who has been regularly accused of hate speech. The label “far right” is one that needs to be debated. Much depends on the make-up of each party. But the kind of acceptance now enjoyed by Ms Meloni in wider international circles is still a remote dream for Ms Le Pen. The most likely outcome in France is a paralysed hung parliament or an unruly coalition government of non-Le Pen parties. Any and all of these scenarios reduce Emmanuel Macron to a pretty lame-duck president. Political instability at home means big EU powers, France and also Germany, are turning inwards at a time of great global uncertainty. Wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine. EU and Nato-sceptic Donald Trump is poised to possibly return to the White House. It’s a precarious moment for Europe to be without leadership. Voters feel exposed. Even if not this Sunday, Marine Le Pen’s followers firmly believe their time is coming. Soon.

150,Forget Ethiopia's Spice Girls - this singer salutes the true queens,"Gabriella Ghermandi recalls with laughter the annoyance she felt about the so-called Ethiopian Spice Girls - charity-backed pop group Yegna that hoped to change narratives and empower girls and women through music. The all-female group sparked controversy in the UK because it was partly funded by British aid and some say it was a waste of taxpayers' money. But for Ghermandi, assumptions that Ethiopian women had to be taught by outsiders was the issue. “I was like, what?” Ghermandi tells the BBC. “They want to teach us how to empower women? Ethiopia? With all its epics of women?” So, Ghermandi - an Ethiopian-Italian author, singer, producer and ethno-musicologist - also turned to music as a way of “saying to the world that we have a huge history about brave women who had as much power as men”. The result is a nine-track album called Maqeda – the Amharic name for the Queen of Sheba, a hugely important figure in Ethiopian history.  Every song is an homage to female figures, communities, rituals and musical styles. Many would label this album Ethio-jazz but it encompasses so much more, says Ghermandi.  “It’s a very rooted Ethiopian music, but at the same time, there are very prog sounds, very rocky and punk sounds. You can find everything"". Maqeda was lovingly developed over four years, bringing together the Ethiopian and Italian musicians she has worked with since 2010 as the Atse Tewodros Project – plus Senegalese guest musicians, as well as a beat-boxer and a body music performer. “We wanted to digest the music,” says Ghermandi of the collaboration, adding that every musician had a role in the arrangements ""because I really wanted my two countries to be one”. Born in Addis Ababa in 1965, to a father from Italy and an Ethiopian-Italian mother, Ghermandi recalls the international feel of the capital city where she spent her early years. “Every place, every corner was [filled] with music and dance. And I think I learned the rhythm that has stayed in my blood,” she says. On the same street as her mother’s clothes shop was a record store run by a Greek woman which blasted out an array of sound from Congolese music to the Beatles.  Fela Kuti and other African greats played at the nightclubs where Ghermandi would tag along with her older brothers, while on Sundays there were tea-dancing parties at an Italian expat club. Although Ghermandi had no formal music training, a thorough immersion in Ethiopian musical styles came from the many wedding and church ceremonies that were part of family life. Travel was another constant in Ghermandi’s childhood – thanks to her father. In 1935 he left Italy to work in Eritrea, then an Italian colony. In 1955 he moved to Ethiopia and met her mother, who was 17 years younger. His jobs in construction took him to remote areas, and Ghermandi would often visit. She was only three months old when she was taken to the Rift Valley of southern Ethiopia. Her father wanted her to be given a moytse - or “sound name” - by the local Oyda people. For girls, a cow horn is blown – and whatever sound is heard by a very old and very young woman waiting together underneath a tree in the forest becomes the sound name. Ghermandi’s moytse is tumlele, tumlele, tumlelela. Her father died in 1978. By then, the military dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam ruled Ethiopia and so, in the early 1980s, by then a teenager, she moved to Italy. Ghermandi now lives between Italy and Ethiopia. But those cherished early experiences have stayed with her, and this latest album draws on childhood visits to Ethiopia’s remote communities as well as meticulous research as adult. Ghermandi says she started with the community she grew up with – the Dorze people originally from the southern highlands of Ethiopia, whose women head villages and sing in powerful polyphonic choirs. You can hear that way of singing – with up to six voices or parts, each with an independent but harmonising melody – in the song Boncho, which means “respect” in the Gamo language. Ghermandi worked with an Ethiopian female poet to create Set Nat (She is a Female), to counter a common saying in Ethiopia that when a woman achieves something it is because she is as brave as a man. “I hate this saying, because it used to tell me that it’s not enough to be a woman,” Ghermandi says with passion in her voice. “And I want to say to the world that being a woman is more than enough!” The song is led by a choir whose call-and-response has a distinct, rhythmic feel in a 7/4 time signature. “This is very typical of a part of Ethiopia – and it is a memory of my childhood,” she explains. Another track, Kotilidda, honours the matrilineal society of the Kunama people who live close to the borders with Eritrea and Sudan. It showcases the avangala, a two-stringed instrument which sounds like a bass guitar  - played only by the Kunama people. “I really wanted to mix the Ethiopian traditional instruments with modern instruments because Ethiopia does not promote enough its traditional instruments outside the country,” says Ghermandi. “I also want to show to Ethiopian artists that these instruments can have a dialogue with modern instruments - and be very modern at the same time, even if they are traditional.” Saba, meanwhile, sings of the legendary Queen of Sheba’s camel journey to Jerusalem to meet King Solomon.  The masinqo - a one-stringed fiddle - plays an ancient Hebrew melody at the end, in recognition of the belief that Ethiopia's Jewish community is descended from those who followed the son of Sheba when she returned home from what is now Israel. Ghermandi points out the parallels between that ancient, likely mythical, journey and the very real journeys taken today by many thousands of Ethiopians who have fled conflict, oppression, drought and poverty for a new life elsewhere. “In the song there’s the idea of walking - and the idea of facing all the things that you find during your journey.” Penny Dale is a freelance journalist, podcast and documentary-maker based in London Maqeda by the Atse Tewodros Project is released through Galileo MC Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

149,"She accused Assange of sexual assault, but is glad he’s now free","Swedish human rights activist Anna Ardin is glad Julian Assange is free. But the claims she has made about him suggest she would have every reason not to wish him well. She is one of two women who accused the WikiLeaks founder of sexual assault 14 years ago. The allegations - which Assange has always denied - were explosive, and made headlines across the world. They set off a chain of events which saw him trying to avoid extradition to Sweden by seeking asylum in a London embassy for seven years. In 2019 the Swedish authorities ended their investigation. However, he spent the next five years in a British prison fighting extradition to the US, where he faced prosecution over massive leaks of confidential information.  These include US army footage showing Iraqi civilians being killed, and documents suggesting the US military killed hundreds of Afghan civilians in unreported incidents. Assange was eventually freed last month, after a plea deal with the US. Ardin is fiercely proud of Assange's work for WikiLeaks, and insists that it should never have landed him behind bars. “We have the right to know about the wars that are fought in our name,” she says. “I’m sincerely happy for him and his family, that they can be together. The punishment he’s got has been very unproportionate.” Speaking to Ardin over Zoom in Stockholm, it quickly becomes clear that she has no problem keeping what she sees as the two Assanges apart in her head - the visionary activist and the man who she says does not treat women well. She is at pains to describe him neither as a hero nor a monster, but a complicated man. The 45-year-old activist is also a Christian deacon, with a belief in forgiveness, and she uses the words ""truth"" and ""transparency"" again and again throughout the interview. It might explain why she is in awe of what WikiLeaks accomplished but, at the same time, bitterly disappointed that the assault allegations she made against Assange were never formally tested. Ardin describes her encounter with Assange in her book, No Heroes, No Monsters: What I Learned Being The Most Hated Woman On The Internet. In 2010, just three weeks after WikiLeaks’ release of the Afghan war logs, she invited him to Stockholm to take part in a seminar organised by the religious wing of Sweden’s Social Democrats. Assange did not want to stay at a hotel for security reasons and Ardin was due to be away, so she offered him her flat. But she returned early. After an evening of discussing politics and human rights, they ended up having what she describes as uncomfortable sex during which she says he humiliated her. Ardin says she was pressured into having sex with Assange and stressed he must use a condom, but the condom broke and he continued. She says he deliberately broke the condom. If this was the case, he probably would have committed an offence under Swedish law. Later, Ardin writes that she heard from another woman - named in legal papers as SW - who had attended the seminar. SW apparently said that Assange had penetrated her without her consent when she was asleep.  In a 2016 statement to Swedish prosecutors, Assange maintained that his sexual relationship with SW was entirely consensual, and that in texts seen by his lawyers, she told a friend that she had been “half asleep”. Both women filed police reports - Ardin's case was categorised as alleged sexual misconduct, and SW's as alleged rape. The press got hold of the reports, setting off an extraordinary series of events. Assange denied the allegations, and suggested that they were a US set-up. WikiLeaks had just leaked 76,000 US military documents - sparking massive global attention and scrutiny of US foreign policy. On 21 August, 2010, WikiLeaks tweeted: “We were warned to expect ‘dirty tricks’. Now we have the first one.” Another post followed the next day: “Reminder: US intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks as far back as 2008.” Assange’s UK lawyer Mark Stephens claimed that a “honeytrap” had been sprung and that “dark forces” were at work. A social media furore erupted which Ardin describes as “hell” – she tells me the amount of harassment and death threats forced her to leave Sweden at one point. “I couldn’t work. My life passed me by for two years.” To this day, many believe Ardin is part of a US conspiracy, and that her allegations are false. Greece’s former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, a long-time supporter of Assange, last week described her claims as “mud” and “innuendo”. No evidence has ever been found to link Ardin with US intelligence. She concedes that the narratives spread by Assange had an air of plausibility, because he had been “messing with the Pentagon”, but says the claims were nothing but “lies” and a “smear campaign”. Months after the incidents, an international arrest warrant was issued for Assange, who was in London at that point. In December 2010, he admitted to the BBC that it was “not probable” he was part of a classic honey-trap operation - but he still denied any wrongdoing. Assange was convinced that if he went to Sweden he would then be extradited to the US - where he feared the death penalty awaited. In 2012, he took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Sweden refused to guarantee he would not be extradited to the US, but said any move to do so would need to be approved by the UK too. Both countries also said they would not extradite him if they thought he might face the death penalty. In 2015, Swedish prosecutors dropped the investigation into Ardin’s allegations as time had run out.  In 2019, prosecutors abandoned their investigation into SW's claims, saying the  evidence had “weakened considerably due to the long period of time since the events in question”. By this time, Assange was being held in London’s high-security Belmarsh prison, facing extradition to the US on espionage charges. If convicted there, he could have faced 170 years behind bars. Assange finally won his freedom in 2024, after agreeing to plead guilty to a single charge under the US Espionage Act.  Ardin still wishes he had faced trial for the alleged assault against her. “But he won’t. So I have to let it go.” She says some of her doubters don’t take her seriously because they don’t think the details of her experience, or reaction, were dramatic enough. She suggests there’s an expectation of sexual assault to always be brutal, involve a lot of violence, and leave the victim heavily traumatised - and if that doesn’t happen you can’t be a real victim, or a real offender. But that doesn’t align with what Ardin describes as the reality of her experience. She stresses that doesn’t make it any less serious or unacceptable.  She slams many of Assange's supporters - and journalists - for seeking a “one-sided narrative” which turns him into a hero, and her into an evil CIA agent. “I think that we have a problem that we have to have these heroes that are flawless… I don’t think heroes exist outside fairytales.” Ardin says her intention was never to write off Assange as a one-dimensional villain, to be “kicked out of society”. Offenders are seen as “monsters, completely different from all other men"", she says. And this means the “system goes on”, she argues, as “normal” men don’t realise that they, too, can be prone to violence - so they don’t interrogate themselves. “I want him to be seen as a normal guy. That's what normal guys do sometimes. They cross other people's boundaries.” She thinks that progressive movements often have problems calling out leaders, fearing any criticism delegitimises the entire cause. “You can't be a leader and abuse the people who are active in your movement, because the movement will not survive.” People should not be able to get away with sexual crimes, or any crimes just because they’re influential, she adds. The BBC contacted Assange's lawyers for comment on the claims repeated by Ardin in our interview with her, but they said he was ""not in a position to respond"". I ask what justice would have looked like for her at the end of this saga. Ardin tells me she is only interested in getting to what she describes as the truth. She is less interested in punishment. “Justice for me would have been to have transparency. I was not happy that he was locked up because he was [locked up] for the wrong reason.” Ardin is a left-wing Christian who attaches great importance to reconciliation and transformation. But for that to be possible, she says that perpetrators need to own up and genuinely commit to change. After all this contemplation, I wonder what she would say to Assange, if face to face with him now. Ardin tells me she would urge him to work on himself. She would ask him to admit that he “did not have the right to do what he did to me, and he doesn’t have that right towards other women either"". “He has to admit that for himself… He has to reflect on what he did.” If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line",2024-07-07 23:10:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1jgv3knnwo,"Phelan Chatterjee,",2024-07-06 23:10:26,
154,Israeli air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16,"At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured.  The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel said it had struck several Hamas “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”. A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were ""very, very serious"" and should be investigated.   The attack comes as hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon, following months of false starts. Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas. It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to ""pretty significant adjustments"" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire.  A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war.   Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.  The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter. One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit. ""This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning,"" she said. Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted.  More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders.  Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken ""numerous steps"" to ""mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence"". Hamas militants were using the location as a ""hideout"" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said. ""Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,"" it added. Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.  Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. ""We don’t have all the information yet. Since the war began, we have had more than  half of our facilities hit,"" Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.   ""Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Many were women and children."" She added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated.  A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. The head of the Unrwa described the June incident as ""horrific"" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was ""shocking"" but could not be confirmed. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. The organisation has rejected this.  In April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

155,'I want to work with fast cars and travel the world',"Andy Stephenson has spent more than 30 years in motorsport and is now at Aston Martin One of the bosses of the Aston Martin Formula One team said he was in his ""dream job"" as he prepares for his team's home Grand Prix on Sunday. Andy Stephenson has spent more than 30 years in the sport, starting with the Jordan motor racing team in the late 80s. He is now the sporting director of Silverstone-based Aston Martin, which returned to Formula One in 2021. The 56-year-old said: ""When I was at school, I went to the careers office [and] said 'I want to work with fast cars and travel the world'."" He said he was told he ""won't find a job like that, but fortunately I did"". Aston Martin returned to Formula One in 2021 After returning to the sport, Aston Martin leapt from the midfield to be regular podium contenders at the start of 2023. In 2024, the team have had several top-six qualifying positions for lead driver Fernando Alonso and sit fifth in the constructors' championship after 11 of 24 races. Stephenson said that although there have been significant changes in technology since he started in Formula One, ""the aim is still exactly the same"". ""We want to go racing; we want to win races; we want to be competitive; and we eventually want to win World Championships,"" he said. He said once the Silverstone site in Northamptonshire is fully open the team will have ""close to 1,000 staff"". ""It's certainly changed from the day I first walked into the factory owned by Eddie Jordan, where there were eight of us,"" he said. Stephenson, who is from Northampton, began as an engineer and now represents the team in discussions with the sports governing body, the FIA. He said: ""It is a lot of fun and has a lot of challenges; it's not all champagne and trophies, but something that's really, really enjoyable and a job that I love."" Former World Champion Fernando Alonso is one of the teams drivers The sporting director said Silverstone was a circuit ""that's very special to my heart"". He said: ""My mum used to work here as a young girl at the weekend selling burgers and hot dogs and I have been working here ever since, so it is really special.

156,French left celebrates as far right faces surprise defeat,"France's far-right National Rally was widely expected to win this snap election, but projections say they have been beaten into third place. A left-wing alliance called New Popular Front are on course for victory, after a highly charged and abbreviated election called only four weeks ago by a weakened President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally (RN) won the first round of this election, and all the opinion polls since then predicted victory in the run-off round.  Instead, France is heading for a hung parliament with no party having anything like a majority. RN leader Jordan Bardella blamed ""unnatural political alliances"" for stopping their rise to power.  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who was appointed by President Macron only seven months ago, said he would hand in his resignation in the morning, although he pointed out that his Ensemble alliance were on course to win three times the number of seats that had been forecast. That was in part because 217 candidates, mainly from the left alliance and the Macron camp, had dropped out of the race to help their political rivals defeat RN.  Plenty of people were unhappy about it, but it meant that voters who had backed the centre or the left in the first round then pivoted to a rival party a week later, with the single aim of keeping the far right from taking control of parliament. Mr Bardella complained that millions of French voters had been deprived of a response to France's cost of living crisis by what he condemned as ""alliances of dishonour"". ""We don't want power for power's sake, but to hand it to the French people"" Mr Bardella told his supporters.  Party colleague Sébastien Chenu accused the Macron alliance of enabling a left-wing victory, leaving France in a ""quagmire"" conjured up by the president. That alliance has now left France heading for a hung parliament, but also in uncharted territory because the biggest group in the left-wing alliance is led by the radical and abrasive Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose France Unbowed is widely seen as far left by his rivals. A projection for TF1 TV gave France Unbowed (LFI) up to 94 seats, by far the most in his alliance. He was quick to seize the moment, telling his supporters: ""The president's defeat is clear; the president must accept his defeat, the prime minister must go."" A little more than an hour later Mr Attal - unlike President Macron, a highly popular politician - said he would do just that.  In an address from his residence at Hôtel Matignon, he said French voters had rejected the prospect of an extreme government. He praised all the candidates who had withdrawn from the race to stop RN from winning. ""Tomorrow morning I will hand in my resignation,"" he said. ""A new era starts tonight.""  Turning to the millions of voters who backed the far right he added: ""I respect every one of you, because there are no categories of French people who vote right and those of vote wrong."" His fate is now in the president's hands as France needs a stable government during the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July. Mr Attal said he was ready to remain in post ""for as long as duty demands"". But there are few people in the New Popular Front who are happy for him to stay in office. ""The president has the power and the duty to call us, the New Popular Front to govern. We are ready,"" Mr Mélenchon declared. Hastily cobbled together when Mr Macron stunned France with this two-round vote, the alliance includes Greens, Communists and Socialists as well as France Unbowed. Greens leader Marine Tondelier agreed the Popular Front was now ready to govern France: ""We've won and now we're going to govern France."" But she said now was not the time to push for a new prime minister. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ""France has said no to the far right coming to power. The far right made the choice of dividing the French people."" One of France's best-regarded politicians, former Macron prime minister Edouard Philippe, said the election campaign had led to great uncertainty in France.  While a ""crushing majority"" of the French people had said no to RN, they had also not given the left a majority to govern. It was now, he said, up to centrist political forces to seek a deal that would re-establish stability in France after weeks of tensions.

157,French people reject the far right  - again,"The French have said it again: they do not want the far right in power. They gave them a big win in the European elections; they gave them a big win in the first round of this parliamentary election. But when it came to a vote that really counted, just as in the presidentials, they drew back from the brink. This surprise upset which has reduced the National Rally (RN) to third place – with perhaps 150 seats compared with predictions a week ago of nearly 300 – is due entirely to voters turning out in large numbers to stop them. The RN will argue – with some justice – that this was only possible because the other parties came together to play the system. They note that the disparate parties of the left all suddenly forgot their differences to form a new anti-RN coalition;  and then that the Macronites and the left forgot their differences too. They note that nothing unites these politicians (from Edouard Philippe on the centre right to Philippe Poutou of the Trotskyist left) except their opposition to the RN.  And that this lack of agreement bodes ill for the future. Nonetheless, the fact remains. Most people do not want the far right – either because they oppose its ideas, or because they fear the unrest that would inevitably attend its coming to power. So if Jordan Bardella will not be the country’s next prime minister, who will be? That is the great unknown. And contrary to convention following previous French parliamentary elections, it may be weeks before we have an answer. Because something has happened these past tense weeks to change the very nature of the French political system.  As Alain Duhamel — veteran of every election since Charles de Gaulle – put it: “Today there is no longer any dominant party. Since Macron came to power seven years ago, we have been in a period of deconstruction of our political forces. “Perhaps now we are beginning a period of reconstruction.” What he means is that there is now a multitude of political forces: three major blocs (left, far-right and centre); plus the centre-right.  And within these there are competing tendencies and parties. With no party able to call the shots in the Assembly, a long period of haggling is now inevitable aimed at forming a new coalition from the centre-right through to the left. It is far from obvious how it will be formed – given the mutual loathing that the different potential components have expressed till now. But we can bet that President Macron will now call for a period of apaisement – conciliation – after the tensions of the last weeks. Conveniently this period will last through the Olympics and the summer holidays, allowing the French to recover their spirits. In the meantime, he will designate somebody to lead the talks and reach out to the different parties. Will it be someone from the left? Will it be someone from the centre?  Will it be a political outsider?  We do not know. What seems certain though is that France is about to enter a more parliamentary system.   Power will drain from President Macron, and towards whoever heads the new government. Even if he manages to place a centrist in the prime ministership (far from easy, given the strength of the left) that person will exercise power in his or her own right, and on the basis of parliamentary support.  Macron – with no prospect of running again in 2027 – will be a diminished figure. So has the president lost his bet?  Is he regretting his haste in calling the elections?  Is he ready to take a backward step? We can be sure that is not the way Macron sees it.  He will be saying that he called the vote because the situation was untenable; that he has clarified politics,  offered the RN a fairer share of Assembly seats, given their widespread support; and  that his gamble that the French would never put the far-right in power was correct. And in the meantime, he has not exactly gone away.  Macron’s power may be on the wane.  But he is still there at the Elysée, consulting with his team, prodding politicians,  still master of the political clock.",2024-07-07 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrlxn4ngdgo,"Hugh Schofield,",2024-07-07 21:10:28,
158,Slovak PM in first public appearance since shooting,"The Slovakian prime minister has made his first public appearance since being wounded in an assassination attempt. Robert Fico was shot several times on 15 May while greeting people outside a cultural centre in Handlova, about 180km (112 miles) from the capital Bratislava, after holding a meeting there. He was rushed to hospital to undergo emergency surgery, before later being discharged to receive care at home. On Friday, Mr Fico spoke during a ceremony at Devin Castle in Bratislava to mark Saints Cyril and Methodius Day, a public holiday in Slovakia. Cyril and Methodius were brothers credited with converting Slavic people in the region to Christianity in the 9th Century and creating an early version of the Cyrillic alphabet. Mr Fico, 59, used a speech at the commemoration to criticise the supposed expansion of progressive ideologies and the West's stance towards Russia over the war in Ukraine. He said ""meaningless"" liberal ideas were ""spreading like cancer"", and that there were ""not enough peace talks"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the Russian invasion, according to local and international media reports. Mr Fico, a populist who returned to office last October, is a divisive figure both domestically and within the wider EU, with calls to end military aid to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. He has also proposed abolishing Slovakia's public broadcaster. His attacker, previously named as 71-year-old Jurac C, has been described as a writer and political activist. Footage of the incident shows a gun being pulled in the crowd and five shots ringing out. The Slovakian PM was then bundled into a car by his bodyguards while the suspected shooter was detained at the scene. In a video address posted on social media on 5 June, Mr Fico said he forgave his assailant and felt no hatred towards him, while blaming the attack on his parliamentary opposition.",2024-07-07 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevwkjdxyvlo,"Aleks Phillips,",2024-07-06 23:10:28,

The 24-time Grand Slam champion is 16 years Rune's senior but doesn't underestimate the challenge the Dane will pose when they close proceedings on Centre Court. ""Rune's a spectacular player, no doubt. He loves the big stage, loves playing on grass. I think he's a very, very tricky opponent,"" said second seed Djokovic. The 37-year-old is going for an eighth Wimbledon title and record 25th Grand Slam overall. ""It's going to take my best tennis to win,"" he added. ""I actually get along very well with [Rune]. He's a very nice guy, always has been to me and to my team, and vice versa."" The pair have met five times previously, with Serb Djokovic winning on three occasions, including the two most recent, on hard courts in 2023. ""I always try to be available to him for any practice or advice or guidance or anything like that,"" said Djokovic. ""I think we have quite similar styles of tennis. But when it comes to playing on the court and competing, obviously we both have that fire. I'm sure that on Monday, we'll see a lot of fireworks on the court."" Following knee surgery just weeks before arriving at SW19, Djokovic is yet to win a match in straight sets at the All England Club but Rune said he still expects a ""tough battle"". ""I'm expecting nothing but a great level from him. I know he did his surgery, but honestly I practised with him in the first week, and I saw him playing a little bit,"" said the 15th seed.  ""He seems like he's playing very well, feeling confident.""

163,Olise joins Bayern from Palace on five-year deal,"Michael Olise played half of Crystal Palace's Premier League matches last season as he was hampered with a hamstring injury Bayern Munich have signed winger Michael Olise from Crystal Palace for about 60m euros (£50m). The 22-year-old English-born France Under-21 forward made 90 appearances in all competitions over three seasons with Palace. Olise, who joined the Eagles from Reading for £8m in July 2021, has signed a five-year deal. Chelsea and Newcastle United registered their interest in Olise earlier this summer but the winger has chosen to move to Germany, where he will work under Bayern's new manager Vincent Kompany. ""I'm very happy to now be playing for such a big club - it's a great challenge and that's exactly what I was looking for,"" said Olise.

Olise scored 10 goals in 19 Premier League appearances as Palace finished 10th in the table last season. He has been selected in the France squad for the Olympics that start in Paris later this month. ""We are hugely proud of what Michael has achieved at Crystal Palace, a club where he has developed greatly as a player,"" said Eagles chairman Steve Parish.

165,I thought it was never going to happen again - Hamilton,"Hamilton has won a record nine times at Silverstone, and has a straight named after him Lewis Hamilton has had to wait for it, but he finally had his moment of redemption at the British Grand Prix and returned to the top step of a Formula 1 podium - two years, seven months and two days since he last stood there. In doing so, he broke the record for wins at a single track, and did it in front of his home crowd and his family. “I can’t stop crying,” he said straight after climbing out of his car. Later, he said: “That might be the most emotional ending to a race I think I have probably ever had.” To understand those tears, you have to consider what Hamilton has been through in that period. His last victory was at the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, as his fierce title fight with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen came to a dramatic climax. A week later, in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton lost the chance to win a record eighth championship after the then race director, Michael Masi, made up the rules as he went along in a late safety-car period. Over the winter that followed, Hamilton thought about walking away from the sport. Instead, he came back determined to right what he perceived as a wrong, a title that he felt was robbed from him. Only to find that his Mercedes team - after eight consecutive world constructors’ titles - had lost their way following the introduction of new rules. In the 945 days between his last win and this one, Hamilton said on Sunday, he had doubted himself; doubted, too, whether another victory would ever come. “The adversity we have gone thought as a team and I have personally experienced,” he said, ""the constant challenge, like we all have, to get out of bed every day and give it your best shot. “So many times when you feel like your best shot is not good enough, and the disappointment sometimes you can feel. “We live in a time when mental health is such a serious issue and I am not going to lie (and deny) that I have experienced that. “There have definitely been moments between 2021 and here when I didn’t feel like I was good enough, or I thought it was never going to happen again. I have never cried coming from a win. It just came out of me. It is a really great feeling and I am really grateful for it.” Over the past two years, with a few exceptions, he has generally avoided talking about Abu Dhabi and its impact on him. But this time he let it out. “Honestly, when I came back in 2022, I thought that I was over it,” Hamilton said. “And I know I wasn’t, and it's taken a long time to heal that kind of feeling. That's only natural for anyone that has that experience. I've just been continuing to try and work on myself and find that inner peace day by day.” The emotions at Silverstone were so intense because so many aspects of his life journey had come together at once. Not just the end of a long, long win drought. But his home grand prix, in front of a crowd that adores him and cheered his every move, even when he was fighting with another Briton, Lando Norris. On a track that he said he considered the “best in the world”. On top of that, he is in his last season with Mercedes, who have backed him since he was 13, before he moves to Ferrari next season; his desire to end his career with them on a high. And an appreciation of time passing, and of valuable personal moments spent with the people he loves most in the world - his father, mother, brother, sister and her children were all at Silverstone with him. “Your parents are getting older, you know. We're travelling so much,” Hamilton said. “Time with family is a constant challenge. My niece and nephew are growing up and growing out of their cuteness. But I've had them here this weekend. “We all try to be there for each other, even at a distance. I know I've always had their support, but to be able to see them there and share this experience, they wanted to be at my last race, the last British Grand Prix with this team that have been so incredible to us. “Mercedes obviously supported me since I was 13. So it's definitely meant the most today to have them there and to be able to share it with them.” Hamilton wins British GP for ninth time Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Hamilton triumphed in a race that ebbed and flowed, from a dry start, through two periods of wet weather into a dry finish, and in which the winner was in doubt until the very end. Hamilton had qualified second to team-mate George Russell and they ran that way through the early laps. The McLarens of Norris and Oscar Piastri came to the fore in the wet middle period, only to fumble their pit strategy, and hand the win to Hamilton at the final pit stops, when Verstappen also came back into the frame after an unusually uncompetitive race for him was turned by Red Bull’s final tyre choice. Verstappen charged by Norris to take second, and then chased down Hamilton, who held on to win by just over a second. In the dry early phase, the Mercedes were clearly the fastest cars on track, and Hamilton managed his soft tyres in the closing laps expertly, while Norris’ fell off badly. It was confirmation that Mercedes really are finally back in the battle at the front after a long, trying period. It has happened so quickly. As Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff put it: “Five races ago, we weren’t contenders for the podium and it looked like we were in the third year of non-performance, and then it clicked.” The “click” moment, Wolff said, was largely down to the input of James Allison, who was reinstalled as Mercedes technical director in the spring of last year when Mercedes realised they had messed up their car for the second year in succession. “There was a moment where, led by James, suddenly the data made sense,” Wolff said. ""The way we made it, the way we balanced the car. And how we could bring it in a better sweet spot. That was the main thing. It wasn’t a miracle front wing, it was more the balance we achieved.” For his part, Allison explains the transition as one of culture inside the team. He says it took Mercedes too long to realise that the rules introduced in 2022 “require a different set of skills and a different way of interacting with each other”. The various departments that define the design and performance of the car, Allison says, need to work much more closely together than under the previous set of rules, under which Mercedes were so successful. “The car,” he says, “is just the outcome of the institutional approach to designing a car. Everything about being competitive is about valuing the right things, putting resource onto the right things and then pursuing those right things with vigour. The car just pops out at the end as a consequence of that.” Having realised what was important in making the car fast, and made the appropriate organisational changes, Mercedes have made remarkable progress. “Suddenly,” Wolff said, “everything that didn’t make sense, made sense and the results of the development direction is back in the old days.” They have been on pole at two of the last four races. Russell, who retired at Silverstone with a water leak, won in Austria a week ago, inheriting the lead when Verstappen and Norris collided and damaged their cars. At Silverstone, the Mercedes qualified one-two and were the fastest cars in the race, except when the track was wet, and even then the swing in performance was down to McLaren running more downforce. Hamilton said: “There's still a long, long way to go, but we are super close, and I think hopefully with the next upgrade perhaps, we will be in an even stronger position to really, really be fighting for the front row more consistently.” The next upgrade will come at the next race in Hungary, another of Hamilton’s favourite tracks, with another to follow in Belgium a week later. “We are finding performance and we are putting it on the car,” Wolff said. “And it translates into lap time and that wasn’t the case for the last two years. “There is more to come in terms of performance. We are bringing updates to Budapest and Spa but on the other side we mustn’t get carried away. We had a win last week benefiting from (Verstappen and Norris) tangling but today we have an honest win. “We had the real pace. You could see George and Lewis in the lead and almost under all conditions we were there.” Hamilton, pictured here with father Anthony, was emotional following his win Hamilton, Norris and the other leading drivers at Silverstone put on arguably the best race so far of a year that has completely shifted from the Red Bull domination of the first five races. In the end, Verstappen split Hamilton and Norris, but it could easily have been a British one-two, and either way around. Norris was leading going into the final pit stops, but the decision to stop for the final time a lap later than Hamilton and Verstappen, in addition to a delay caused by having to hold the car for the passing Ferrari of Carlos Sainz, put Hamilton in front. When the McLaren chewed through its soft tyres faster than the Mercedes, Verstappen was able to close in and take second. For McLaren and Norris, it was another “missed opportunity”, as team principal Andrea Stella put it, to add to others in Canada, Spain and Austria. Norris was very down on himself afterwards. “We threw it away at the final stop,” Norris said. “Even if we had boxed on the perfect lap, the decision to go on the softs was the wrong one. Lewis would still have won, so two calls from our side cost us. Stella said the team took responsibility for the pit calls. But Norris, at least after the race, was looking at himself. “I didn’t do a good enough job today with the calls,” he said, “So many things are good and in place, just not executing things the way I want and need to. “When you throw away a win, it is pretty disappointing. I am just not to the level I need to be at, not to the level of the others at the minute. It is something I need to work on.” This video can not be played Formula 1: McLaren’s Lando Norris explains what he loves about the British Grand Prix",2024-07-07 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cl5ywv730ezo,Andrew Benson,2024-07-07 21:10:29,
162,Wimbledon run has 'fuelled the fire' - Raducanu,"This video can not be played Sun knocks out Raducanu with impressive win Britain's Emma Raducanu says an encouraging Wimbledon run has ""fuelled the fire"" to continue her upward trajectory over the rest of the season. Raducanu, 21, was beaten 6-2 5-7 6-2 by New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun in the fourth round on Sunday. It was a disappointing exit after a series of dominant performances had heightened excitement at the All England Club. But, having reached the fourth round of a major for the first time since winning the 2021 US Open, Raducanu reflected positively on the past week. ""I feel good about things going forwards. I feel optimistic,"" said Raducanu, who is set to move back inside the world's top 100 next week. ""As bitter as it is to take, I think [this defeat] happened for a reason.  ""You don't want things to happen too easily and too quickly. I had that before. I don't necessarily want just a massive spike."" Raducanu, who was given a wildcard for the All England Club, was outplayed for much of a fascinating contest. Having won six matches in a row on the SW19 grass, Sun oozed confidence and hit a flurry of winners. Raducanu wrestled back momentum by winning the second set but lost serve early in the decider shortly after needing treatment following a fall. The opening game of the third set was stopped and she received treatment - on her leg and back - while laid out on the court. Having missed last year's Wimbledon after having operations on both wrists and her ankle, she added: ""Six months ago when I was starting out after surgery, I would have signed for the fourth round at Wimbledon.  ""Of course I'm disappointed. Of course I want more. ""It fuels the fire and makes me more hungry."" Raducanu's defeat came a day after she pulled out of a planned mixed doubles appearance alongside fellow Briton Andy Murray, citing ""stiffness"" in her right wrist. Even though it was a sensible precaution - she had needed surgery on the same wrist last year - the move led to some criticism, given it denied Murray the chance to play again in his Wimbledon farewell. Raducanu said it was a ""tough"" decision, adding she still stood by ""making the right call"". ""With every decision, people are entitled to their opinions. Of course, there was a bit of a cloud around the decision,"" she said. ""I don't think I would have done it any other way.  ""I think in this sport, especially as an individual, you have to make your own calls and prioritise yourself.  ""Especially with my history, I just had to put myself first."" Raducanu knocked out of Wimbledon by qualifier Sun Ashleigh Barty, Australian former world number one and 2019 Wimbledon champion, on BBC TV I think this is a beautiful foundation for Emma to build from.  Her career has been back to front in a way. She flipped the script and went right to the top, won a Grand Slam.  This is her chance to use her experience but it's also a restart.  You have to be accountable for your own actions and understand there are consequences and she's comfortable with that.  I think she has a better life balance now and she's enjoying her tennis. She's fit and healthy and building some continuity.

160,Alcaraz into last eight as 'high level' overcomes Humbert,"This video can not be played Alcaraz sees off Humbert to reach last eight Carlos Alcaraz inched a step closer to defending his Wimbledon title with a hard-fought victory over Ugo Humbert. The 21-year-old Spaniard held off a late charge from 16th seed Humbert to win 6-3 6-4 1-6 7-5 and move into the last eight at SW19. It took Alcaraz's winning streak at Grand Slams to 11 following his French Open triumph last month. ""I feel great playing today, I think I played a really high level,"" he said. ""Playing a leftie, I try not to think about it and play my own game."" Alcaraz will next face American 12th seed Tommy Paul, the Queen's Club champion, who defeated Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. Meanwhile, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated American 14th seed Ben Shelton 6-2 6-4 7-6 (11-9). Shelton, who won in five sets in his first three rounds, had four set points in the third-set tie-break. Sinner, 22, will play Daniil Medvedev next after the Russian fifth seed benefitted from Grigor Dimitrov's early retirement with a leg injury. The Bulgarian 10th seed took a medical timeout before deciding, at 5-3 down in the first set, not to continue. Keys injury retirement sends Paolini into last eight It seemed unlikely Sunday's opening match on Centre Court would live up to the five-set classic Alcaraz played against Frances Tiafoe on Friday. And it became even more improbable when, with little effort, he found himself two sets up in what appeared a relatively dull encounter. But the three-time major winner suddenly faltered in the third set and Humbert stepped up to take advantage. The Frenchman, 26, raised his intensity, hitting the chalk with brilliant winners and breaking serve three times to force a fourth set. Both players struggled to hold in a tense set, and an increasingly frustrated Alcaraz turned to the crowd and his team for help, waving his arms animatedly to stir up support. With their backing, the defending champion found another gear, impressively holding his serve under immense pressure and breaking for a 6-5 lead. Alcaraz then served out the match and, relieved, he applauded all four corners of Centre Court in appreciation. This video can not be played Sinner beats Shelton in straight sets Under the roof on Court One, Shelton, perhaps feeling the effects of playing on a sixth day out of seven in the tournament so far, fell two sets down in just over an hour. However, Shelton fought back in the third and used a boisterous Court One crowd to break for a 2-0 lead. Australian Open champion Sinner pulled level and pulled off a stunning between-the-legs shot from a deep Shelton return that drew gasps from the crowd. After saving the set points, Sinner's victory was secured when Shelton double-faulted at 10-9 down. ""It was a tough match, especially the third set. I had to keep saving set point. These matches can go long but I was glad to close it in three,"" said Sinner.

Jaminet, who plays for Toulon, came off the bench in his national team's win away to Argentina on Saturday. He put the video up on his Instagram account and, despite deleting the post, it has still been shared on social media. Jaminet has been sent home from the tour and the French Rugby Federation said it ""condemns comments"" made by the 25-year-old ""in a video broadcast on social media"". It added: ""Such comments are totally unacceptable and are contrary to the fundamental values of our sport. ""As a consequence, Melvyn Jaminet has been removed from and has left the France squad currently in Argentina. ""An internal investigation is ongoing to shine a light on these comments, which are of an extreme seriousness and will take the appropriate measures.""

161,Gauff's Wimbledon woes continue in Navarro defeat,"This video can not be played Navarro shocks Gauff to reach first Grand Slam quarter-final Coco Gauff became the latest high-profile seed to suffer a shock exit in the women's singles at Wimbledon as she lost to fellow American Emma Navarro. Second seed Gauff was the highest-ranked player remaining, following Iga Swiatek's surprise defeat by Yulia Putintseva on Saturday. But the 20-year-old followed the world number one out of the door at SW19 after falling to a 6-4 6-3 defeat by 19th seed Navarro. It meant there were just two top-10 players remaining in the women's draw - fourth seed Elena Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini, who is seeded seventh. Wimbledon has been Gauff's toughest Grand Slam to crack having never gone past the fourth round. She has made it to the semi-finals of the Australian Open and Roland Garros, while she won her first major at last year's US Open. Navarro will play Italian Paolini, who is also into the Wimbledon last eight for the first time after a tearful Madison Keys retired with an injury in the deciding set of their match. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam tournament in which Coco Gauff has not reached the quarter-finals Gauff had breezed through the first three rounds at this year's Championships, underlining her title credentials with commanding wins.  But in her first test against a player in the world's top 20, unforced errors came to the fore while she struggled to deal with the variety of Navarro's game.  The pair looked evenly matched in the first set, trading breaks before Navarro struck a decisive blow with a forehand winner at 5-4. Despite being cheered on with chants of ""let's go Coco, let's go"", Gauff couldn't find a way back after her opponent broke for a 3-1 lead in the second.  ""I don’t have a ton of words but just really grateful to be out here on Centre Court,""  said Navarro, who sealed the biggest win of her career on her third match point. ""A tournament with so much history and tradition that so many legends have played on before - it's a real honour."" The win continued a breakthrough season for the Navarro, who is into the last eight of a Grand Slam for the first time. The 23-year-old won her first WTA title at the Hobart International in January, while she also reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time at last month's French Open. This video can not be played Keys pulls out with injury American Keys, 29, was forced to stop with the score locked at 6-3 6-7 (6-8) 5-5 on Court One. She appeared to pick up the injury when she hit a forehand while serving for victory at 5-2 in the final set. Keys, 29, took a medical timeout at the change of ends when leading 5-4 and was treated before leaving the court. The 12th seed reappeared with strapping high on her thigh and was clearly hampered by the injury. Paolini, 28, broke again to level at 5-5 before Keys decided she could no longer continue. ""Right now I'm so sorry for her,"" said Paolini. ""To end the match like this is bad. What can I say?  ""I think we played a really good match. It was tough, a lot of ups and downs. I'm feeling a bit happy but also sad for her. It's not easy to win like that."" French Open finalist Paolini had never won a match in the Wimbledon main draw before this year's tournament. After winning the first set, she trailed in the second 5-1 but rallied brilliantly to force a tie-break - which Keys eventually took on her fourth set point. Keys established a big lead again in the decider before her injury dashed her dreams. Elsewhere, Croatian Donna Vekic progressed to the last eight by overcoming Spaniard Paula Badosa in three sets. The world number 37 won 6-2 1-6 6-4 in a rain-interrupted game on court two. Vekic will play New Zealand's Lulu Sun in the quarter-finals after her win over Briton Emma Raducanu.

166,Macron asks French PM to stay on as political deadlock continues," French President Emmanuel Macron has asked his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to remain in post ""for the time being to ensure the country's stability"", after election results left no party with an outright majority. Mr Attal, who led the president's Ensemble alliance's election campaign, handed his resignation to Mr Macron on Monday, only for the president to refuse. Although Ensemble lost many of its seats in Sunday's parliament election, it came second, behind a left-wing alliance but ahead of the far right which had been expected to win. The unexpected result leaves French politics in deadlock, with no party able to form a government by itself. The New Popular Front, a left-wing alliance cobbled together after Mr Macron called the elections, argues that as the leading group in the next National Assembly it has earned the right to choose a prime minister. They were due to meet on Monday to consider who to propose for the job, but there is no obvious candidate who would satisfy the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party as well as the more moderate Socialists, Greens and Communists. Mr Attal had announced he would resign on Sunday night, but left open the possibility of remaining in the job as long as duty required him to do so.  It had been widely expected that his resignation would be rejected when he visited the Élysée Palace on Monday morning. President Macron is due to fly to the US on Tuesday for a Nato summit and Paris is hosting the Olympic Games from 26 July.  While it is not yet clear how long he needs Mr Attal to stay in office, the president made it clear that France now needed a period of calm. Outgoing Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned on Monday that the country was facing an immediate risk of financial crisis and economic decline. Since the results came out, Mr Macron has sought to steer clear of the political fray. A statement on Sunday night said that while he would respect the ""choice of the French people"", he was waiting for the full picture to emerge in parliament before taking the next, necessary decisions. The National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella had been widely expected to win the election, after taking a strong lead in Sunday's first round.  But even though their vote held up, with more than 10 million people backing RN and a group of conservative allies, they failed to come anywhere near the number of seats suggested by opinion polls, They ended up with 143 seats, when they had set themselves the ambition of reaching an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. The party's two leaders had bitterly accused the left and centrist blocs of stitching up the vote, with more than 200 candidates dropping out to give a rival candidate a chance of defeating RN. But by Monday, Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were trying to look ahead. ""In just two years, progress has been incredible and makes victory for us inevitable in the short term,"" said Ms Le Pen, thanking the 10 million voters who backed RN and its allies. ""The number one party for numbers of votes and MPs."" Mr Bardella was determined to focus on his future role in the European Parliament. He is now going to lead a new grouping the European Parliament called Patriots for Europe, formed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Hungary has taken over the presidency of the EU this month, and already Mr Orban has angered several of his European counterparts by becoming the first EU leader to visit Russia's Vladimir Putin in more than two years. President Macron had called France's snap parliamentary vote in response to RN's victory in EU elections only a month ago.

167,Children's hospital hit as Russian strikes kill dozens in Ukraine,"A children's hospital in Kyiv has been hit after Russia launched a wave of missile strikes against cities across Ukraine. Two people died when the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - sustained major damage during the blast.  Thirty-six people were killed and 140 people were injured in the strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Monday. Lesia Lysytsia, a doctor at the hospital, told the BBC the moment the missile struck was ""like in a film"" with a ""big light, then an awful sound"". ""One part of the hospital was destroyed and there was a fire in another. It's really very damaged - maybe 60-70% of the hospital,"" she said. Pictures from the scene showed young children - some with IV drips - sitting outside the hospital as it was evacuated. Vitaliy Klitschko, Kyiv's mayor, said the two who died at the hospital were adults - one of whom was a doctor. He added that rescuers feared more people were trapped under the rubble. Russia has denied targeting the hospital, saying it was hit by fragments of a Ukrainian air defence missile. But Ukraine says it has found remnants of a Russian cruise missile. Ohmatdyt is a major hospital which carries out cancer treatment and organ transplants. ""Now we are in the process of evacuating patients to the nearest hospital.. [but] many patients are intubated and on ventilators and cannot have contact with other patients or go outside,"" Dr Lysytsia said. Hospital officials told Ukrainian TV that about 20 children were being treated in the ward which was hit. Following the strike, Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina wore a black ribbon as a mark of respect when she played in the round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday afternoon. Mayor Klitschko accused Russia of attempting the ""genocide of [the] population in Ukraine"". ""Right now the whole world can see how Russian missiles and Kamikaze drones killed Ukrainian citizens in our peaceful city.  The mayor added that a separate maternity hospital in Kyiv's Dniprovsky district had also been partially destroyed by falling debris, killing seven people. Mr Zelensky wrote on social media that ""more than 40 missiles of different types"" had hit buildings and infrastructure in cities including Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. He called for a stronger Western response ""to the blow that Russia has once again delivered on our population, on our land, on our children"". Dnipro regional head Sergiy Lysak said one person was killed in Dnipro city and six more injured. He added that a high-rise building and a business had been hit. Three people were killed in Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken control of a number of villages in recent weeks. The Russian bombardment comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Moscow for a two-day state visit where he is due to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin. Russia, which has denied targeting civilian infrastructure, said the damage to the children's hospital was caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile. However, the Security Service of Ukraine has published pictures of what it says are fragments of a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile recovered from the site. Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov responded to the attacks by urging the country's allies to help quickly strengthen its air defences. ""Our defence capabilities are still insufficient... We need more air defence systems,"" he said. Ukraine's allies have condemned the attack on the Ohmatdyt hospital, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accusing Russia of ""ruthlessly targeting Ukrainian civilians"". New UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said ""we must hold those responsible for Putin's illegal war to account"". UN chief António Guterres strongly condemned the strikes, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, adding he found the attack on the children's hospital and another medical facility ""particularly shocking"". ""Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects is prohibited by international humanitarian law, and any such attacks are unacceptable and must end immediately,"" he said. The UN's human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has said civilian casualties have been mounting in recent months, as Russia renewed its air campaign. A recent report said May was the deadliest month for civilian deaths in almost a year.

182,Tate brothers accused of being serial tax evaders,"Controversial social media personality Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have been accused of failing to pay any tax on £21m of revenue from their online businesses. Devon and Cornwall Police is bringing a civil claim against the brothers and a third person, referred to only as J. They are accused of paying no tax in any country on their online business revenue between 2014 and 2022. The force is seeking to recover around £2.8 million in seven frozen bank accounts, an application the three defendants are contesting. ""Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate are serial tax and VAT evaders,"" Sarah Clarke KC for Devon and Cornwall Police told Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. ""They, in particular Andrew Tate, are brazen about it."" Ms Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: ""When I lived in England I refused to pay tax."" The court heard he said his approach was ""ignore, ignore, ignore because in the end they go away"". The court also heard that the brothers had ""a huge number of bank accounts"" in the UK, seven of which have been frozen. Ms Clarke said the money - from various products sold on websites including OnlyFans - had been “washed around” a huge number of UK bank accounts. As well as owning extensive land, property and vehicles in Romania, the Tates had spent their earnings on “fast cars and property”, Ms Clarke said. ""That's what tax evasion looks like, that's what money laundering looks like,"" she  told the court. The brothers are accused of paying just under $12m into an account in J's name, and opening a second account in her name, even though she had no role in their businesses, the court heard. Devon and Cornwall Police alleges that this was fraud by false misrepresentation. Ms Clarke said all three would not provide any evidence in the case. Money from the brothers' businesses including Cobra Tate, Hustlers' University and War Room was paid into the first account, held with payment service provider Stripe. It was opened in February 2019 in J's name with an incorrect date of birth, the court heard. Driving licences belonging to both Andrew Tate and J were later submitted to Stripe as proof of identity and address. The majority of payments out of this account went to one of Andrew Tate's accounts, the court heard. J also moved money through her own Revolut bank account, including one payment of £805,000, the court heard. Of this, £495,000 was paid to Andrew Tate, and £75,000 to an account in J's name that was later converted to cryptocurrency, it is alleged. The proceedings are civil, which uses a lower standard of proof than criminal cases. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring will decide on the balance of probabilities whether what the police claim is true. The case was adjourned until Tuesday. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views. In a separate case in Romania, the Tate brothers, former kickboxers who are dual UK-US nationals, are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group.

181,One dead after lake electrocution in Virginia,"One man died and two others were injured after they were electrocuted at a lake in Virginia last week.  The incident happened Thursday at Smith Mountain Lake in Huddelston, Virginia.  Officials say the man who died, 18-year-old Jesse Hamric, was electrocuted by stray voltage at a dock as he tried to swim.  Mr Hamric reportedly jumped into the water, which shocked him. Two people who saw him were also shocked when they tried to help.  The Smith Mountain Lake Marine Fire and Rescue Department responded to an area marina for reports of a drowning at a dock.  They transported Mr Hamric to an area hospital where he died from his injuries.  Officials later confirmed electricity was found in the water. Emergency responders said they do not believe foul play was involved. The dock where the incident took place is located at a private residence, according to local media.  Mr Hamric, of Colorado, was said to be visiting friends with his family when the incident happened.  His exact cause of death has not yet been determined and the incident remains under investigation.

180,Nobel laureate Alice Munro's daughter reveals family secret of abuse,"The youngest daughter of acclaimed Canadian Nobel laureate Alice Munro has said that her step-father sexually assaulted her as a child, and that her mother stayed with him even after learning of the abuse.  In an essay published in the Toronto Star on Sunday, Andrea Robin Skinner described how her step-father began assaulting her in the summer of 1976 when she was nine years old and he was in his 50s.  One evening, when Munro was away, he ""climbed into the bed where I was sleeping and sexually assaulted me"", Ms Skinner said.  Munro, who learned of the abuse years later, remained with him until his death in 2013.  The author, who died in May at the age of 92, is one of the most celebrated short-story writers in Canadian history. Her collections often focused on life in small-town Ontario where she was raised, earning praise for their nuanced portrayals of women and girls.  In the weekend essay, Ms Skinner and her siblings said they believed this dark family story must also be part of Munro's legacy. ""I never wanted to see another interview, biography or event that didn’t wrestle with the reality of what had happened to me, and with the fact that my mother, confronted with the truth of what had happened, chose to stay with, and protect, my abuser,"" she said.   In her weekend piece, Ms Skinner said she was first assaulted during a summer visit to her mother and step-father, Gerald Fremlin, in their home in Clinton, Ontario.  She later told her step-mother, who then told her father, Jim Munro, who decided not to confront Alice Munro at the time.  Ms Skinner returned to her mother's home the next year.  The step-mother, Carole, is quoted by The Star in a separate news story as saying: ""I told her she didn't have to go. But she wanted to spend time with her mother."" The BBC has reached out for comment Ms Skinner was initially relieved her father kept the family secret, she said, because of fears over how her mother would react.  ""She had told me that Fremlin liked me better than her, and I thought she would blame me if she ever found out,"" she wrote.  Over the next several years, during visits, the abuse continued.  Fremlin exposed himself to her during car rides, propositioned her for sex, and “told me about the little girls in the neighbourhood he liked"".  He lost interest when she became a teenager, Ms Skinner told The Star.  She said kept quiet about the abuse but in early adulthood found herself struggling at university and with her physical and mental health.  A few years later, in 1992, she revealed the abuse in a letter to her mother. She says Munro reacted as she had feared - ""as if she had learned of an infidelity"".  Fremlin, meanwhile, wrote his own letters at the time to the family - excerpts of which were published by The Star - in which he admitted the abuse but blamed Ms Skinner.  ""Andrea invaded my bedroom for sexual adventure,"" Fremlin wrote.  “If the worst comes to worst I intend to go public. I will make available for publication a number of photographs, notably some taken at my cabin near Ottawa which are extremely eloquent … one of Andrea in my underwear shorts,"" he said.  Amid the fallout, Alice Munro left Fremlin, staying at a flat she owned in British Columbia. But she returned to her husband after a few months and stayed with him for the rest of his life.  She said ""that our misogynistic culture was to blame if I expected her to deny her own needs, sacrifice for her children, and make up for the failings of men"", Ms Skinner wrote.  In 2005, Ms Skinner reported the abuse to Ontario police, presenting the letters written by Fremlin.  Police charged him with indecent assault. He pleaded guilty, but ""the silence continued"", Ms Skinner wrote, because of Munro's fame.  In a statement, Munro Books, founded by Alice and Jim Munro and now independently owned, said that it ""unequivocally supports"" Ms Skinner's decision to tell her story publicly.  In a separate statement released by the Canadian bookstore, the Munro siblings said that the store's decision to  acknowledge ""Andrea’s truth, and being very clear about their wish to end the legacy of silence, the current store owners have become part of our family’s healing"".

179,Rewards for tourists who litter pick in Copenhagen,"Tourists will be rewarded with free food and activities if they participate in environmentally friendly tasks while visiting Copenhagen, the city's tourist board has announced. The trial scheme, which begins on 15 July, will see tourist attractions in the Danish capital offer rewards for activities such as litter-picking, travelling by public transport or biking around the city. Under the initiative, visitors can claim free lunches, coffees, glasses of wine and kayak rental in return for their work. The ""CopenPay"" scheme is designed to offset the ""environmental burden"" of tourism, according to the Copenhagen tourist board. ""When you travel abroad - if you fly to other places or you travel by car - you pollute,"" says the tourist board's communications chief Rikke Holm Petersen. ""One of the things we can change is getting people to act more sustainably at the destination."" The plan is only a ""little step towards the green transition"", Ms Petersen admits. The project is ""trust-based"", meaning attractions are unlikely to ask for proof that the green activity has been completed. ""In some attractions you might have to show a picture of you riding a bike, or of your public transportation ticket,"" she says.  The government is not reimbursing the companies behind the attractions - including museums, rooftop bars and kayaking charities - for participating in the scheme. So far 24 organisations have signed up to the pilot. Last year, Denmark recorded over 12 million overnight stays across the country, according to government statistics. Ms Petersen anticipates a ""small percentage"" of visitors to the city will participate in the trial, which runs until 11 August.  Othy Jasper, a 25-year-old Londoner who will be travelling to Copenhagen for work in August, said he is ""conscious"" of his air miles when he travels. ""It can really rack up - you have to think is it essential, is it worthwhile? Of everything one can do, catching flights is possibly the worst for pollution."" Speaking on the scheme, he says ""it's cool they're doing something for the climate"" but it would be unlikely he would spend time collecting litter in return for a reward. ""In terms of an incentive, it feels like a bit of an effort to do.""  If the scheme is judged to be a success it will be rolled out across the rest of the year. ""Imagine if we could have people taking a greener mindset back with them - if that was the souvenir they got - that would be amazing,"" Ms Petersen says.

178,Two dead as Beryl slams Texas leaving millions without power,"At least two people have died as Hurricane Beryl slammed into southeast Texas, knocking out power for more than two million people while bringing heavy rain and fierce wind gusts. When Beryl first hit Texas on Monday morning, it landed as a category one hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm. Officials have warned of destructive winds, up to 15in (38cm) of rain and ""life-threatening"" storm surges. More than 1,300 flights at Houston's largest airport have been cancelled. The state governor’s office has repeatedly urged residents not to underestimate the storm, which caused at least 10 deaths in the Caribbean days before. In Texas, a 53-year-old man died after ripping winds downed powerlines and knocked a tree onto his home in Harris County, causing his roof to collapse.  In the same county, which includes parts of Houston, a 74-year-old woman was also reported dead after a tree crashed through the roof of her home. The police were notified by the woman's granddaughter.  On Monday, police in one Houston suburb had already begun conducting water rescues as the hurricane continued to pound the state. According to US forecaster AccuWeather, landfalling hurricanes of this kind are somewhat rare for Texas in July. Houston is a low-lying coastal city, making it prone to flooding.  Sustained wind speeds in the Houston area had reached 75mph (120km/h) with wind gusts reaching 87mph (140km/h). Torrential rainfall and flash flooding have also occurred in areas where inches of rain fell in just a few hours.  The storm is expected to lose strength as it gradually tracks north-northeast but flash flooding and heavy rain remains a risk. More than 2.7 million customers in Texas are without power as of Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. At Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston's largest airport, 1,097 flights were cancelled, according to flightaware.com.  As the storm barrelled its way past Houston, tornado warnings were issued for dozens of other Texas counties in its path, including a few counties in Louisiana.  ""Take cover now!"" the National Weather Service warned in all caps in its weather update around 13:00 CDT (19:00 BST) for residents in Louisiana's Northeastern Beauregard Parish. ""Move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows."" Earlier, the city of Galveston, south-east of Houston, issued a voluntary evacuation order for some areas. Storm surges in the Galveston area were predicted to reach 4-6ft above ground.  In Surfside Beach, police posted a photo of flood waters rising above the lower part of a truck's door, feet above the ground.  The director of the US National Hurricane Center, Michael Brennan, has warned those living in Beryl's path to find a safe place to be through Monday ""as hazardous conditions will persist even after the centre of Beryl moves through"". ""There's a very considerable risk of flash flooding across the Texas Gulf Coast, eastern Texas, ArkaTex [Arkansas-Texas] region. ""Do not ignore this very serious storm,"" urged Acting Governor Dan Patrick.  The ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Freeport and Texas City have all closed, meaning there could be a temporary halt to exports.  All vessel movement and cargo operations have been restricted.  Refugio County, north of Galveston, on Saturday issued a mandatory evacuation - stating the limited capacity of emergency services staff, 4 July holiday traffic and the area's weakened infrastructure from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as reasons.  Nueces County, meanwhile, ordered the mandatory evacuation of visitors and strongly encouraged locals to leave as well.  More than 2,000 emergency responders have been made ready to deal with Beryl's  aftermath, Mr Patrick announced, including members of the Texas National Guard.  Beryl is expected to move east across America's central states, including Mississippi, later in the week.  In the process, it will likely skip over central and west Texas, areas that are currently experiencing moderate to severe levels of drought.  Hurricane Beryl has been an unprecedented storm. At one stage, it became the earliest Category Five hurricane ever recorded. It has already left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean - hitting islands including St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union, and Grenada especially hard. The storm was also one of the most powerful to ever hit Jamaica and left hundreds of thousands of people without power. Beryl brought heavy rain to the tourist hotspots of Cancún and Tulum in southern Mexico. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages. While it is difficult to attribute specific storms to climate change as the causes are complex, exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful. It is the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season but the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y49gwln0o,"Kathryn Armstrong and Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-08 21:09:47,
177,How fetching water is holding back India's women,"Fetching drinking water is a gruelling daily routine for millions of women in India. Even without enduring the scorching summer months or the freezing winters, they walk for miles every day, balancing plastic or earthen pots on their heads and carrying buckets in their hands to manage the household water stock. “It’s a daily struggle. I get so tired that I collapse when I’m done,” says Sunita Bhurbade from Tringalwadi, a tribal village 180km (112 miles) from India’s financial hub, Mumbai. Ms Bhurbade spends four-to-five hours every day travelling back and forth from her nearest reliable water source - a dry lake - to fill her pots. The water is dirty and she has to dig holes on the side for the water to filter through naturally and seep in. “For four-to-five months every year, women have no option but to fetch water from long distances because nearby wells and water sources dry up,” she says. Ironically, her village receives one of the heaviest rainfalls in the region. Because of this daily grind, she constantly complains of back and neck pain, fatigue and weakness. The daily rigour also bars her and other women from her village from pursing a paid job. “No-one will hire me even as a farm labourer because they won’t allow me to show up at work in the afternoon,” she says. ""If I go after water, I have to sacrifice my livelihood. If I try to earn a wage, my family stays thirsty.” According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef, 1.8 billion people worldwide collect drinking water from supplies located off premises, and in seven out of 10 households, women and girls are primarily responsible for water collection. This is particularly true in India where, experts say, the need to secure drinking water is holding women back and hindering economic growth. “First, women can’t take up paid work because they have to do all the household chores and secondly, even if they wish to find some work after doing their daily chores, there are not enough paid jobs for women in rural India,"" says Prof Ashwini Deshpande, who heads the economics department in Delhi's Ashoka University. The value of women’s unpaid labour in Indian economy is huge. India’s largest commercial bank State Bank of India (SBI)’s Ecowrap report indicates that the total contribution of unpaid women's work to the economy is around 22.7bn rupees ($276.8m; £216.7m), almost 7.5% of India’s total GDP. The NGO International Development Organisation estimates that Indian women spend 150 million work days every year fetching water. Experts say that if women can spend this time in paid activities, they can be financially independent and it can also boost the economy. The Indian government says it is constantly working to improve water infrastructure countrywide. By January 2024, it said it had provided piped water to almost 74% of rural households. For those who had to earlier fetch water from outside but are now getting piped water in their homes, the experience has been life-changing. “I open the tap, water comes rushing… it’s like a dream. I had been fetching water since I was five,” says Mangal Khadke, who’s married and in her 30s and lives about 30km from Ms Bhurbade. But there are still millions who lack access to tap water.  Around 700km away from Tringalwadi, in the Aaki village of central India’s Amaravati district,  village head Indrayani Javarkar spends most of her day finding and collecting water. “It’s so dry here in the summer that every day I wake up with one thought in my mind: where can I find water today?” she says. Indrayani has two jobs: first, find and collect water for her family, and second, to organise water tankers for her village.  ""Both the tasks are getting harder every day,"" she says.  Ms Bhurbade says getting tap water for her is still a distant dream.  “[Women] start when they are children themselves. Someone hands them a small bucket and says, fetch what you can carry. And then, it’s a lifetime's obligation - until she dies, she is fetching water,"" she says. Ms Bhurbade doesn’t remember a single year where she didn’t have to walk miles with a pot on her head. We asked what she would do if she didn’t have to fetch water and had spare time. She thinks hard and says she likes to sing. But her songs are also about water. ""Radu nako bala mi panyala jate,"" she sings for us. It means: ""Don’t cry my child, I am going to fetch water.""",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e47zgz2v7o,"Anagha Pathak,",2024-07-07 23:09:47,
176,Masoud Pezeshkian: The reformist former heart surgeon now Iran's president-elect,"Wildcard candidate Masoud Pezeshkian will become Iran's first reformist president in almost two decades, after he defeated hardliner Saeed Jalili in a run-off election on Friday. The 69-year-old former heart surgeon and health minister campaigned on promises to moderate Iran’s conservative outlook and improve relations with the West. He criticised the country’s notorious morality police and called for negotiations over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal. But analysts remain sceptical about his ability to enact meaningful change within an establishment dominated by ultraconservatives. When Mr Pezeshkian's name was confirmed on the ballot four weeks ago, following the death of hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, even his most loyal supporters were shocked that he had made it past the Guardian Council.  The powerful body of clerics and jurists which vets candidates' religious and revolutionary credentials had barred many prominent reformists and moderates from standing in recent elections, including Mr Pezeshkian himself for the last presidential poll in 2021. But once his candidacy was approved this time, Mr Pezeshkian carefully balanced promises of change with declarations of loyalty to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority in the country. In a celebratory speech, he praised the ""guidance"" of Ayatollah Khamenei, saying he would not have been able to succeed without him. With Iran facing a struggling economy, a shadow-war with Israel that burst into the open earlier this year, and continuing discontent over the violent crackdown on the women-led protests that erupted in 2022, the fact that Mr Pezeshkian was even allowed to stand could be a sign that the Supreme Leader wishes to soften the government's stance on certain issues. Masoud Pezeshkian was born in 1954 in the city of Mahabad, in the north-western province of West Azerbaijan. He is of mixed Azeri-Kurdish ancestry and grew up speaking both languages, giving him broad appeal among the ethnic minority groups which make up more than a third of Iran’s population of 89 million. He studied medicine in the years before the 1979 Islamic revolution - and as a fresh-faced doctor he organised medical assistance for wounded soldiers during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. He specialized in cardiac surgery after the conflict. In 1994, Mr Pezeshkian faced personal tragedy when his wife and son were killed in a car crash. He chose not to remarry, raising his daughter and two remaining sons alone - a story he told along the campaign trail, promising supporters: “As I was loyal to my family, I will be loyal to you.” He rose up the political ranks in the early 2000s, serving as health minister during the second term of reformist President Mohammad Khatami’s government between 2001 and 2005. He has represented the north-western city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008 and was a deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020. After a crackdown on the unrest that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election, Mr Pezeshkian drew attention for his criticism of the government's treatment of protesters, which spurred a backlash from Iran’s hard-line politicians. Mr Pezeshkian's candidacy in this year's presidential election was backed by major reformist groups and endorsed by Mr Khatami, as well as the moderate former president Hassan Rouhani. He finished narrowly ahead of Saeed Jalili in the election's first round, for which turnout was a record low of 40% amid calls for a boycott from opponents of the clerical establishment.  Turnout was almost 10 percentage points higher for the run-off, in which Mr Pezeshkian received 53.7% of the votes cast. In a post on X following his victory, Mr Pezeshkian told Iranians that it marked the beginning of a ""partnership"".  ""The difficult path ahead cannot be smoothed without your co-operation, sympathy and trust. I extend my hand to you and swear by my honour I will not leave you alone in this course. Do not leave me alone,"" he wrote. Although Mr Pezeshkian is considered to be a reformist, he often emphasises his devotion to the Supreme Leader. He has described himself as a ""reformist principlist"" and said: ""I am a principlist, and it is for these principles that we seek reform."" In the context of Iranian politics, ""principlist"" refers to conservative supporters of the Supreme Leader who advocate for protecting the ideological principles of the 1979 revolution's early days. Observers believe that it will be Mr Pezeshkian's ability to straddle reformist and principlist agendas that will be crucial to his success.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmm25dq14j3o,"Tom Bennett & BBC Persian,",2024-07-08 17:09:47,
174,Anchorman actor pleads guilty over Capitol riot,"Comedian Jay Johnston, best known for his work in the animated hit Bob's Burgers, has pleaded guilty over his involvement in the 6 January US Capitol riot. Mr Johnston admitted on Monday to a single count of obstructing officers during a civil disorder. He will be sentenced in October and faces up to five years in federal prison. More than 540 Capitol riot participants have served time behind bars. Mr Johnston, 55, has acting credits in Hollywood going back to the mid-1990s. He acted and wrote for all four season of HBO's Mr Show with Bob and David, starred in all three seasons of Comedy Central's The Sarah Silverman Program, and had a recurring role on the Fox sitcom Arrested Development. The Illinois native has also appeared in movies such as Anchorman and Men in Black II. Internet sleuths identified him as a participant in the 6 January riot from a social media post by the FBI in March 2021. Authorities have said he ""participated with other rioters in a group assault"" on police officers protecting a Capitol entrance and ""helped carry a stolen police riot shield out"". According to court documents, Mr Johnson also admitted to an acquaintance by text message that he had been there. “The news has presented it as an attack. It actually wasn’t,"" he wrote.  ""Thought it kind of turned into that. It was a mess. Got maced and tear gassed and I found it quite untastic.” That December, amid the allegations, Mr Johnston was fired from Bob's Burgers. He voiced fan-favourite character Italian restaurateur Jimmy Pesto. The character was recast in 2023 and returned to the show for its latest season. Mr Johnston was arrested in California last summer and initially charged on four counts. His plea agreement saw him admit to a single civil disorder charge while the other three offences were dropped. His sentencing hearing is set for 7 October. Nearly 1,500 people have been charged over their role in the violence that unfolded in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, according to the justice department.

173,'I had to downgrade my life' - US workers in debt to buy groceries,"Stacey Ellis, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania, should be the kind of voter that US President Joe Biden can count on. But after four years of rising prices, her support has worn thin – and every time she shops at the supermarket, she is reminded how things have changed for the worse. Ms Ellis works full-time as a nurse’s assistant and has a second part-time job. But she needs to economise. She has switched stores, cut out brand-name items like Dove soap and Stroehmann bread, and all but said goodbye to her favourite Chick-fil-A sandwich. Still, Ms Ellis has sometimes turned to risky payday loans (short-term borrowing with high interest rates) as she grapples with grocery prices that have surged 25% since Mr Biden entered office in January 2021. ""Prior to inflation,"" she says, ""I didn't have any debt, I didn't have any credit cards, never applied for like a payday loan or any of those things. But since inflation, I needed to do all those things....I’ve had to downgrade my life completely."" The leap in grocery prices has outpaced the historic 20% rise in living costs that followed the pandemic, squeezing households around the country and fuelling widespread economic and political discontent. ""I’m a Democrat,"" says Ms Ellis, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown. ""I love voting for them. But Republicans are speaking volumes right now and Democrats are whispering."" “I want somebody to help me, help the American people,"" she adds. “Joe Biden, where are you?” For the president, already contending with serious doubts about his age and fitness for another term, the cost-of-living issue presents a major challenge, threatening to dampen turnout among supporters in an election that could be decided, like the last two, by several tens of thousands of votes in a handful key states.  Across the country, Americans on average spent more than 11% of their incomes on food, including restaurant meals last year – a higher proportion than any time since 1991. The jump in food prices has hit younger, lower-income and minority households -  key parts of the coalition that helped Mr Biden win the White House in 2020 - especially hard. But worries about the issue are widespread: a Pew survey earlier this year found that 94% of Americans were at least somewhat concerned about rising food and consumer goods prices. That was nearly identical to two years earlier, even though the staggering jumps in food prices that hit the US and other countries after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine have subsided. Dylan Garcia, a 26-year-old security guard from Brooklyn, says he’s never struggled to buy groceries as much as he has now. Instead of the fresh food and brand-name items he used to enjoy, he now stocks up on ramen noodles and frozen vegetables - and only eats twice a day because he can't afford more. At checkout, he routinely uses ""buy now, pay later” schemes, which allow him to pay the bill in installments, but have led to mounting debt. “I’m stuck in a loop,” he says. “It’s become an insecurity to pull up my phone at the register and have to use these programmes. When they see me, it’s embarrassing.” Mr Garcia, who has long voted for Democrats, says his precarious financial situation has made him lose hope in politics and he does not plan to vote in November's election. “I don’t think the government has our best interest and I don’t think they care,” he says. The White House maintains Mr Biden has been engaged on issues of food affordability, fighting to increase food stamp benefits and other government aid, initiatives opposed by Republicans.  At last month's presidential debate, the first question was on inflation, and Mr Biden sought to shift blame to big companies, accusing them of price gouging – a claim that is hotly disputed among economists. But despite strong job creation and low unemployment, opinion polls show voters continue to trust Mr Biden's opponent, former President Donald Trump, more on economic issues. On the CNN debate stage, the Republican White House candidate blamed Mr Biden for stoking inflation, which the White House denies, and said: “It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can’t.” The Trump campaign in turn denies that policies he proposes - including a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the US - would worsen price rises, as many analysts predict.  ""We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the US's economic standing in the world, and a destabilizing effect on the US's domestic economy,"" wrote 16 Nobel prize-winning economists in an open letter last month. Republicans have accused Mr Biden of trying to mislead the public about the extent of the inflation problem, noting that Mr Biden has claimed, incorrectly, that inflation was already at 9% when he entered office. It was 1.4%. Katie Walsh, a makeup artist in Pennsylvania, voted for Trump in 2020 and says she plans to do so again, based on his economic record. The 39-year-old says her family has struggled to keep up with inflation, especially since her business has slowed, as people squeezed by higher prices cut back. ""I know he's a big fat mouth,"" she says of Mr Trump. ""But he at least knows how to run the economy."" Analysts say it is clear that the economy is important to voters, but less clear it will prove decisive in the November election. In 2022, when inflation was at its worst, Democrats did better than expected in mid-term elections, as concerns about abortion access drove supporters to the polls.  This time around, issues such as immigration and fitness for office are also top of many voters' minds, while economic trends appear to be moving in the right direction. Grocery prices were up just 1% over the past 12 months, well within historic norms; and the cost of a few items, including rice, fish, apples, potatoes, and milk, has even come down a bit. As major chains such as Target, Amazon and Walmart announce price cuts in recent weeks, there are signs the situation could continue to improve. Some analysts also expect wages, which have increased but trailed the leap in overall prices, to finally catch up this year, providing further relief. “We’re on the right track,” says Sarah Foster, who follows the economy for  Bankrate.com. “Wage growth has slowed, price growth has slowed but, you know, prices are slowing at a much faster rate than wages.” Stephen Lemelin, a 49-year-old father of two from Michigan, another electoral battleground, says he was pleasantly surprised by lower prices on a recent supermarket trip. Whatever his concerns about the economy, the military veteran says his support for Mr Biden, who got his vote in 2020, has never been in doubt, given that he sees Trump as a threat to democracy. “Nobody likes high interest rates or high inflation but that’s not under presidential control,” he says. “If you know politics, there’s really only one choice.”",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx002795738o,"Natalie Sherman and Nathalie Jimenez,",2024-07-07 23:09:47,
172,What's the right punishment for 'too big to fail' Boeing?,"Boeing is one of the largest and most important companies in the United States. Arguably, it is too big to fail. But is it also too big to be held to account? The company is one of the world’s two main manufacturers of large commercial jets. It ranks among the top five US defence contractors. It employs more than 170,000 people globally, including 150,000 in the US, and generated revenues of nearly $78bn (£60bn) last year. It makes a vital contribution to the US economy. But its commitment to safety has repeatedly been called into question, most recently following an incident earlier this year in which a disused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max minutes after takeoff. Whistleblowers have since made a series of claims about alleged unsafe practices in Boeing’s factories, as well as in those of its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. Critics say the company has not taken its problems seriously - and that regulators, cowed by the firm's importance, are not taking the steps necessary to force Boeing to fix its problems.  A new deal for the firm has amplified those claims.  This week, the firm agreed to plead guilty to an existing criminal fraud charge,  which was brought after two near-identical crashes involving Boeing's brand new 737 Max, that occurred more than five years ago, killing 346 people. Family members of many of those killed have said the agreement, which will be submitted to a judge for approval, is far too lenient. ""The plea deal with Boeing unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons,"" their lawyer Paul Cassell wrote in a written objection to the deal. The deal stems from an investigation that started in 2019, after the second crash. Investigators later concluded that Boeing had cut corners during the design of its 737 Max, and deceived regulators. Boeing was accused of putting profits ahead of passenger safety.  In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.5bn settlement, but avoided prosecution on a criminal fraud conspiracy charge. But in May the Department of Justice (DoJ) found Boeing broke the terms of that settlement by not implementing and enforcing a suitable compliance and ethics programme. As part of its guilty plea, Boeing agreed to pay a $243.6m penalty and submit to independent monitoring for three years.  It also agreed that its board of directors would meet with victims' families and pledged to invest some $455m in safety improvements.  Erin Applebaum, a lawyer who represents 34 families who lost loved ones on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, said the deal was ""nothing more than a slap on the wrist and will do nothing to effectuate meaningful change within the company"".  The DoJ said the agreement did not preclude action against any individual executives or against the company for conduct that occurred after the 2018 and 2019 crashes.  But officials left some key questions - such as how the guilty plea would affect Boeing's ability to bid for government work - unanswered. In Washington, the agreement was greeted by some calls from lawmakers for further action. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has led hearings focused on Boeing's retaliation against whistleblowers said, individuals, not just the company, should face consequences ""for past illegalities as well as continuing retaliation against whistleblowers & other wrongdoing"". ""This plea deal cannot be the end of Boeing’s accountability,""  he wrote on social media. ""The need for ongoing aggressive investigative efforts and other action is obvious."" ""Regardless of the DOJ’s efforts, Congress must not let up on its own oversight of both Boeing and the FAA, and that is something I plan to continue to pursue,” Senator Tammy Duckworth added. Before the deal was announced, others had expressed concerns that Boeing was too important to be held fully accountable. ""I’ll go back to the reality of the fact that we all want Boeing to succeed,” Republican Senator Ron Johnson said at a hearing in April. “We don’t want to think that there are conditions in these planes that should really force regulators to ground these planes - what that would do to our economy, what that would do to people’s lives."" Analysts said there was little doubt Boeing’s status as a major contractor to the US military would have been a key factor in deciding what action to take against the company. In 2022 alone, it racked up more than $14bn worth of contracts with the Department of Defense. ""That may matter the most regarding not the direct terms of the plea, but rather the negotiations over possible debarment or suspension from contracting,"" said Prof Brandon Garrett of Duke University School of Law, who tracks corporate prosecutions. There is also Boeing’s position in the commercial aviation market to consider.  The crises have already taken a heavy toll on the company, which has lost money every year since 2019, a sum totalling more than $30bn. But the market currently needs Boeing if airlines are to obtain the planes they need.  The aerospace giant currently has orders for more than 6,000 jets, representing years of production. Its great rival Airbus has an even larger backlog, and has been struggling to produce enough planes to meet demand. In the future the company will also have to be in good shape if it is to see off the threat from an emerging rival. ""Boeing's too big to fail, but it's not too big to be mediocre,"" says Ronald Epstein, a managing director at Bank of America, who follows the firm. Chinese state-backed manufacturer Comac is now producing the C919 passenger jet, a potential rival to the 737 Max and Airbus A320 neo. It began commercial flights in May. Its order book is tiny compared to those of Airbus and Boeing but in the longer term it could profit from any weakness at the American giant. There is also potential for Brazil’s Embraer, a successful manufacturer for smaller regional airlines, to move into the space occupied by Boeing and Airbus. All of this may explain why the DoJ has not imposed steeper penalties on Boeing. Nevertheless, the company has admitted to a serious crime. That in itself is a major development. The question now is whether the DoJ has done enough to deter future wrongdoing.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2jeg14r9o,"Natalie Sherman and Theo Leggett,",2024-07-08 17:09:47,
171,Accused of witchcraft then murdered for land,"BBC Africa Eye investigates a shocking spate of elderly people accused of witchcraft then murdered along Kenya’s Kilifi coast, and discovers the true motives behind the killings. Seventy-four-year-old Tambala Jefwa stares vacantly out of his one remaining eye as his wife, Sidi, gently removes his shirt. “They stabbed him with a knife like this and pulled,” she says pointing to the long scar stretching down from his collar bone. She takes his head in her hands showing what happened in another attack. “They had to pull the scalp back and sew it together.” Mr Jefwa was accused of being a witch and has been attacked twice in his home, 80km (50 miles) inland from the coastal town of Malindi. The first left him without an eye. The second nearly killed him. The couple own more than 30 acres of land where they grow maize and raise a few chickens. There has been a dispute with family members over boundaries. They believe this was the real reason Mr Jefwa was almost killed, not that people genuinely believed he was a witch. “I was left for dead. I lost so much blood. I don’t know why they attacked me, but it can only be the land,” says Mr Jefwa. Belief in witchcraft and superstition is common in many countries. But in parts of Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and South Africa, it can be used to justify killing elderly people to take their land. A report called, The Aged, on Edge, by Kenyan human rights organisation Haki Yetu says one elderly person is murdered along the Kilifi coast every week in the name of witchcraft. Its programme officer, Julius Wanyama, says many families believe it is one of their own who orders the killing. “They use the word witchcraft as a justification because they will get public sympathy. And people will say: ‘If he was a witch, it is good you have killed him.’” Few people in this region have title deeds for their land. Without a will, they rely on passing it down customarily through the family. Mr Wanyama says seven out of 10 of the killings are elderly men because land ownership and inheritance lie with them. “Historically people here in Kilifi do not have [land] documentation. The only document they have is the narrative from these elderly people. That is why mostly men are being killed, because once you kill them, then you have removed the obstacle,” says Mr Wanyama. About an hour’s drive from the Jefwa family land is a rescue centre for the elderly run by the charity, Malindi District Association. It is home to around 30 elderly people who have been attacked and are unable to go back to their own land. Sixty-three-year-old Katana Chara, who looks much older than his years, has been here for around 12 months. He had to move to the centre after he was attacked with a machete in his bedroom in April 2023. One hand was cut off at the wrist, the other just above the elbow. He can no longer work and needs help for the most basic tasks, from feeding and washing to dressing himself. “I know the person who cut my hands, but we have never met face to face since,” he says. Mr Chara was accused of being a witch over the death of another man’s child, but believes the real reason he was attacked was because of his six acres of land. “I don’t have anything to do with witchcraft. I have one piece of land and it is at the seafront. It is a big piece of land.” Many of Mr Chara’s family members were questioned over the attack but no-one was ever prosecuted. Activist Mr Wanyama has been trying to get justice for him. “Very few people have been charged on the allegations of killings of elderly. And that’s why I think even the key people who are involved in killing, they feel they are free.” After months of investigating, BBC Africa Eye managed to track down an ex-hitman who claims to have killed around 20 people. He says the minimum he got paid for each murder was 50,000 Kenyan shillings – around $400 (£310). “If someone kills an old person, know that their family paid for it. It must be their family,” he tells BBC Africa Eye. Pushed on how and why he thought it was his right to take someone’s life, he responds: “I may have done something bad because I was given the job and it is me that killed, but according to laws, according to God, the person who sent me is the guilty one.” The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights presented a document to the United Nations in February 2023 stating: “Witch burning, killings, and physical attacks are rife in regions such as Kisii in western Kenya and Kilifi county in coastal Kenya.”  It went on to say that younger family members seeking to acquire family land is a key motivating factor behind the killings. It said the attacks and killings increased during periods of drought and famine when sources of income become scarce. Mr Wanyama says killings which use accusations of witchcraft to justify land grabs have become a “national disaster” “It started as a regional issue, but now it has escalated... If we don’t address it, then we are losing our archives of the elderly. Those are the only live archives we can believe.” In traditional African culture, the elderly are revered for their wisdom and knowledge.  In Kilifi, it is the reverse. Old people are so fearful of becoming a target, many dye their hair in an attempt to look younger. It is rare for someone in this region to survive after being accused of witchcraft. While Mr Chara is safe now he lives at the rescue centre for the elderly, for men like Mr Jefwa there is real fear that whoever tried to murder him will come back.

170,'You're not welcome here': Australia’s treatment of disabled migrants,"When Luca was born in a Perth hospital two years ago, it flipped his parents’ world in ways they never expected. With the joy came a shocking diagnosis: Luca had cystic fibrosis. Then Australia - Laura Currie and her husband Dante’s home for eight years - said they couldn't stay permanently. Luca, his parents were told, could be a financial burden on the country. “I think I cried for like a week - I just feel really, really sorry for Luca,” Ms Currie says. “He's just a defenceless two-and-a-half-year-old and doesn't deserve to be discriminated against in that way.” With a third of its population born abroad, Australia has long seen itself as a “migration nation” - a multicultural home for immigrants that promises them a fair go and a fresh start. The idea is baked into its identity. But the reality is often different, especially for those who have a disability or a serious medical condition. It is one of few countries that routinely rejects immigrants’ visas on the basis of their medical needs - specifically if the cost of care exceeds A$86,000 ($57,000; £45,000) over a maximum of 10 years. New Zealand has a similar policy but Australia's is much stricter.  The government defends the law as necessary to curb government spending and protect citizens' access to healthcare. It says these visas aren’t technically rejected. But neither are they granted. Some can apply for a waiver, although not all visas allow it. They could also appeal the decision but the process is lengthy and expensive. Campaigners see this as discriminatory and out of step with modern attitudes towards disability. And after years of fighting for it, they are hoping for change in the coming weeks, with an official review of the health requirements under way. Laura Currie and Dante Vendittelli had moved from Scotland for jobs that Australia desperately needs. She is a nursery teacher and he is a painter-decorator. They had started their application for permanent residency before Luca was born. But now they feel like the life they built here and the taxes they paid meant little. “It's like, we're here for you [Australia] when you need us, but when the roles are reversed and we need you, it's like, nope, sorry, you cost too much money, you go back to your own country.” Australia has form when it comes to its strict immigration policies. It had its own version of “stop the boats”, which sent people arriving by boat to offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Island of Nauru and made controversial headlines in recent years. It was only in the 1970s that it entirely rid itself of the “White Australia” policy that started in 1901 with the Immigration Restriction Act, which limited the number of non-white immigrants. The disability and health discriminations, which also date back to 1901, are still in place, says Jan Gothard, an immigration lawyer: ""We still treat people with disability in the same way as we did in 1901 and we think they're not people who are welcome in Australia.” She is part of Welcoming Disability, an umbrella group that’s been pressuring the government to overhaul the law. Surprisingly, Australia's Migration Act is exempt from its own Disability Discrimination Act. Put simply, it doesn’t matter how long you’ve lived in Australia, if you were born in Australia, if you have private health insurance or even if you can pay for the support yourself - if you are deemed too much of a financial burden, you will fail the health requirement. The government says that 99% of visa applicants meet the health requirement - 1,779 of them did not meet the bar between 2021 and 2022, according to official figures. Immigration minister Andrew Giles, who declined to be interviewed, recently said that “any child born in Australia and adversely affected by the migration health rules can apply for ministerial intervention”, and that he himself had “positively intervened” in cases. But families say that the process is gruelling at an already difficult time. ""There's so much in your life going on when a child is sick, so much struggle and you're struggling and begging and asking for petitions, asking people to help you,” says Mehwish Qasim, who knows the challenge first-hand. She and her husband Qasim fought to stay in Australia in a case that drew global attention. Their son Shaffan was born in 2014 with a rare genetic condition and a damaged spinal cord. He needs around-the-clock care. The couple, originally from Pakistan, intended to return eventually, but Shaffan's birth changed everything. Now, getting on a plane would risk his life. Finally, in 2022 they were told they could stay. For those eight years, Qasim, a trained accountant, was unable to work in his chosen profession. Instead, he found jobs in cafes, in supermarkets and taxi apps to make ends meet. “They should realise that's a very difficult situation - you shouldn't put people in the limelight,” Ms Qasim says. Ms Currie and her husband aren’t giving up either - Australia is home now for Luca and they are filling jobs that the country needs. They’re hoping that is enough to win them their appeal. If they lose, they will have 28 days to leave the country. For Luca, the sticking point is a pricey drug, Trikafta. He is not on it and may not even be compatible with it. But it’s the basis of Australian estimates of his treatment - around A$1.8m That puts his medical costs over the permissible limit - A$86,000 over 10 years, also known as the Significant Cost Threshold. While campaigners have welcomed the recent rise of the threshold - from A$51,000 to A$86,000 - they still don’t think it reflects average costs. The government’s own data shows that Australia spent $9,365 per head on health goods and services in 2021-2022 and a further A$8,245 per person on welfare costs. Over a 10-year period - the maximum period assessed for a visa - that would amount to more than A$170,000. So campaigners have questioned how the government comes up with the threshold, which is half of that amount. They also want the cost of educational support to be removed from the calculations. This impacts families whose children have been diagnosed with conditions such as Down Syndrome, ADHD and autism. It’s a snag that has hit Claire Day’s plans for her and her family to follow her brother, who moved to Australia a few years ago. Her younger daughter Darcy, who is nearly 10, has Down Syndrome. She's been told by migration experts that because of that, she has little chance of being granted a visa. On an overcast afternoon in Kent, she talks wistfully of the life she is looking forward to Down Under. Sunshine is no small attraction, but also “the lifestyle - [I want] a better environment for the children to grow up in,” she says. An officer with London’s Metropolitan Police force for 21 years, she wants to take advantage of a major recruitment drive by Australian police forces. Their social media feeds are full of promotional videos fronted by former British police officers, showing them living the Australian dream, patrolling the beach in sand buggies and relaxing in the surf. They make up just some of the 30,000 British people who moved to Australia last year, according to government statistics. Ms Day has not one, but two job offers - from Queensland’s police force and from South Australia. As part of the job, she’s also entitled to a permanent visa. Now, she is not so sure. “I had hoped that it wouldn't be an issue because Darcy doesn't have any medical problems. She's fit and she's healthy, she goes to school and she participates in clubs and all of that sort of stuff.” Stories like this have convinced campaigners that, at its heart, the policy is ableist. “If we say to people with disability, ‘you’re not welcome here, we're saying directly to people living with disability in this country, ‘you’re not welcome here either,” Dr Gothard says.  ""[We're saying] you know, given the opportunity, we would rather not have you.” Social worker Shizleen Aishath says she was “gobsmacked” to find out about the health requirement - and she discovered it the hard way. A former UN employee, she came to Australia for a further degree with every intention of returning to the Maldives. But she had an emergency C-section when her son Kayban was born in 2016. Forceps were used during the delivery. Kayban had undiagnosed haemophilia and suffered a serious brain bleed. He now needs round-the-clock care and the family chose to stay in Australia. But Kayban was refused a temporary visa because he was deemed too much of a burden - although the family have private health insurance and don’t use state resources. The rest of the family were granted their visas. “Disability is the only thing that stops you from migrating, there is nothing else,” Ms Aishath says. After a lengthy appeal, Kayban was allowed to remain. His family is now preparing for their next fight - to stay in Australia indefinitely.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr70ezev2mo,"Katy Watson,",2024-07-08 15:09:47,
169,Justin Bieber performs at India's mega wedding,"Justin Bieber has become the latest in a string of international stars to perform for the son of India's richest man and his wife-to-be as they celebrate their upcoming wedding. The Canadian singer flew in to perform for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant - along with their guests - in Mumbai at the weekend. He had a lot to live up to. The couple's first pre-wedding party featured Rihanna, while the second - a cruise around the Mediterranean - had performances from 90s teen heartthrobs The Backstreet Boys, singer Katy Perry and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. So it is with bated breath that Ambani wedding-watchers - of whom there are now legions around the globe - await news of who will perform at the actual wedding itself this weekend. Rumours swirling on the internet suggest it could be Adele, but the family are remaining tight-lipped. No expense is being spared on the wedding of Mukesh Ambani's youngest son, putting it in a different league from even the most extravagant of Indian weddings. It outshines even his daughter’s nuptials, which featured a headline-grabbing performance by Beyoncé. Last weekend Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant celebrated their sangeet ceremony - a night of music and dance ahead of the wedding ceremony. In typical style, the Ambanis went above and beyond what would usually be expected by guests. It saw Mukesh Ambani, the head of Reliance Industries, with an estimated net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes, and the rest of the family take to the stage in their own choreographed dance to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s hit song, Deewangi Deewangi.  It was also another chance for wedding-watchers to pore over the outfits worn by the guests - which included some of India's most glamorous stars wearing dresses by the country’s top fashion designers.  It seems as much as the pre-wedding events have been concerts, they have also become catwalks, with stars sharing professional shots on their social media accounts ahead of the parties. The cost of the three parties to date is not known. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Justin Bieber is said to be $10m. Exactly what the weekend's three-day event holds remains to be seen. For some in India, it will come as a relief that the wedding and its extravagance is over, while those in Mumbai will be hoping it does not make the city’s famously bad traffic any worse. Radhika was keeping her cards close to her chest when she told Vogue US last month that planning was ""going great"", adding: ""I’m very excited to be married.""",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1de8gzevpo,"Flora Drury,",2024-07-08 19:09:47,
168,White House fights back against doubts on Biden fitness,"The White House has fought back against questions about Joe Biden’s mental fitness, with the US president telling anxious fellow Democrats it is time to end the criticism, and daring doubters in the party to challenge him. In a tense news conference, the president's spokeswoman rejected suggestions that he might be suffering from an undisclosed illness. Mr Biden, 81, himself took the unusual step of calling in to MSNBC's morning show, saying: ""I am not going anywhere."" Questions about the president's mental acuity have intensified since a poor debate performance against Donald Trump on 27 June. And the scrutiny is unlikely to fade this week as he hosts a summit in Washington for leaders of Nato countries. In Monday's daily press conference, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre rejected speculation that Mr Biden was being treated for Parkinson's disease, which can cause stiff movement and slurred speech. ""Has the president been treated for Parkinson's?"" she said. ""No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No."" An expert on Parkinson's disease from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington DC has visited the White House eight times since last year, the New York Times reports. But White House records show the same doctor also made a number of visits during the Obama administration from 2012-16. Ms Jean-Pierre would not comment on the matter, citing the need to protect the privacy of the doctor and security reasons. On Monday, the president called in to left-leaning MSNBC's Morning Joe programme, laying down the gauntlet to critics to “challenge me at the convention” next month, or rally behind him against Trump. In a letter sent to congressional Democrats also on Monday, Mr Biden said he ""wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe"" that he could beat Trump, the Republican challenger in November's election. Mr Biden's letter said he had ""heard the concerns that people have"" and ""is not blind to them"", but that Democratic voters in the primaries have ""spoken clearly and decisively"" that he should be the party's nominee. ""Do we now just say this process didn't matter?"" the letter said. ""That the voters don't have a say... I decline to do that. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.""  It comes a day after the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, held a group call in which four congressmen were explicit in urging Mr Biden to step aside, according to US news outlets.  The quartet was joined by others who voiced concerns about Mr Biden's fitness for office after his stumbling debate performance, but stopped short of asking for the president to exit the race. Jerry Nadler of New York, Mark Takano of California and Adam Smith of Washington state all said Mr Biden should step aside, according to multiple outlets, citing people on the call or those familiar with what was said. Joe Morelle of New York added his voice, according to CBS and the New York Times, but the Associated Press said the fourth person was Jim Himes. On Monday, Mr Smith publicly called for Mr Biden to quit, saying in a statement ""the American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as president"". Others on the call expressed concern about Mr Biden's electoral chances against Trump. Last week, Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first Democrat in Congress to urge Mr Biden to step aside. Trump, 78, has ridiculed Mr Biden over the debate, last week labelling his rival ""broken-down"". Biden allies have expressed exasperation about the media criticism he is facing, while his Republican challenger was recently convicted in a New York hush-money case. Amid mounting speculation over Mr Biden's candidacy in November, the thoughts of some Democrats have turned to who could replace him.  Some party members have rallied around Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is Mr Biden's running mate in November.  Trump has suggested the vice-president would be ""better"" than Mr Biden, but still ""pathetic"". During a pair of interviews last week, Mr Biden acknowledged that he had ""screwed up"" the debate, but later vowed that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could convince him to end his bid to win the White House again.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2q0x3ekeezo,"Bernd Debusmann Jr, at the White House,",2024-07-08 22:09:47,
175,After France's election shock comes the real power struggle,"The drama and vitriol of France’s sudden summer election is over. Now comes the drama and vitriol of stage two - and what could be a much longer and equally agitated struggle to build a functional coalition out of the inconclusive results of Saturday’s vote. “A lot of things are unclear. We know who lost but we don’t know who won. Can we learn the art of compromise which is so unusual for us? Nobody knows - the signs are not necessarily good,” Sylvie Kauffmann, a newspaper columnist for Le Monde, told me. The risks of deadlock – for France itself, for its constitutional order, for European stability, and even for Ukraine’s war against Russian aggression – are serious. But it’s worth remembering that this country is no stranger to coping with political upheavals. Revolutions aside, there was the chaos and revolts that followed World War Two and eventually upended France’s constitutional order, leading to the current system of government, known as the Fifth Republic. And more recently there were the challenges of “cohabitation”, when presidents and prime ministers from rival parties were obliged to share power. As politicians now sidle away for their summer holidays, or refocus their attention on the imminent Paris Olympics, it seems more than likely that the political temperature in France will subside by a degree or two, at least briefly. But the cohabitation battles of the 1980s and 1990s look like gentlemanly squabbles over a wine menu compared with the furious, guillotines-at-dawn brawls that many observers expect to preoccupy France’s National Assembly for weeks, or even months, to come. Some wonder if the French electorate – by saddling parliament with three minority blocks of almost equal size – has rendered the country “ungovernable,” or whether it is simply faced with the sort of deal-making challenge that so many other European nations wrestle with almost as a matter of course. Having emerged, to almost universal surprise, with the most seats at this parliamentary election, France’s left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NPF) has now earned the right to pick – or try to pick - the next prime minister and to implement its agenda. But with no working majority, any viable candidate will need to win support from other, more centrist parties. Who could possibly fit that bill? The NPF was quick to unite around a common platform ahead of the elections. But it contains deep political rifts – stretching as it does from anti-capitalists and communists to mainstream social democrats. The coalition is also home to some divisive figures, like the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who could quickly trigger the coalition’s collapse over the factionalism that has often marked the left of French politics. Some wonder if the Green Party leader, Marine Tondelier, might be a good fit. Her relatively low profile could be an asset in a political landscape scarred by years of deeply personal, and sometimes vitriolic, feuding. In the midst of this, President Emmanuel Macron remains on his throne, scarred by self-inflicted political wounds, but arguably a little stronger than he was a few days ago. His centrist grouping lost almost a third of its seats in the National Assembly as a result of his entirely unnecessary electoral gamble to dissolve parliament and call elections. But a disciplined frenzy of deal-making with the NPF helped it cling onto many more seats in the second round than the pollsters predicted. Could deadlock in parliament enable Mr Macron to float above the chaos and strengthen his position? Even his allies seem sceptical, convinced he is now trapped in a “stranglehold” between the extremes he once promised to banish from French political life. “Today, the President of the Republic will maintain a small margin of manoeuvre to act. But he will no longer be the political programmatic driving force in the country. From this point of view, after seven years, Macronism is dead,” Gilles Legendre, a disillusioned former MP who used to lead Macron’s party in the Assembly, told the BBC. As for the far-right National Rally (RN), it will no doubt recover quickly from the shock of Sunday night’s results, which prompted sombre silence at the party’s headquarters - a jarring contrast with the euphoric street celebrations by left-wing voters which swept through parts of Paris that same evening. The RN has already sought to reframe its third-place disappointment as the result of cynical deal-making by a “dishonest alliance” of its rivals, rather than evidence of its own shallow pool of credible candidates and its failure to convince enough French voters of the sincerity of its move away from the extreme right. The RN will surely try to promote its own agenda – including a clampdown on immigration and reforms of schools and policing. Its commitment to supporting Ukraine remains unclear, given the party’s recent support for the Kremlin and its occupation of Crimea. The RN must now be hoping that the Assembly is either deadlocked or dominated by an economically profligate far-left agenda that could further threaten France’s already strained budget. Months, or even years, of turmoil could then give the party a chance to portray itself as a stable and modernising force, thwarted by left-wing extremists and old elites. That in turn could, potentially, give the RN a good chance of increasing its vote share in any subsequent snap parliamentary election, or – and this is the real prize – sweeping its leader Marine Le Pen into the Presidency in 2027.

188,Hollywood icon Paramount agrees $28bn merger deal,"One of Hollywood's oldest companies, Paramount Global, has agreed to merge with independent film studio Skydance Media. Under the deal, Paramount's non-executive chair Shari Redstone will sell her family's controlling stake in the company in a complex transaction that will result in a new firm worth around $28bn (£21.9bn). It marks the end of an era for the Redstone family, whose late patriarch, Sumner Redstone, transformed a chain of drive-in cinemas into a vast media empire. As well as Paramount, the group includes the television networks CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV. ""Our hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount’s continued success in this rapidly changing environment,"" Ms Redstone said in a statement. According to the company its TV channels have a global reach of over 4.3 billion subscribers across more than 180 countries.  The merger would combine Paramount, home of classic films such as Chinatown and Breakfast at Tiffany's, with its financial partner on several recent big releases, including Top Gun: Maverick and Star Trek Into Darkness. Under the agreement, Skydance will invest around $8bn in Paramount, including paying $2.4bn for National Amusements, which controls the group. National Amusements owns just 10% of Paramount Group's shares but accounts for almost 80% of its voting rights. Paramount said it expected to close the deal by the summer of next year. Paramount Global traces its origins back more than a century to the founding of Paramount Pictures Corporation in 1914. The studio has made many hit films, including the Godfather, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible series. But the entertainment giant has struggled over the past decade. Paramount Global's shares have fallen by more than 75% in the last five years. Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, who founded US technology giant Oracle. The announcement came after eight months of negotiations that saw Redstone holding talks with a number of potential partners including Sony and private equity firm Apollo. In April, Paramount's chief executive Bob Bakish left the company after clashing with Ms Redstone over the planned Skydance deal. The deal comes as the global entertainment industry is being transformed by the  video-streaming revolution.",2024-07-08 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng95d737do,"Peter Hoskins,",2024-07-08 07:09:48,
189,Payout for widow of Pakistani journalist killed by Kenyan police,"A court in Kenya has awarded 10m shillings ($78,000; £61,000) in compensation to the widow of a prominent Pakistani journalist who was shot dead by police at a roadblock nearly two years ago.  Arshad Sharif was a TV anchor known for his robust criticism of Pakistan's powerful military leaders and corruption in politics.  The father-of-five received death threats that he flagged to Pakistan's top judge, before fleeing his home country to seek safety abroad. Sharif's killing two months later at the hands of police in the Kenyan town of Kajiado caused outrage, and the slow response by officials prompted UN experts to criticise both Kenya and Pakistan. Kenya's police had argued it was a case of mistaken identity but Sharif's widow, Javeria Siddique, said it was a contract killing carried out on behalf of an unnamed individual in Pakistan. On Monday, the Kajiado High Court rejected ruled that the Kenyan authorities had acted unlawfully and violated Sharif's right to life. It duly awarded Ms Siddique compensation plus interest until payment in full. ""Loss of life cannot be compensated in monetary terms nor is the pain and suffering the family must have gone through. But there's consensus that compensation is appropriate remedy for redress in violation of fundamental rights,"" said Justice Stella Mutuku as she delivered the verdict. The judge also ruled that Kenya's director of public prosecutions and the independent policing oversight authority had violated Sharif's rights by failing to prosecute the two police officers involved. The court has ordered both bodies to conclude investigations and charge the officers. Reacting to the ruling, the lawyer representing Sharif's widow, Ochiel Dudley, said ""this is a win for the family and a win for Kenyans in their quest for police accountability"". Sharif's widow, Ms Siddique, expressed her gratitude to the Kenyan judiciary but   added that her work was far from done. ""This ruling has come as a relief to me and my family, but I will not relent in getting maximum justice for my husband,"" she said. The BBC has asked the Kenyan authorities for their response to the ruling. The police had given conflicting police accounts of Sharif's death. One account claimed the 49-year-old was travelling in a Toyota Land Cruiser which officers mistook for a similar vehicle that had been reported stolen.  In another version of events, police claimed that one of the car passengers had opened fire and then officers responded by shooting back. Like her late husband, Ms Siddique is a journalist, and filed the lawsuit alongside the Kenya Union of Journalists and Kenya Correspondents Association last October. She and her co-petitioners were seeking transparency, an apology, and accountability from the Kenyan authorities for what they called Sharif's ""targeted assassination"".  She told the BBC she was still unable to get justice for her husband in Pakistan, but would continue to campaign for the protection of journalists and would seek the help of the UN and the Committee to Protect Journalists.

187,Liberian president cuts his salary by 40%,"Liberia's President Joseph Boakai has announced that he will slash his salary by 40%. His office said he hoped to set a precedent for ""responsible governance"" and demonstrate ""solidarity"" with Liberians. Government salaries have been under intense scrutiny recently as Liberians complain about the rising cost of living. Around one in five people live on less than $2 (£1.70) a day in the West African state. Mr Boakai revealed in February that his annual salary was $13,400. The cut will bring it down to $8,000.     Mr Boakai's move echoes that of his predecessor, George Weah, who took a 25% cut in his salary.  Some in the West African nation have hailed Mr Boakai's decision, but others wonder whether it is truly a sacrifice given that he also receives benefits like a daily allowance and medical cover.  The presidential office's budget is almost $3m this year.   Anderson D Miamen, from non-profit organisation the Centre of Transparency and Accountability in Liberia, said the president's pay cut is ""welcoming"". ""We just hope that the public will clearly see where the deductions will go and how they will be used to positively impact the lives of the people,” he told the BBC. W Lawrence Yealue II, whose organisation also campaigns for government transparency, described the president's decision as ""very commendable"" and said that ""leadership has to be provided from the top"". He added that hoped Mr Boakai's benefits would be reviewed in the budget for the next financial year. As well as reducing his salary, Mr Boakai has pledged to ""empower"" Liberia's Civil Service Agency to make sure public servants ""receive fair compensation for their contributions to the country"". Last week a group of lawmakers complained they had not received their official cars, which they needed to perform their duties.  As a form of protest, they turned up to parliament in tuk-tuks, known locally as keh keh, a common mode of transport for ordinary Liberians. Mr Boakai took office in January after defeating Mr Weah in a run-off election.  He vowed to tackle corruption and financial mismanagement. As well as declaring his assets since taking office, Mr Boakai has ordered an audit of the presidential office. The results have not yet been released. Mr Boakai has also beefed up the General Auditing Commission and the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission. Mr Weah's government was plagued by allegations of corruption, and lavish spending, which triggered mass protests as the cost of living spiralled for ordinary people.

185,'Tough to play' - Svitolina's pain after attacks on Ukraine,"This video can not be played Svitolina was emotional as she beat Wang Elina Svitolina found it ""extremely tough"" to play her Wimbledon fourth-round match after Russian strikes killed dozens of people and seriously damaged a children's hospital in her native Ukraine. Svitolina, 29, broke down in tears during an on-court interview after she beat China's Wang Xinyu to reach the quarter-finals. She played the match wearing a black ribbon on her white outfit, knowing there had been mass casualties from the assault on her homeland. ""Today was one of the most difficult matches in my life,"" said Svitolina. ""Mentally it was beyond anything I have ever faced but fails in comparison to what my people at home are going through."" The 2023 Wimbledon semi-finalist is one of Ukraine's most prominent athletes and has spoken regularly about the impact of the war on her country. After her 6-2 6-1 win, Svitolina said: ""It was a good performance from my side and it's a very difficult day today for Ukrainian people."" Svitolina trailed off as she began to cry, with the court two crowd offering sympathetic support. ""It was not easy to focus on the match,"" Svitolina added. ""It was very difficult to read the news and just to go on the court it's extremely tough. ""I'm happy I could play today and get a win."" Svitolina will face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals. Ukraine's Elina Svitolina is a two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist after runs in 2019 and 2023 Svitolina, a mother of one, said she did want to leave her room after seeing the news when she woke up. At least 36 people were confirmed dead and 140 were injured as a result of Russian missile attacks across Ukraine on Monday. The rare daytime attack killed at least 19 people in Kyiv, including two at the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - which sustained major damage. Svitolina, along with former Ukraine footballer Andriy Shevchenko and heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk, is an ambassador for United24, a fundraising organisation sent up by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier this year, Svitolina said many Ukrainians felt people have lost interest in their ongoing battle to repel the Russian invasion. She wants to use her on-court success to maintain awareness but admitted she feels ""guilt"" at being happy for reaching a Grand Slam quarter-final. ""Many people cannot leave the country. Many people are at war. Many people are fighting, defending our front lines,"" she said. ""We've been living with this feeling for over two years. It's nothing new. But yes [guilt] is not a pleasant feeling to have."" American Danielle Collins' Wimbledon career ended in defeat as the 11th seed was beaten by Czech Barbora Krejcikova under the roof on Court One. Collins, 30, announced in January that this season would be her last on the tour. The former Australian Open finalist was on her best run at Wimbledon, playing in her first fourth-round match, but was beaten 7-5 6-3 by 31st seed Krejcikova. Both players had chances in the opening set before Collins lost serve at 5-5. She was then broken early in the second and needed a medical timeout after injuring her leg while trailing 3-1. Former world number two Krejcikova, 28, broke twice more on her way to a convincing win. The 2022 French Open winner is into her first Wimbledon quarter-final and will face a fellow former Roland Garros champion, Jelena Ostapenko. Earlier on Court One, Latvian 13th seed Ostapenko beat unseeded Kazakh Yulia Putintseva 6-2 6-3 with a dominant performance. Ostapenko's powerful hitting from the baseline proved too much for Putintseva - the player who knocked out top seed Iga Swiatek in the previous round. This video can not be played Kalinskaya retires during second set due to injury against Rybakina Fourth seed Rybakina underlined why she is the new title favourite with a dominant performance against Anna Kalinskaya before her opponent retired injured. Rybakina was 6-3 3-0 ahead on Centre Court when Russian 17th seed Kalinskaya left the last-16 match in tears having been unable to recover from a wrist problem. Russian-born Kazakh player Rybakina is the highest seed left in the women's draw and will face Svitolina next. Rybakina, 25, is the only former Wimbledon champion left in the women’s draw, and her bid has been strengthened by Swiatek and Coco Gauff featuring in a flurry of big names knocked out over the weekend. Rybakina dropped serve in the first game of the match and trailed 3-1 in the opener, but she then won five consecutive games, with two breaks to love, to take the first set, and the procession continued until Kalinskaya forfeited the match.

186,Smelly planet 'reeks of rotten eggs',"A faraway planet known for its dire weather also whiffs of rotten eggs, according to a new study. Scientists studied the atmosphere of HD 189733 b, which has scorching temperatures and precipitation akin to raining glass, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Hydrogen sulphide, which also exists on Jupiter, makes up most of HD 189733 b's atmosphere, and emits a bit of a pong, according to researchers. The gas is also emitted during farts. Finding it here is one of the first detections of hydrogen sulphide on an exoplanet - or planet outside of our solar system. ""So, if your nose could work at 1000C ... the atmosphere would smell like rotten eggs,"" said Dr Guangwei Fu, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins who led the research. The study was published in the journal Nature. Although hydrogen sulphide is one of the gasses that indicate that distant planets might be home to alien organisms, researchers aren't searching for life on this planet because it's a gas giant, like Jupiter, and too hot. However, they say finding hydrogen sulphide here is a step toward understanding how planets form. James Webb is opening up a new vista in analysing the chemicals in faraway planets and so helping astronomers learn more about their origins. ""It's been quite a game changer. It's really revolutionising the field of astronomy. It has delivered the capability promised and it even exceeded our expectations in certain ways,"" said Dr Fu. The researcher plans to use information from the space telescope to study more planets.",2024-07-08 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjm901rdyjdo,"Maddie Molloy,",2024-07-08 15:09:48,
184,WTO chief warns against global trade breakdown,"Global trade “is not having the best of times at the moment”. That is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “We are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,” she tells the BBC. “Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.” In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Both Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West. President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips. Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports. EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. “We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,” he says. Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year. However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech. “What we've seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we've seen since the end of the Cold War.""  “The last few years, you've had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,” she said. That’s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis. “We're also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. “We're seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.” She warns that “it will be costly for the world” to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (£5.8tn) of lost output in the long run. The EU’s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU. BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help. After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.” When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it’s “mind boggling” that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China’s economy has been growing steadily. Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: “I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.” The chamber’s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China. It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to “de-risk not de-couple” its relations with China. Brussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine. Companies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China. Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars. However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world. This year Panama Canal officials had to reduce the number of ships allowed to traverse the waterway. This is due to a lack of rainfall to fill the lake that feeds the canal. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal is effectively cut off because of ongoing attacks on commercial ships by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Traffic through the canal is down 90%, according to logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel. Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd, says this disruption means that the rates his firm charges are up between 30% and 40%. Whilst shipping costs are a small part of retail prices, Mr Habben Jansen says “these extra costs in the end get passed on” to consumers. That could end up pushing inflation up just as central banks are showing signs of getting it under control. That would be “detrimental to consumers,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. Despite all the tensions, she says trade has shown signs of resilience, and she adds that her organization can help countries solve their differences. Meanwhile, Dr Okonjo-Iweala admits that some WTO rules will need to change to help meet the challenge of climate change.  “I strongly believe that some of our [global trade] rules, we do need to look at them,"" she says. “When they were put in place, decades ago, we were not confronting the kind of climate change threats we confront today.” Regarding the increased use of tariffs, she adds: “We hope we don't have a repeat of what we saw in the 1930s. We had retaliatory tariffs, and it was downhill from there and everyone lost. “So I do hope we will not enter into that kind of era again”.

183,Napoleon's pistols sell for €1.69m at auction,"Two pistols owned by the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, with which he once intended to kill himself, have been sold at auction for €1.69m (£1.4m).  The weapons, which were created by the Paris gunmaker Louis-Marin Gosset, had been expected to fetch between €1.2m and €1.5m.  They were sold at the Osenat auction house on Sunday - next to the Fontainebleau palace where Napoleon tried to take his own life following his abdication in 1814. The pistols' sale comes after France's culture ministry recently classified them as national treasures and banned their export. This means the French government now has 30 months to make a purchase offer to the new owner, who has not been named. It also means the pistols can only leave France temporarily. The guns are inlaid with gold and silver, and feature an engraved image of Napoleon himself in profile.  He was said to have wanted to use them to kill himself on the night of 12 April, 1814 after the defeat of his army by foreign forces meant he had to give up power. However, his grand squire Armand de Caulaincourt removed the powder from the guns and Napoleon instead took poison but survived.  He later gave the pistols to Caulaincourt, who in turn passed them to his descendants.  Also included in the sale were the pistols' original box and various accessories including a powder horn and various powder tamping rods.  Auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat said that the ""image of Napoleon at his lowest point"" was being sold alongside the objects.  Napoleon memorabilia is highly sought after. One of the tricorne hats that became a part of his brand sold for €1.9m in November. The historic leader returned to power in 1815 following his exile to the Mediterranean island of Elba but went on to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo.  He died in 1821 after his second banishment - this time to the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.

Despite appearing to struggle with a stomach issue, Djokovic beat the 15th seed 6-3 6-4 6-2 on a rowdy Centre Court. Rune received the backing of many in attendance, who cheered him along with drawn-out bellowing of his name which Djokovic angrily took to be booing. ""They were [disrespecting me],"" Djokovic said. ""I don't accept it. I know they were cheering for Rune but that's an excuse to also boo. ""I've been on the tour for more than 20 years - trust me, I know all the tricks, I know how it works. You guys can't touch me."" The 37-year-old is going for an eighth Wimbledon title and record 25th Grand Slam overall. He will next play Alex de Minaur, who booked his spot in the quarter-finals with a 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-3 win against France's Arthur Fils. The real drama of the day in the men's singles came as American Taylor Fritz produced a magnificent escape act by battling from two sets down to beat fourth seed Alexander Zverev. 'An excuse to boo' - Djokovic irked by Wimbledon crowd 'Tough to play' - Svitolina's pain after attacks on Ukraine Hewett 'not far away' from Wimbledon singles glory Before Monday's final match on Centre Court, Djokovic said there would be ""fireworks"" when he faced Rune. The Dane had defeated Djokovic twice before - wins that helped establish him as one of the sport's rising stars. However, he rarely came close to troubling the second seed on this occasion, failing to make the most of just two break points. Still sporting a knee support on his right leg following surgery in June, Djokovic got off to a lightning start, winning the first 12 points and assuming a 3-0 advantage. Djokovic seemed to struggle with a stomach problem early in the second set, clutching his abdomen and taking deep breaths between points. However, he was still able to assert control for the remainder of the match and secured the straightforward victory in a little over two hours. This video can not be played 'Novak the great! - Djokovic seals straight-set victory over Rune Fritz, the 13th seed, gained a 4-6 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 victory over his German opponent Zverev on Centre Court prior to Djokovic's evening match. Zverev was aiming to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the first time and did not face a break point in the opening two sets. But Fritz, 26, became the first player to break the Zverev serve at this tournament during the third set, before edging the fourth to move the match into a decider. Zverev was wearing a support on his left knee after slipping in the late stages of his third-round win over Britain's Cameron Norrie, and as he faded a crucial break went the way of Fritz in the fourth game of the final set. For Fritz, a second appearance in the last eight at Wimbledon awaits him, two years after he lost to Rafael Nadal in a five-set thriller at that stage. It will be a fourth Grand Slam quarter-final in all for him, and he has yet to go further. Zverev had been only two games away from victory in the third set but has now fallen at the last-16 stage of Wimbledon on three occasions after experiencing the same fate in 2017 and 2021. ""It was amazing to do that on Centre Court, two sets down in front of this crowd. It's a dream,"" said a victorious Fritz, who gained only the third win of his career from being two sets behind. ""I still felt I was playing really well despite being down two sets. I was just thinking it sucked to be playing this well and to lose in straights. ""It's a second time in the quarter-finals, but this time I felt I earned it a lot more so I'm really excited for the chance.""

Italian 25th seed Musetti struggled against his big-serving French opponent in the first set before adapting his approach to win 4-6 6-3 6-3 6-2. Defeat ended an impressive run for Mpetshi Perricard, who was attempting to become the first lucky loser, man or woman, to reach the singles quarter-finals of a Grand Slam. An emotional Musetti said after his victory: ""It is a really phenomenal day for me."" Playing on his 21st birthday, Mpetshi Perricard entertained the court two crowd in the early stages with trick shots and huge serves. He lost in the final round of qualifying before being handed a reprieve after withdrawals from the main draw, and then made eye-catching progress - until Musetti had too much for him. The 22-year-old Musetti said: ""I've been dreaming of this moment since I was a kid. I always had a really beautiful family that always supported me."" The win continues an impressive grass-court swing for Musetti, who was a runner-up to Tommy Paul at Queen's Club last month.

191,Who will win Euros? Insiders from last four give their verdicts,"England, France, the Netherlands and Spain are vying to reach the final of Euro 2024 Four teams are preparing for the semi-finals of Euro 2024, with Spain set to face France on Tuesday while England take on the Netherlands the following day. Spain are seeking to win the tournament for the fourth time, having most recently triumphed in 2012. France last won it 24 years ago while the Dutch triumphed in 1988 - and England are of course hoping to end their wait for a first men's European Championship. So who is looking in the best shape for their semi-final, and who could win it all?  BBC Sport asked experts from each country for their views, and you can vote for who you think will lift the trophy at the end. Spain came through a tough game against Germany to reach the semi-finals Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague: Spain displayed three different ways against Germany. We played with wingers, then without wingers and no striker and then finally 4-2-4 in extra time, which means we have layers. The main thing is we adapted to anything Germany threw at us. Yes we could have lost, but we were never far away from winning it either. While we were superior to the previous four opponents but we were not against Germany. However we did not give up and got the victory, so it was a different test, one of resilience, faith in the idea, collaboration and insistence, and we came out of it well. It was also a very physical encounter; it was the most amount of fouls in a game in a European Championship since 2016, but we showed we are not now scared of that either. We showed a conservative streak when, while ahead, Fullkrug appeared on the scene, balls were crossed into the box and we dropped too deep. We had a team designed to keep the score; perhaps we can learn from that because being too intimidated and hiding in your own box is not, for us, a guarantee of success. Against France we know we will have to take the initiative, like we had to do against Italy, Albania and Georgia. We will have to be careful against counter-attacks, in the same way as we did against all our opponents. We are good at stopping them though, having committed the largest number of tactical fouls. I know for France to win they do not have to play well, so it will important to be focused the whole game as they keep looking for a moment of brilliance from their front men. We will have to be careful against France's pace, with the likes of Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe. Perhaps we are not as efficient as we should be up front, but because we press so often, and keep shooting and attacking and creating opportunities, eventually we tend to crack the nut and I feel that will happen against France again. We have suspensions, and Pedri was injured in the last game, but there is not a huge difference between our best player and our 'worst'. It is a team that behave at all times as that, as a collective, and with great flexibility, reading well what happens on the pitch. I think we will beat France and will meet England in the final. WINNER: Spain  'Magic moments and resilience can lead England to history' 'One of the world's best' - Saka's 'special' moment of redemption The 'leader', Gakpo's goals & a sea of orange - watch out England England came through a penalty shootout to beat Switzerland and reach the last four BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty: England must harness the resilience they have shown in the face of adversity and the individual brilliance from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka that has put them in the semi-final into a more cohesive team performance to beat the Netherlands. Gareth Southgate's side have struggled in Euro 2024 against sides who have defended deep, so the more attacking approach of the Netherlands might just suit them and give England’s creative players more room for manoeuvre. England will need to be at their best defensively because the Dutch pose a serious threat in attack, with Liverpool’s Cody Gakpo having a fine tournament and the unpredictable Memphis Depay always dangerous. If England get it right they can trouble a Netherlands defence that has looked vulnerable under pressure, with the potential battle between the respective captains Harry Kane and Virgil van Dijk a key component. Kane struggled desperately in England’s quarter-final against Switzerland, looking physically short and off the pace, but you would still not bet against him taking the big chance if one comes along. England are now, despite indifferent performances so far, in a position where they are serious contenders to win Euro 2024. They have reached the semi-finals almost in spite of themselves, but confidence must surely be growing and teams often get a sense of destiny being with them at this stage of major competitions – think Greece in 2004 and Portugal in 2016. If England were to win their first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup, this would not surprise me – but while a sixth sense says England, the head says Spain. Spain have looked the best team in what has been a mixed Euro 2024 although they could still come unstuck against a hugely talented but regimented France under Didier Deschamps. None of France's players have scored a goal from open play while Spain have been fluent with Lamine Yamal, who is not 17 until the day before the final, a revelation in a side that also boasts world-class talent in the shape of figures such as Manchester City’s Rodri. Spain have a potent mix of youth and experience, are growing into the competition and have looked the most impressive team from the start – but I believe they will have to get past England to win Euro 2024. WINNERS: Spain. Kylian Mbappe has scored one goal so far at Euro 2024 - a penalty against Poland in the group stage French football journalist Julien Laurens: We have seen the best of France defensively, certainly. This is what they do, it is their style and it is their DNA. It is also how you win tournaments, being solid defensively. Where they have perhaps not been at their best is with the ball. They do not play sexy football, it is not what they are about - but they have been lacking in terms of creating chances. They are usually more effective in the opposition's box.  Along with Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe has possibly been the biggest disappointment at this tournament. There are a few explanations, the first being the mask he has had to wear after breaking his nose against Austria. In that game he had looked quite sharp. He also had a few fitness issues before the Euros, so I do not think he is fully fit - but the mask is also really bothering him. If there is one team that can frustrate Spain more than any other here, it is France. For me, with Spain's problems in midfield as a result of Pedri's injury it will be a case of who wins the battle in the middle. The physical impact the France midfield has is incredible and that is where the game will be won. This will be a big game for Antoine Griezmann considering he has spent more of his career in Spain than in France, so we need him and Mbappe to raise their games. I want a France-England final and I think France, of the four semi-finalists, have the ruthlessness and the experience of this level. I also think at some point Kylian will become Kylian again and will be unbeatable. WINNERS: France  Wout Weghorst has been a useful weapon off the bench for the Netherlands Dutch SoccerNews.nl football writer Jesper Langbroek: The Turkey game I think showed the Netherlands have a good Plan B - using Wout Weghorst as a striker with Memphis Depay just behind. England played with five defenders against Switzerland, so it made it very compact in that area. I think this is the way we need to play if we are going to do it. The thing I have noticed with this team is they need a wake-up call to get going. They had that against Austria and then against Romania they were good. Then they had another wake-up call when Turkey took the lead in the quarter-final. There is more in both these teams but they are not coming out yet - and that is a similarity between the sides. I think the winner will come from the other side of the draw. England and the Netherlands have not yet been tested really; they have faced some good teams but not played the big countries as they are on the other side of the draw. I think Spain will win because they are playing good football as a collective. England, France and the Netherlands are still waiting to get everything together, but time is running out.

192,Bellamy set to be named Wales manager,"Craig Bellamy is expected to leave Championship Burnley to succeed former Wales team-mate Rob Page Craig Bellamy is set to be named the new Wales manager. The 44-year-old has emerged as the Football Association of Wales (FAW's) first choice to replace Rob Page, who was sacked last month. Bellamy is currently at Burnley, where he had been acting head coach before Scott Parker’s appointment last week. Parker was keen to work with the Welshman, but it appears the former Wales captain is attracted to managing his country. BBC Sport Wales understands the final details of a deal are still be agreed with both Bellamy and Burnley.  But an appointment is understood to be close, bringing an end the search to replace Page who was sacked in June after Wales failed to qualify for Euro 2024. Bellamy has long stated his ambition to manage his country and met with senior FAW figures last week. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, Georgia boss Willy Sagnol and surprise contender Oxford United boss Des Buckingham were all spoken to about the post. But Bellamy, who narrowly missed out to Ryan Giggs for job in 2018, is said to have impressed during discussions – and will now get the chance to lead the side in qualification for the 2026 World Cup. His first game as Wales manager will be a Nations League home tie against Turkey on 6 September, followed by a trip to Montenegro on 9 September. Bellamy scored 19 times for Wales, including the winner against Italy in 2002. Bellamy made 78 appearances for Wales before retiring from international football in 2013, missing out on the chance to play in a major finals when Wales qualified under Chris Coleman two years later. He took his first steps in coaching with Cardiff City’s academy before serving as assistant manager to former Manchester City team-mate Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht and then Burnley. Bellamy stood in when Kompany served a touchline ban last season and stepped up when the Belgian left for Bayern Munich in May. But with Burnley opting for former Fulham and Bournemouth manager Parker for the permanent role, it opened the door for the FAW. Bellamy now appears ready to return to Wales having ended his playing career with hometown club Cardiff City, helping them to promotion to the Premier League in 2014. The inside story of Page's rise and fall as Wales boss FAW sets out criteria to succeed Page as Wales boss FAW suspends president Williams pending investigation Having started his playing career at Norwich, Bellamy's playing career spanned many of the biggest clubs in British football, including Newcastle, Celtic, Manchester City and Liverpool, twice. But even as a player he was keen to broaden his outlook beyond the domestic game and when coming through the professional ranks as a player, would regularly go to watch football on the continent. While accruing plenty of international experience with Wales, Bellamy, who netted 19 goals for his country, was part of the Great Britain team at the 2012 Olympics. Bellamy is seventh in both the all time list of Wales international goal scorers and cap holders, and was one vote shy from beating Giggs to succeed Coleman for the the national job. He had previously helped coach Wales age-grade sides but, having turned down the chance to take his first steps into frontline management with Oxford in 2018, Bellamy’s breakthrough will now come at the highest level.",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cek929j2xp1o,Rob Phillips,2024-07-08 21:09:49,
193,Sunak names new top team as Lord Cameron resigns,"Rishi Sunak has confirmed his interim shadow cabinet, after 12 members of his top team lost their seats in the general election.  Ex-Prime Minister Lord Cameron, who had made a surprise return to cabinet in November, has resigned and been replaced by his former deputy Andrew Mitchell as shadow foreign secretary.  Richard Holden has also resigned as party chairman, after what he described as a ""very tough set of results"", and is replaced by former Economic Secretary to the Treasury Richard Fuller as interim chairman. Many of the key briefs remain unchanged, with Jeremy Hunt named as shadow chancellor and James Cleverly as shadow home secretary, mirroring the portfolios they held in government.  However, James Cartlidge has been appointed shadow defence secretary and Ed Argar shadow justice secretary, after Grant Shapps and Alex Chalk lost their seats. The Conservatives now have only 121 MPs - the lowest number in the party's history - after losing 251 seats in a Labour landslide. Writing on social media, Lord Cameron said: ""It’s been a huge honour to serve as foreign secretary, but clearly the Conservative Party in opposition will need to shadow the new foreign secretary from the Commons."" He added: ""As a committed Conservative I will continue to support the party and help where I can as we rebuild from the very disappointing election result."" As a peer, Lord Cameron did not face his opposite number in the Commons.  In other changes:  Among those who will continue to shadow their former posts are Oliver Dowden, as deputy leader of the opposition, Victoria Atkins as shadow health secretary and Claire Coutinho as shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero. Interim party chairman Richard Fuller said: ""The Conservative Party has had a difficult election and it is important that we regroup and reflect on these results. “We should also challenge ourselves candidly and deeply on the strengths of the Conservative Party across the country and outline where improvements can be made."" In his resignation letter Mr Holden, who held the previously safe Conservative seat of Basildon and Billericay by just 20 votes, said it had been ""the greatest honour of my life"" to be party chairman.  He said there needed to be a ""thorough review"" of the election campaign, adding: ""While I will obviously feed into that, this would best take place with a new set of eyes to help provide the clearest view."" Mr Sunak has said he will stay on as party leader until arrangements for selecting his successor are in place. The timetable for this remains unclear and no Tories have confirmed they will run to replace him yet. Among the figures tipped to stand are former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, shadow health secretary Ms Atkins and new shadow levelling up secretary Ms Badenoch.  The other positions confirmed are: ",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgm3g37klko,"Becky Morton,",2024-07-08 20:09:49,
194,Pace bowler Atkinson to make England Test debut,"Gus Atkinson was part of the England squad for the tour of India earlier this year Pace bowler Gus Atkinson will make his Test debut in England's series opener against West Indies at Lord's on Wednesday. The 26-year-old joins Chris Woakes and the retiring James Anderson as the specialist seamers. Atkinson's Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith, 23, will also make his Test bow behind the stumps, a move confirmed when he was named in the squad ahead of Jonny Bairstow and Ben Foakes. Atkinson, who has played nine one-day internationals and three T20s, was part of the England squad for the Test tour of India earlier this year, but did not feature. Smith usually plays for Surrey as a specialist batter with Foakes taking the gloves, although he was England's keeper for the two one-day internationals he played against Ireland last year. Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, picked in the England squad ahead of his Somerset team-mate Jack Leach, plays his first home Test after winning three caps on the tour of India. England XI: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, James Anderson. I'm still bowling as well as ever, says Anderson Higher or lower? Take our quiz on Anderson's Test wickets Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words Overall, England have a fresh look for the first Test in the three-match series against the Windies. There are four changes from the side heavily beaten in the final Test of the 4-1 series defeat in India and four from the last home Test against Australia at The Oval last July. Leach, Foakes and Bairstow have been left out, while 41-year-old Anderson has been told this will be the last international match of a record-breaking career that has seen him become England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker. Atkinson, capable of bowling at high pace, has taken 59 wickets in 19 first-class matches. He gets the nod ahead of Matthew Potts and the uncapped Dillon Pennington, who are the other seamers in the squad. Smith has long been touted as a future England prospect. An attractive stroke-maker, he averages more than 40 in first-class cricket and in excess of 56 in the County Championship this season. Along with the debutants, batter Harry Brook returns at number five after missing the tour of India to be with his ill grandmother, who passed away in March. This video can not be played James Anderson: 'I've got to deal with and accept' England retirement Woakes also plays his first Test since last summer after being overlooked for the tour of India despite being named player of the series in the Ashes. Perhaps most importantly for England, captain Ben Stokes looks set to be able to play a full part as a bowler after being plagued by a long-term left-knee injury. The all-rounder had surgery in November and tentatively returned to bowling in India before accelerating his rehab in three County Championship matches for Durham. Stokes bowled a substantial spell in the nets at Lord's on Monday, with England able to practice outside despite the mixed weather in London.

195,US name Bradley as 2025 Ryder Cup captain,"Keegan Bradley has won one major and six PGA Tour events since turning professional in 2008 Keegan Bradley will captain the United States in the 2025 Ryder Cup against Europe.  The 38-year-old was not the first choice for the role, but 15-time major champion Tiger Woods turned it down. ""My passion and appreciation for golf's greatest team event have never been stronger,"" said Bradley, who was on the losing side in his two appearances as a player - in 2012 and 2014. ""The Ryder Cup is unlike any other competition in our sport. And this edition will undoubtedly be particularly special given the rich history and enthusiastic spectators at this iconic course.  ""I look forward to beginning preparations."" The 45th edition of the biennial contest will take place at the Bethpage Black course in New York from 25-28 September. Woods had been a long-time favourite to succeed Zach Johnson and lead the US side as they look to bounce back from a 16½-11½ defeat in Rome last September. But the former world number one, who played on eight Ryder Cup teams, repeatedly delayed his decision. He said at the US PGA Championship in May that he did not want to ""fulfill the role of the captaincy if I can't do it"", citing his position on the PGA Tour policy board as something that was taking up a lot of his time. And given the announcement of Bradley as captain, it would appear Woods finally decided he could not dedicate the time to the role that he would want to. Bradley, who won his solitary major at the 2011 US PGA Championship, was on the losing Ryder Cup teams in 2012 - as Europe won the 'Miracle of Medinah' - and two years later at Gleneagles in Scotland. PGA of America president John Lindert, who made the announcement, said: ""Keegan's past Ryder Cup experience, strong relationships and unwavering passion for this event will prove invaluable as he guides the US team over the next year and a half. ""We are confident that with Keegan at the helm, the 2025 US Ryder Cup Team will compete at Bethpage with the same confidence and determination that has defined his career."" It would appear to be a change in direction for the PGA of America, who run the US Ryder Cup team. Recent captains Johnson, Jim Furyk and Davis Love III all served as an assistant captain at least once before taking on the top job. Bradley, who has won five PGA Tour events, to add to his major, since turning professional in 2008, has not been near the side since 2014. In his two Ryder Cup appearances, he won four and lost three matches - one of the defeats being in a singles match against Rory McIlroy in 2012 when the Northern Irishman almost missed his tee-time. Despite winning twice on the PGA Tour last year, Bradley missed out on one of the six automatic qualifying places on the US team. He finished 11th overall but was then overlooked when captain Johnson selected six wildcard picks for Rome, with Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler selected despite being lower down the rankings. Bradley was being filmed at home for the Netflix documentary Full Swing when Johnson phoned to tell him he would not make the team.  His disappointment was obvious, as he said: ""I’m thinking about the Ryder Cup every second of every day.” In an earlier interview with Sports Illustrated, Bradley said he knew there was ""a big risk"" he would not be selected. Thomas, who was 15th on the qualifying list, had previously had a successful pairing with his good friend Jordan Spieth, who was eighth on the list and also selected by Johnson, who was criticised after the defeat for fostering a ""boys"" club. ""The thing is, those guys are close. They’re not just PGA Tour-close, they’re close friends,” Bradley said.  “If you take golf out of the equation, they’re legit close friends. You have your close friends as a golfer and then you have your close PGA Tour friends, and a lot of the time your close friends aren’t on the Tour.” Former Ryder Cup player: Check. Major winner: Check. Keegan Bradley ticks the two qualifying criteria the USA usually demands of its Ryder Cup captains. But the appointment of the 2011 US PGA champion still comes from way out of left field. And some. Bradley has always been regarded as an outsider. An idiosyncratic character, not deemed sufficiently a team player to earn a captain’s wildcard for the last Ryder Cup despite his persuasive form.  It was an omission more down to personality than play. Now he is regarded as the man to galvanise the Americans to win back the trophy lost so comprehensively at Marco Simone last year. Astonishing. His two appearances for the US were on losing teams despite his own impassioned performances.  Bradley will be 39 by the time of the contest, the youngest US captain since a 34-year-old Arnold Palmer was a playing captain in 1963, but he hardly carries the same stature. Bethpage next year will be a place for cool heads amid an expected bear pit atmosphere. But Bradley has a combustible streak as we witnessed in a bust up with Miguel Angel Jimenez at the WGC Matchplay a few years ago.  “He’ll start a riot,” one observer claimed in the wake of this appointment. That is probably stretching it, but for the US to go with someone who does not even posses experience as a vice-captain is an extraordinary gamble. Bradley did win respect for the dignified way he accepted his non selection for the last match. But no one would have predicted it would pave the way for him to take charge of the US quest to win back the Ryder Cup.",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c134x427myko,Peter Scrivener,2024-07-08 21:09:49,
196,Shaw 'fit and ready' to play 90 minutes for England,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Luke Shaw 'fit and ready to go' for England England defender Luke Shaw says he is fit and ready to play 90 minutes at Euro 2024. Shaw, the only specialist left-back in Gareth Southgate’s squad, did not play in England’s first four matches of the Euros because of a hamstring injury. But the Manchester United player came on as a second-half substitute during the quarter-final victory over Switzerland - and says he is now ready to play a bigger part in England’s campaign. ""Of course, I think I am [fit and ready to play 90 minutes],” Shaw said. “That is down to Gareth's decision. I feel fit and ready to go."" Shaw’s appearance from the bench after 78 minutes against Switzerland marked his first competitive football since suffering his injury in February. Southgate had hoped to have Shaw back during the group stage in Germany, but his recovery took longer than expected and has meant Kieran Trippier deputising on the left side of defence. ""The last four months have been really tough,” Shaw said of his injury problems. “At the start I was expected to come back a lot sooner, but I went through a lot of setbacks. “It was really nice to get on the other night and get some minutes - I've been itching. ""I think before the squad got announced, we had a plan to come back around the second or third game but, unfortunately, things didn't go as planned and I was pushed back a game or so. ""Of course, it's tough. They were really there for me, not just Gareth and Steve [Holland, England assistant manager] but the medical staff as well. I have a lot to thank them for."" Euro 2024 highlights Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Shaw has 32 caps for England, 26 of them earned under Gareth Southgate Shaw has had to sit and watch from the sidelines as England reached the semi-finals of a second successive European Championship. The 28-year-old has been focusing on his recovery, to the extent that he pulled out of a scheduled media conference before the Switzerland game as he did not want to speak to the press before he had got back on the field of play. ""It's been strange,” he said of his Euro 2024 experience. “It's also been difficult as well, going to games, feeling the atmosphere. Not putting the shirt on or being involved in games was hard, but that motivated me more to work back. ""The atmosphere in those games spurred me on. ""I was of course excited to come back, but the priority was to help us get back into the game and get us through."" Without Shaw, England have not always impressed at Euro 2024 – drawing their final two group matches before going behind in both knockout games so far. But brilliant equalisers by Jude Bellingham against Slovakia and Bukayo Saka versus Switzerland have helped them through. Born in the Football League - England's EFL journey Who will win Euros? Insiders from last four give their verdicts Zwayer to referee Netherlands v England Shaw was the only specialist left-back picked by Southgate for the England squad at Euro 2024 Shaw knows what it is like to score a big goal in a European Championship – he opened the scoring for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy inside three minutes with a powerful volley. But watching from the bench, he says he has been put through the wringer just as much as the England fans. ""I felt more nervous watching than playing - it is quite tough,” he said. ""I never once thought that we were going to go out. We have to believe right to the end. ""Good moments like Jude's [equaliser] can happen, but it's down to us to deliver that on the pitch. ""Game by game we are getting better - there's things we can still improve on but we're looking good."" Shaw has become a key player under Southgate, starting every match at the 2022 World Cup, and defended his manager over the criticism he has received for his selections and style of play. ""I don't understand the criticism,” Shaw said of Southgate, who has become the first man to lead England to three major tournament semi-finals. “What he's done for the country and us players, he's taken us to the next level. No manager has been as successful as he has recently. ""Us players love him - he's exactly what we need. He allows us to go out on the pitch and be our best. He's shown a lot of faith and trust in picking me.""",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c728j0vg54lo,Unknown,2024-07-08 16:09:49,
207,US officials uncover alleged Russian ‘bot farm’,"US officials say they have taken action against an AI-powered information operation run from Russia, including nearly 1,000 accounts pretending to be Americans. The accounts on X were designed to spread pro-Russia stories but were automated “bots” - not real people. In court documents made public Tuesday the US justice department said the operation was devised by a deputy editor at Kremlin-owned RT, formerly Russia Today. RT runs TV channels in English and several other languages, but appears much more popular on social media than on conventional airwaves. The justice department seized two websites that were used to issue emails associated with the bot accounts, and ordered X to turn over information relating to 968 accounts that investigators say were bots. According to the court documents, artificial intelligence was used to create the accounts, which then spread pro-Russian story lines, particularly about the war in Ukraine.   “Today’s actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Russia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government,” Mr Wray said in a statement. The accounts now appear to have been deleted by X, and screenshots shared by FBI investigators indicated that they had very few followers.  The court documents detailed how the so-called “bot farm” was the brainchild of an RT deputy editor-in-chief who was looking for new ways to distribute stories. RT America was shut down when several major US cable TV providers dropped it shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Another RT employee developed the network, the court documents said, and later a Russian intelligence officer joined the effort, which the justice department described as an attempt “to sow discord in the United States by spreading misinformation”. No criminal charges have been made public in the case, but the justice department noted that its investigation is ongoing. Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation, said it was not surprising that a Russia-linked operation was relying on AI to create fake accounts. “This used to be one of the more time consuming parts of their work; now it has been made much smoother by the technologies that abetted this operation,” she said, noting that the operation appears to have been thwarted before it gained traction. “Artificial intelligence is now clearly part of the disinformation arsenal,” Ms Jankowicz said. The BBC contacted X, RT and the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment. A recent BBC investigation uncovered details of a separate attempt to bolster a Russia-based disinformation network, through the use of fake news sites populated by stories rewritten by AI.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng24pxkelo,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-09 21:11:34,
206,Canada faces pressure at Nato summit for riding on 'coattails',"Canada is under mounting pressure to increase its military spending as it continues to fall short of the target set out for Nato members, raising fears that the country is becoming an outlier among its allies. That message is expected to be made clear this week as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends the Nato summit in Washington DC to mark the military alliance’s 75th anniversary. Canada, a Nato-founding member, ranks seventh overall in the amount of money spent on defence among the 32-nation alliance. But it falls way short of the alliance’s doctrine, which requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military. Using that metric, Canada - which spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military - is  ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the alliance. By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%. Canada’s defence budget currently stands at C$27bn ($19.8bn, £15.5bn), though the Trudeau government has promised in its most recent budget that it will boost spending to almost C$50bn by 2030. Still, that would only make up 1.76% of Canada’s GDP, meaning the country will continue to lag behind its allies in the coming decade. Frustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators. “We are concerned and profoundly disappointed that Canada’s most recent projection indicated that it will not reach its two percent commitment this decade,” the senators wrote. The US ambassador to Canada David Cohen has also taken note, saying in a recent interview with Global News that Canada is now “the outlier in the entire alliance”. In less diplomatic remarks, US House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Monday that it is “shameful” Canada has not hit the 2% mark. “Talk about riding America’s coattails,” he said. In response, Canada’s defence minister, Bill Blair, said at the Foreign Policy Security Forum on Monday that the country will soon share a “credible, verifiable plan” to boost its military spending. “I’m very confident that it’s going to bring us to that threshold,” Mr Blair said. Meanwhile, Canada’s ambassador in Washington, Kristen Hillman, told reporters that while the pressure is on to step up, there is also “a strong recognition that Canada is a steadfast ally in all aspects”. The alliance finds itself at a critical moment.  Member nations are dealing with a more aggressive Russia that is continuing to wage a war in Ukraine. There is also the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, who successfully pushed European Nato members to boost spending when he was US president. Mr Trump has continued to speak on Nato spending on the campaign trail, once floating the idea of letting Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to alliance members who failed to meet targets.  If Canada does not meet its spending commitments, it could open itself up to pressure from Mr Trump if he wins November's presidential election.  European allies may also grow resentful, said Christopher Sands, head of the Washington DC-based Wilson Center’s Canada Institute. Canada is already feeling the consequences in other ways, he said.  It has ambitions to be part of  US-led Indo-Pacific economic talks, which includes countries like Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea.  But so far, Canada has been left out.  It has also been excluded from the AUKUS defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US. “That’s where the real rubber hits the road for Canada. Nobody invites you to the conversation because - without wanting to embarrass you - they know you don’t have what it takes to be a serious player,” Mr Sands said. Philippe Legassé, a Carleton University professor whose research focuses on defence policy and procurement, said there are a number of reasons why Canada lags behind in spending despite being a relatively financially strong country. First, the Canadian public does not see defence spending as a priority when measured against other needs, like healthcare and other social services. “Both major parties in Canada recognise that it is in their political interest to spend at a certain level that shows you are taking care of the armed forces, but not necessarily at a level where it begins to impact your other priorities,” Prof Legassé said. Another reason is that, historically, Canada did not focus on its military spending as much because it was protected by nuclear allies like the UK and the US.  It saw its value in other collective security endeavours, including peacekeeping.  At the onset of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, deficits in Canada’s military capabilities became clear and launched a wave of spending, said Mr Sands. But Canada is still playing catch up after decades of neglect and struggles when it comes to critical issues like procurement. Aside from the pointed remarks by Speaker Johnson, experts anticipate much of the pressure on Canada at the Nato summit will be made behind closed doors, rather than direct criticism aimed at Mr Trudeau. “It’s a little delicate because Canada is doing quite a bit in terms of tangible contributions,” Prof Legassé said. That includes support for Ukraine and work leading the multinational Nato battlegroup in Latvia. He added that US President Joe Biden and a number of other Nato leaders are ideologically aligned with Mr Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, and would prefer not to pressure him publicly.  “They don’t necessarily want to give fuel to the idea amongst Canadian conservatives and the general public that the Trudeau government is failing miserably,” he said.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4ygzlz4mzo,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-09 19:11:34,
205,Russian court orders arrest of Yulia Navalnaya,"A court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on charges of extremism, according to state media. The charges brought against Yulia Navalnaya, who lives outside Russia, in absentia are to do with her alleged ""participation in an extremist society"", Tass news agency said.  Navalny was Russia's most significant opposition leader of the past decade. He died in February in an Arctic Circle jail. Russian authorities said he died of natural causes - but his widow said Navalny had been ""tortured, starved, cut off and killed"" by Russia's president Vladimir Putin.  Navalny had been serving 19 years on extremism charges that were widely seen as politically motivated. Responding to the arrest warrant against her, Yulia Navalnaya posted on X: ""When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal. ""His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cosy cell with a TV, but in Russia - in the same colony and the same two-by-three-metre cell in which he killed Alexei."" The Moscow court ruled that Ms Navalnaya, who has vowed to continue the work of her husband, should be remanded in custody and she was declared wanted.   The decision means she would face arrest if she set foot in Russia.  The charges may be linked to a Moscow court ruling in June 2021 which outlawed three organisations linked to Navalny, labelling them ""extremists"".  Ms Navalnaya was unable to attend his funeral in March.  She has since met a number of Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden.  This month, she was elected to chair the US-based Human Rights Foundation - a non-profit organisation working to promote and protect human rights across the world.  She said she would use her role to step up the struggle her husband fought against Mr Putin.

204,How Canada became a car theft capital of the world,"Logan LaFreniere woke up one October morning in 2022 to an empty driveway. His brand new Ram Rebel truck was missing.  His security camera captured two hooded men breaking into the pickup in the dead of night outside of his Milton, Ontario home, and driving it away with ease. A few months later, that very same truck appeared on a website of vehicles for sale in Ghana, an ocean and some 8,500km away. “The dead giveaway was the laptop holder that we had installed in the back of the driver’s seat for my son, and in it was garbage that he had put in there,” Mr LaFreniere told the BBC. That same clutter was visible in photos of the car listing, he said. “There was no doubt in my mind that it was my vehicle.” Mr LaFreniere’s story is hardly unique. In 2022, more than 105,000 cars were stolen in Canada - about one car every five minutes. Among the victims was Canada’s very own federal justice minister, whose government-issued Toyota Highlander XLE was taken twice by thieves. Early this summer, Interpol listed Canada among the top 10 worst countries for car thefts out of 137 in its database - a “remarkable” feat, said a spokesperson, considering the country only began integrating their data with the international police organisation in February. Authorities say once these cars are stolen, they are either used to carry out other violent crimes, sold domestically to other unsuspecting Canadians, or shipped overseas to be resold. Interpol says it has detected more than 1,500 cars around the world that have been stolen from Canada since February, and around 200 more continue to be identified each week, usually at ports in other countries. Car theft is such an epidemic that it was declared a “national crisis” by the Insurance Bureau of Canada, which says insurers have had to pay out more than C$1.5bn ($1bn; £860m) in vehicle theft claims last year. The problem has forced police jurisdictions across the country to issue public bulletins on how to protect vehicles from theft. Meanwhile, some Canadians have taken matters into their own hands, doing everything from installing trackers on their cars to hiring private neighbourhood security. Some who can afford it have even installed retractable bollards in their driveways - similar to those seen at banks and embassies - to try and deter thieves. Nauman Khan, who lives in Mississauga, a city just outside Toronto, started a bollard-installation business after he and his brother were both victims of car thefts. In one attempt, Mr Khan said the thieves broke into his home while his wife and young children were sleeping. They were looking for the keys to his Mercedes GLE parked out front, he said, but ran after he confronted them. After that “traumatic” experience, they sold their cars except for two “humble” family vehicles. Through his business, Mr Khan said he now hears similar stories from people throughout the region of Toronto. “It’s been very busy,” he said. “We had one client whose street had so many home invasions that he’d hired a security guard every night outside his house because he just didn’t feel safe.” The pervasiveness of car thefts in Canada is surprising given how small the country’s population is compared to the US and the UK - other countries with high rates of such crime, says Alexis Piquero, Director of the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. “[Canada] also doesn’t have as many port cities as the US does,” said Mr Piquero. While the US, Canada and the UK have all experienced a spike in car thefts since the Covid-19 pandemic, Canada’s rate of thefts (262.5 per 100,000 people) is higher than that of England and Wales (220 per 100,000 people), according to the latest available data from each country. It is also fairly close to that of the US, which sits at around 300 vehicle thefts per 100,000 people, based on 2022 data. The rise in recent years is partly due to a pandemic-driven global car shortage that has increased demand for both used and new vehicles.  There is also a growing market for certain car models internationally, making auto theft a top revenue generator for organised crime groups, said Elliott Silverstein, director of government relations at the Canadian Automobile Association. But Mr Silverstein said the way that Canada’s ports operate make them more vulnerable to this type of theft than other countries. “In the port system, there’s a greater focus on what is coming into the country than what is exiting the country,” he said, adding that once the vehicles are packed up in shipping containers at a port it becomes harder to get to them.   Police have managed to recover some stolen cars.  In October, the Toronto Police Service announced an 11-month investigation that recovered 1,080 vehicles worth around C$60m. More than 550 charges were laid as a result.   And between mid-December and the end of March, border and police officers found nearly 600 stolen vehicles at the Port of Montreal after inspecting 400 shipping containers. These types of operations, however, can be difficult to carry out given the volume of merchandise that moves through that port, experts have said. Around 1.7 million containers moved through the Port of Montreal in 2023 alone. Port staff also do not have the authority to inspect containers in most cases, and in customs-controlled areas only border officers can open a container without a warrant. At the same time, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has been grappling with chronic understaffing, according to a report submitted by its union to the government in April. Outdated technology is also an issue.  Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton - another Ontario city hard-hit by car thefts - recently paid a visit to the Port Newark Container Terminal in New Jersey to compare inspection tactics between the US and Canada. He told the National Post newspaper that US authorities have “got scanners. They measure density. They work closely with local law enforcement”. “These are things that we don’t do in Canada,” he said. In May, the Canadian government said it would invest millions to bolster the CBSA’s ability to search shipping containers. Police will also get additional money to combat auto theft in their communities. But Mr Silverstein said he believes a missing puzzle piece is auto manufacturers themselves. “Everyone is talking about trying to recover vehicles, and a lot of my focus has been on why we are not making the vehicles tougher to steal in the first place,” he said. In the meantime, car owners like Mr LaFreniere are still grappling with what to do to keep their vehicles safe. After his Ram Rebel truck was stolen, he replaced it with a Toyota Tundra - a vehicle that Mr LaFreniere described as his “dream truck”. This time, he installed an engine immobiliser on it to prevent thieves from being able to easily start the car. He also equipped it with a tag tracker in case it did get stolen, and added a club on the steering wheel for good measure. Thieves were undeterred. A pair came to Mr LaFreniere’s driveway, this time to steal the Tundra. They had a harder time, however, and resorted to shattering the back window to get inside. The commotion woke Mr LaFreniere and he called 911. But the thieves managed to run away in the four minutes it took for police to arrive. He paid to repair his brand new truck and then sold it. The whole ordeal, he said, was nothing short of “disheartening”.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy79dq2n093o,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-09 00:11:34,
203,Europe's Ariane-6 rocket blasts off in maiden flight,"Europe's big new rocket, Ariane-6, has blasted off successfully on its maiden flight. The vehicle set off from a launchpad in French Guiana about 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on a demonstration mission to put a clutch of satellites in orbit. Crews on the ground in Kourou applauded as the rocket soared into the sky.  Developed at a cost of €4bn (£3.4bn), Ariane-6 is intended to be a workhorse rocket that gives European governments and companies access to space independently from the rest of the world. It already has a backlog of launch contracts, but there are worries its design could limit future prospects. Like its predecessor, Ariane-5, the new model is expendable - a new rocket is needed for every mission, whereas the latest American vehicles are being built to be wholly or partially reusable. Nonetheless, European space officials believe Ariane-6 can carve out a niche for itself. ""This is a big moment,"" said European Space Agency (Esa) director-general Josef Aschbacher. ""Daily life today really depends on information from satellites, from telecommunications and Earth observation to weather forecasting and disaster management. It is unimaginable for Europe not to have guaranteed, independent access to space,"" he told BBC News. On the surface, the 6 looks very similar to the old 5, but under the skin it harnesses state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques (3D printing, friction stir welding, augmented reality design, etc) that should result in faster and cheaper production. Ariane-6 will operate in two configurations: The core stage is supplemented with a second, or upper, stage that will place the payloads in their precise orbits high above the Earth. This stage can be stopped and restarted multiple times, which is useful when launching large batches of satellites into a constellation, or network. The reignition capability also enables the stage to pull itself back down to Earth, so it won't become a piece of lingering space junk. Tuesday's mission used the Ariane-62 variant. The rocket will ascend to an altitude of 580km before starting to offload free-flying payloads. These are a mix of university and commercial spacecraft. They include two capsules that will endeavour to survive a fiery fall through the atmosphere to splash down in the Pacific. One of the capsules, which goes by the name of Nyx Bikini, is a small-scale demonstrator from a Franco-German company which aims eventually to develop spacecraft that can transport supplies and people to and from space stations in Earth orbit. Inaugural flights are always occasions of high jeopardy. It's not uncommon for a new rocket design to have a failure. Ariane-5 famously blew itself apart 37 seconds after leaving the ground on its debut in 1996. The loss was put down to an error in control software. But a revised rocket then came back to dominate the commercial launch market for the world's biggest satellites. That dominance was only broken in the 2010s by US entrepreneur Elon Musk and his reusable Falcon-9 rockets. Falcon flight rates and prices undercut the competitiveness of Ariane-5. Europe is moving towards reusability, but the necessary technologies will not be in service until the 2030s. And in the meantime, Mr Musk is introducing even bigger rockets that promise to reduce launch costs still further. Ariane-6 enters a very challenging environment, therefore. ""We can all have our own opinions. What I can just reaffirm is that we have an order book that is full,"" said Lucia Linares, who heads space transportation strategy at Esa. ""I guess the word goes here to the customers: they have said Ariane-6 is an answer to their needs."" There are launch contracts to take the rocket through its first three years of operations. These include 18 launches for another US billionaire, Jeff Bezos, who wants to establish a constellation of internet satellites he calls Kuiper. European officials aim to have Ariane-6 flying roughly once a month. If this flight rate can be achieved, then the rocket should be able to establish itself, commented Pierre Lionnet from space consultancy ASD Eurospace. ""First, we need to ensure that there is sufficient demand from European customers - the European institutional ones. Then Ariane needs to win just a few commercial customers beyond Kuiper. This would give it a market,"" he told BBC News. ""But it's a matter of pricing. If Falcon-9 is systematically undercutting the price offer  of Ariane-6, there will be an issue."" Ariane-6 is a project of 13 member states of Esa, led by France (56%) and Germany (21%). The 13 partners have promised subsidy payments of up to €340m (£295m) a year to support the early phase of Ariane-6 exploitation. The UK was a leading player right at the beginning of Europe's launcher programme and remains an Esa member state, but its direct involvement in Ariane ended when the Ariane-4 model was retired, in 2003. A few UK companies continue to supply components on a commercial basis, and some spacecraft built in Britain will undoubtedly continue to fly on Ariane.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19km33k1mpo,"Jonathan Amos,",2024-07-09 20:11:34,
199,US blocks British court from British territory,"The US government has blocked a British court hearing from taking place on a British territory, citing security concerns, according to official documents. The supreme court of British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) was due to hold a hearing this week, attended by the BBC, on whether a group of migrants was being unlawfully detained on the island of Diego Garcia. The island hosts a secretive UK-US military base and access is heavily restricted. The US last week said it was “withdrawing its consent” for lawyers representing the migrants and “members of the press” - the BBC - to access the island, according to official communications we have seen. It said it would not allow participants of the hearing to board US military flights to Diego Garcia and would not provide “housing, transportation, and food for the visit”. The US said it would be “willing to reconsider” if the visit was “conducted in a manner” that addressed its “security and operational concerns”. Dozens of migrants arrived on the island in October 2021, saying they had been fleeing persecution and trying to sail to Canada to claim asylum when their boat ran into trouble near Diego Garcia. Late last Thursday night - hours before the judge, UK government lawyers and those representing the migrants, and the BBC were due to board flights for the first leg of the journey - the court shared an order cancelling the hearing. The US security concerns relate to a site visit that had been scheduled to take place on the island as part of the hearing, which was to include the migrant camp and several other areas of Diego Garcia. In a communication on 3 July, entitled “United States Notification to the United Kingdom of denial of the 6-12 July 2024 visit by of [sic] the Biot Supreme Court to Diego Garcia”, US authorities said the site visit presented “risks to the security and effective operation” of the base.  It had previously said it was willing to allow access to areas including the migrant camp, beaches around it and a chapel where children receive schooling.  But it had said it would not provide access to areas “open to civilian contractors and other non-military personnel”, such as a movie theatre, a barber and a bowling centre, the airport terminal and “all US-controlled areas occupied by the Biot administration, the Royal Overseas Police, and the Royal Navy”. Court documents filed on behalf of Biot’s commissioner state that the reasons for the island's US military commander's decision were “confidential and based on the US’s assessment of its own national security needs”. Tom Short, a lawyer from the UK firm Leigh Day which is representing some of the migrants, said the cancellation of this week’s hearing had been “a devastating blow to our vulnerable clients”, and called for it to be rearranged as soon as possible. “Our clients have ceded to US demands that the site visit exclude certain US-controlled buildings (such as the gym and swimming pool where US cheerleaders and celebrity chefs visited earlier this year) as well as facilities such as the Turner Club and Golf Club (which Biot and FCDO civil servants frequent).  “It is of paramount importance to our clients that the Judge see the detention camp and that they attend a hearing in person,” he added. A virtual court hearing on Tuesday, attended by lawyers in London and the migrants in Diego Garcia, sought to determine the next steps in the case as discussions between the UK and US governments continue. Speaking after the hearing, migrants told the BBC of their disappointment at this week’s hearing being cancelled. “It has taken away all our hope,” one woman said. “We have been stuck in this place for almost three years. We were hoping that this hearing would provide us some relief.” The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965. It went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the military base. Agreements signed in 1966 allowed for an initial 50-year period of US use of the territory, plus a further 20 years. The agreement was then “rolled over” in 2016, and is now set to expire in 2036, according to the Biot website. Biot is administered from London but is described as being ""constitutionally distinct” from the UK. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains that the islands are its own and the United Nations' highest court has ruled that the UK's administration of the territory is ""unlawful"" and must end. Most personnel and resources on Diego Garcia are under the control of the US, including the majority of the accommodation and transport on the island as well as restaurants and shops. The US military commander can refuse access to areas operated or controlled by the US military for security reasons. In a witness statement, Biot’s deputy commissioner, Nishi Dholakia, said it was not possible to “make alternative arrangements to replace the logistical support which the US was due to provide” in time for the scheduled court hearing this week. The room where the hearing had been scheduled to take place was only usable with US co-operation, he said.  Biot's official website states access to the island is only permitted to “those with connections either to the military facility or to the Territory’s Administration”. Diego Garcia has been described as an important strategic base for the US. Earlier this year, two B-52 bombers were sent there for training exercises.  In recent decades, US planes have been sent from the base to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq. The UK government has confirmed that rendition flights landed on the territory in 2002 to refuel there, though former CIA director Michael Hayden has denied reports that it has ever been used to house and interrogate terror suspects. The dozens of Sri Lankan Tamils who landed on the island in October 2021 are the first people to file asylum claims on Biot. About 60 people, including at least 16 children, remain there - guarded by private security company G4S - as complex legal battles are fought over their fate. This week’s hearing was due to be the first time that they would meet their lawyers in person. There have been multiple suicide attempts on the island, and reports of sexual harassment and assaults allegedly committed by migrants within the camp. Some migrants have been flown to Rwanda for medical treatment following self-harm and suicide attempts, and those with successful claims are waiting for a “safe third country” to be identified to resettle them in. United Nations representatives visited the camp late last year and reported that conditions there amounted to arbitrary detention. During Tuesday’s virtual hearing, one of the migrants on the island collapsed multiple times. The Foreign Office has previously told the BBC that the island is not suitable for migrants to live on and that it is “working tirelessly to process the migrants' claims for protection and to find a suitable third country for those whose claims are upheld”. “At all times, the welfare and safety of migrants on Biot has been our top priority,” it said earlier this year.

201,Weinstein faces new sex assault investigation in NY,"Harvey Weinstein is being investigated for ""additional violent sexual assaults"" months after a previous conviction in New York was overturned, a court in Manhattan has heard. Nicole Blumberg, an assistant district attorney, told Tuesday's hearing that the alleged assaults fell within the statute of limitations, but did not say when prosecutors would be ready to press any fresh charges. The disgraced film mogul, 72, is already facing a retrial after his 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned in April on the basis that it was unfair. ""As we said in 2020, there were women who were not ready to proceed with the legal process. Some of those women are now ready to proceed,"" Ms Blumberg told Tuesday's hearing.  Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala told the hearing that the new investigations were a delay tactic, adding: ""Once again we have a hotline: 1-800 Get Harvey."" Mr Aidala added that his client was suffering from a host of medical problems while being held in solitary confinement at New York's Rikers Island jail. Weinstein was brought into court on Tuesday with his left hand cuffed to his wheelchair. Weinstein's 2020 conviction was crucial for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in the media of sexual misconduct. The Miramax film studio founder was sentenced to 23 years in prison for sexually assaulting production assistant Miriam Haley and raping actress Jessica Mann. However, the New York Court of Appeals in April found evidence presented about Weinstein's ""prior bad acts"" from three witnesses unconnected to the charges against him violated the right to a fair trial.  Members of the #MeToo movement described the decision as ""profoundly unjust"", while lawyers for his victims said the decision to retry was a ""leap backwards"" and ""tragic"". A retrial has been scheduled to begin after the Labour Day holiday on 2 September, although no specific date has been set. Ms Blumberg said on Tuesday  that prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November. Weinstein was also convicted  to 16 years following a separate rape trial in California. That conviction was not affected by the New York appeal court's decision, and he has not begun serving the California sentence. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He denies all charges against him. ",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjk3jy3vyk5o,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-09 19:11:34,
200,Gladiator II: Paul Mescal battles a rhino in upcoming film,"The trailer for Ridley Scott's sequel to Gladiator has dropped, showcasing several epic scenes, including a water battle in Rome's Colosseum and Paul Mescal being rammed by a rhino.  All Of Us Strangers star Mescal plays Lucius, fighting for his life as a gladiator, despite his high status as nephew of corrupt former Emperor Commodus.  Sir Ridley's first film in 2000, which starred Russell Crowe as soldier-turned-gladiator Maximus, won five Oscars including best actor. The trailer opens as Lucius recalls his childhood memory, when ex-Roman commander Maximus battled his uncle in the arena. ""I remember that day. I never forgot it, that a slave could take revenge against an emperor,"" Lucius says, before we see him in a flashback from the first film, being dragged to safety by his mother.  Here's a quick recap of the first Gladiator film: the plot revolves around upstanding Roman general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, who was asked to inherit the role of emperor from ailing Marcus Aurelius.  But Commodus murdered the emperor and took the title, before killing Maximus' family and leaving him a slave. Maximus rose up to become a gladiator, returning to Rome in order to exact his revenge.  World History Encyclopedia describes gladiatorial contests as ""bloody entertainment... an opportunity for emperors to display their wealth"", where up to 50,000 spectators enjoyed ""contests which were literally a matter of life and death"".  Some battles included wild animals - Gladiator featured tigers in the arena, while an angry-looking rhino with a bloodied horn charges at Mescal in the sequel.  It's fair to say the first film caused a flurry of excitement among admirers of Crowe's powerful portrayal of Maximus.  Given Mescal enjoyed a huge surge in his fanbase after he starred in BBC drama Normal People, it's possible his role in Gladiator II may have a similar impact.   Lucius is undoubtedly reminiscent of the honourable Maximus, battling from below while having a much higher purpose.  In the sequel, Lucius has been captured from his home far from Rome, and brought there as a prisoner. He becomes a gladiator, working for Macrinus, played by Denzel Washington, who sponsors fighters much like Oliver Reed's Proximo did in the first film.  Lucius protects his birthright, saying he doesn't know where he was born, adding: ""I never knew a mother and or father."" ""You will be my instrument,"" Macrinus responds.  It appears that the twin emperors now in place -  played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger - are also corrupt. We see them laugh demonically while gladiators die in their mock water battle (which did happen in real life).  Lucius's mother, Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen in the original film as well, watches with horror while her son fights beneath her, although we don't know if she recognises him.   However we see her take him full circle, back to Maximus, by giving him a ring which belonged to the Roman general before he died. Like the original, the film appears to be about the corruption of power, with worthy, embattled individuals taking on the might of Rome's rulers. Lucius favours ""strength and honour"", while another Roman general, Marcus Acacius, played by The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal, says: ""I will not waste another generation of young men for their vanity,"" alongside footage of the emperors.  We don't yet know enough about Pascal's character to know where his morals fully lie.  The trailer ends with Mescal and Pascal battling in the arena, with the gladiator looking like he has the advantage, as he holds two swords crossed over the army general's neck.  Initial responses on X were a mixture of both positive and negative, with some people excited for the sequel, while others said it wouldn't be as good as the original. Some fans spotted what looked like sharks in the water battle, with filmmaker Kyle Prohaska saying: ""I'm all in on Gladiator II. I'll go just for some of those insane sequences. Sharks in the arena? A rhino? Denzel? Come on. This is definitely one of those sequels nobody asked for, but this one looks better than most."" Another post, from a user called @FilmmakerJeff, called the trailer ""underwhelming"". ""I hate to report that I’m not a fan of the Gladiator II trailer,"" he said.  ""Terrible music choice, nothing from it gave me reassurance that it could be even close to as good as the original, and honestly, it looks like it could be pretty good at best. My hype meter dropped a notch.""  There was also disagreement on social media over the soundtrack, which was No Church in the Wild, by Jay-Z and Kanye West.  One user wrote: ""In what world does the sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator need Jay-Z and Kanye West? Stop shoehorning songs into trailers."" Another in favour though, wrote: ""That pounding hip-hop really works on the Gladiator 2 trailer. Fits so well to the era."" Sir Ridley, who made 2023's epic Oscar and Bafta-nominated film Napoleon, told Deadline last year that he made Gladiator II because ""economically, it makes sense...  ""I thought the [first] film was, as it were, completely satisfactory, creatively complete, so why muck with it, right?  ""But these cycles keep going on and on and on, they repeat globally for the last 20 years. It started to spell itself out as an obvious thing to do, and that’s how it evolved.""

197,Elephants trample Spanish man to death in S Africa,"A Spanish tourist has been trampled to death by elephants after climbing out of his car to take photos of the herd at a game reserve in South Africa. The unnamed 43-year-old man was visiting Pilanesberg National Park on Sunday morning with his fiancee and two other people when the attack happened, according to police. The group had been driving around in their own vehicle before spotting three elephants with three calves, officers said. Once the man got out of the car and walked towards the herd, the matriarch became ""agitated"" and charged at him, said Pieter Nel, a spokesman for the local tourism board. Unable to escape, the man was then trampled on by the rest of the herd. Local media report that the man was taken to hospital but died of his injuries.  The group of people he was visiting the park with - all residents of Johannesburg - were unharmed, say police. The force says an investigation is now under way. South Africa's national parks attract more than a million visitors each year. Officials say it is crucial that visitors follow safety precautions. ""Tourists are constantly reminded about the importance of staying inside their vehicles when visiting the park, and to keep a good distance between animals and their vehicles and give animals a chance to move freely, and to only get out of vehicles in safely designated areas,"" said Thami Matshego, chief executive officer of the North West Parks and Tourism Board, speaking to local news outlet Netwerk24. It was ""normal behaviour"" for wild elephants to defend their young, said Mr Nel, of the same tourism body.

202,"Israeli strike on Gaza camp kills 29 and injures dozens, hospital says","At least 29 Palestinians have been killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on a camp for displaced people outside a school in southern Gaza, hospital officials say. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said the strike had hit next to the gate of al-Awda school in the town of Abasan al-Kabira, east of the city of Khan Younis, and put the initial death toll at 25. One video showed more than a dozen dead and seriously wounded people, including several children, on the floor of a local hospital. The Israeli military said it had used ""precise munition"" to target a ""terrorist from Hamas' military wing"" who, it said, had taken part in the 7 October attack on Israel. It said it was ""looking into the reports that civilians were harmed"" ""adjacent"" to al-Awda school. The incident comes a week after the Israeli military ordered civilians to evacuate Abasan al-Kabira and other areas of eastern Khan Younis, prompting tens of thousands to flee. One source at the Nasser hospital, where the injured from Abasan al-Kabira were taken, said they expected the number of dead to increase.  Al-Awda school houses displaced people from the eastern villages of Khan Younis. The attack resulted in widespread destruction and the deaths of women and children. Body parts were scattered across the site and many people staying in tents outside the school were also injured. This is the fourth attack on or near to schools sheltering displaced people in the past four days.  The Israeli military said it had carried out the first three strikes because Hamas politicians, police officers and fighters were using them as bases: The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 38,240 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880k3930rmo,"David Gritten,",2024-07-09 22:22:34,
214,The secret hospitals offering criminals new faces,"Clandestine hospitals in the Philippines have been offering plastic surgery services to fugitives and scam centre workers to help them evade arrest, authorities say. Two such illegal hospitals could be shut down ""in the coming weeks"" after police raided the first one in Manila's southern suburbs in May, a police spokesman told the BBC. Hair transplant tools, dental implants and skin whitening IV drips were seized from the hospital in Pasay City two months ago. ""You can create an entirely new person out of those,"" said Winston John Casio, a spokesman for the Presidential Anti-Organised Crime Commission (PAOCC). The two illegal hospitals under surveillance are believed to be four times larger than the one in Pasay, authorities said. Their clients allegedly include those from online casinos, who are working in the Philippines illegally, Mr Casio said. The online casinos or Pogos (Philippine Online Gaming Operations) cater to players in mainland China, where gambling is illegal. But police say Pogos have been used as cover for criminal activities such as telephone scams and human trafficking. Three doctors - two from Vietnam and one from China - a Chinese pharmacist, and a Vietnamese nurse were arrested in the Pasay raid, none of whom were licensed to work in the Philippines. Authorities also found a hemodialysis machine, suggesting that the facility, which was about 400 sqm, offered various medical treatments in addition to plastic surgery. ""They look like regular clinics on the outside, but once you enter, you'll be shocked by the type of technology they have,"" Mr Casio said. “These Pogo hospitals don’t ask for the proper identification cards... You could be a fugitive, or you could be an illegal alien in the Philippines,” he said. Authorities were tipped off on the existence of the illegal hospital in Pasay City. Pogos flourished under former president Rodrigo Duterte, who sought friendly ties with China during his six-year term that ended in 2022. However, his successor Ferdinand Marcos Jr has mounted a crackdown on Pogos, citing their criminal links. ""The president does not want the Philippines to be painted as a 'scam hub' and has given us a directive to go after scam farms because of how they have been targeting large numbers of people from all over the world,"" Mr Casio said. In December 2022, immigration officials arrested a suspected Chinese mafia member who allegedly underwent plastic surgery to evade detection. Such cases may be linked to the underground hospitals, Mr Casio said.  The mayor of a sleepy town north of the capital, Alice Guo, recently came under fire after a Pogo scam centre was busted near her office. She has also been accused of being a spy for China after authorities questioned her birth records.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g7x318r6o,"Kelly Ng,",2024-07-09 10:11:35,
217,What to know as Alec Baldwin's Rust shooting trial begins,"A jury has been picked to hear the trial of Alec Baldwin for a fatal shooting on a film set in New Mexico.  Mr Baldwin, 66, faces an involuntary manslaughter charge, which he denies, in the October 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.  The 42-year-old was killed after a gun Mr Baldwin was using in a scene rehearsal for  the movie Rust went off. A bullet from the gun fatally struck the cinematographer and wounded director Joel Souza. The 12 jurors and four alternates who will decide the case were selected on Tuesday after prosecutors and Mr Baldwin's attorneys questioned them about everything from their political affiliation to their knowledge of the case.  Opening statements are set to begin in the Santa Fe, New Mexico, court on Wednesday morning.  Mr Baldwin - best known for playing Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for portraying Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live - was joined in court by family including his wife, Hilaria. He has pleaded not guilty to the felony charge.  He maintains that he did not pull the trigger, and says the gun went off when he cocked the revolver's hammer. His defence team argues that it was the responsibility of other crew members to ensure the gun was safe. But prosecutors have called this claim ""absurd"", alleging that the actor did not share this information when first interviewed after the shooting and argued he had a responsibility to follow basic gun safety. In October 2021, Mr Baldwin, was rehearsing on the set of the Western near Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was practising a cross-body draw of the gun, as the director called for him to point it at the camera in an upcoming scene.  Mr Baldwin -  who boasts a 40-year acting career - had a starring role in the film, which he was also co-producing. He was portraying an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter.  As he pointed the revolver during the rehearsal, it went off. A bullet from the weapon hit Ms Hutchins in the chest, also striking director Joel Souza in the shoulder. Ms Hutchins was flown to hospital by helicopter but died of her injuries. Mr Souza was taken by ambulance from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch. Court documents show that Mr Baldwin and others on set did not know the gun was loaded or that it contained live ammunition.  It was discovered later that the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, brought a box of live bullets to the film set from her California home. Prosecutors said those live rounds slowly spread through the set over the course of 12 days. Gutierrez-Reed, who loaded the gun for Mr Baldwin before the shooting, was charged and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Ms Hutchins' death. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison - the maximum sentence.  Judge Mary Sommers, who oversaw the case, said Gutierrez-Reed's mistake had cost Ms Hutchins her life by turning ""a safe weapon into a lethal weapon"". David Halls, an assistant director and safety co-ordinator, has also pleaded guilty to unsafe handling of a firearm. One of the key questions in the case is this: did Mr Baldwin pull the trigger or did the gun malfunction? Several weeks after the fatal shooting, Mr Baldwin told ABC News in a high-profile interview that he did not pull the trigger.  Legal experts say this has forced the actor into a much narrower defence, as he cannot allege that he did not remember what occurred or that it happened by accident.  Prosecutors, meanwhile, have painted Mr Baldwin as an unsafe firearm handler, showing footage of him waving around weapons on set and saying in filings that he was unable to control his emotions.  They also cited an FBI report that tested Mr Baldwin's claim. It found that the gun's ""trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer"".  During the analysis of the weapon in 2022, an FBI examiner took a mallet to the weapon and broke its internal components. Mr Baldwin's lawyers have called this ""outrageous"" and argued the destroyed weapon deprived the defence of a full opportunity to examine the gun in its original condition. But a judge denied a last-ditch effort to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge. Tre Lovell, a trial lawyer in California, says prosecutors will argue that even though Mr Baldwin was on a film set, it does not alleviate him from basic gun-handling skills and safety duties. They will argue that anybody who holds a gun, whether on a film set or in real life, has an obligation to never point it at someone and to ensure it is not loaded with live rounds. Prosecutors attempted to argue during a pre-trial hearing that Mr Baldwin had greater safety responsibilities on set as a producer, but Judge Sommer sided with the defence and said this was irrelevant to the case.  That means Mr Baldwin's role as producer - a credit given for raising money, creative input, or physical production work - will not be included in the trial.  But his defence team still has much work ahead to win its case, Mr Lovell says, as it will need to help the jury understand a film set - a space in which people have designated roles and obligations. “They need to show the jury that once you start imposing a duty on an actor to ensure that a prop is safe, set will go into chaos,” he said.  ""There's no evidence that he [Baldwin] would have even known the difference between the dummy bullet and a real bullet."" Mr Baldwin's legal team will also likely argue that the actor should have been able to rely on the film's armourer and safety coordinator - Gutierrez-Reed and Halls, respectively - to ensure he could perform his job without worry.  Mr Baldwin is not currently scheduled to testify at the trial, but that does not mean it will not happen.  Most legal experts agree there are very few reasons to have a defendant testify at any trial because it allows prosecutors the chance to cross-examine them.  Mr Baldwin's defence team can wait until towards the end of the trial to make a decision based on how the proceedings have gone. The trial is scheduled to last 10 days.  Gutierrez-Reed did not testify during her trial. Mr Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison due to the charges related to Ms Hutchins' death.  Gutierrez-Reed, who faced the same charge in the fatal shooting, received the maximum sentence.  But even if the jury finds Mr Baldwin not guilty, his legal troubles will not be over.  He faces several civil lawsuits, including one brought by Ms Hutchins's family.  In a negligence legal action, they claim the cinematographer's death and other injuries and fatalities were ""a likely result"" on a movie set that contained guns, live ammunition and the actor ""inexplicably"" pointing and firing a gun at Ms Hutchins. Mr Baldwin has said in recent court filings that he has struggled to find acting work since the incident.  In May, the actor and his wife Hilaria announced that they and their seven children would star in a reality show next year.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz47qr0z17lo,"Emma Vardy, Samantha Granville and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-09 22:58:35,
216,What to expect from Iran's new president,"Iran’s president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian stood as a wildcard candidate, and defied expectations to win the presidency against hardline rival Saeed Jalili. Mr Pezeshkian is notable because he is ""a reformist"". But not the liberal-minded, democracy-loving kind of reformist, in the universal sense. In Iran, ""the reformists"" are one ideological faction of the Islamic Republic's ruling elite.  They are Islamists, like their conservative rivals, but believe a more moderate version of the regime’s ideology could better serve both the ruling clergy and Iranian society. Reformists led the administration from 1997 until 2005 and were part of a de facto coalition when Hassan Rouhani, a conservative who became a centrist, was president between 2013 and 2021. They have often called for a freer and more democratic society. But in the 2024 election, unlike the previous reformist administration in the late 1990s, promises for a freer and more democratic society were not part of their campaign. Since the 1990s, Iran has experienced multiple waves of dissent and oppression. Even reformists themselves have faced severe political crackdowns, with many high-profile figures spending time in jail over the last two decades. Though members of the establishment, It is widely acknowledged that they lack influence over crucial centres of power, such as the Supreme Leader’s Office, the Guardian Council, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and the Supreme National Security Council. When hardline former president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May and Mr Pezeshkian prepared his presidential campaign, he chose a strategy very similar to Hassan Rouhani’s in 2013: focusing on the economic hardship the country has been facing for years due to Western sanctions - and blaming their conservative rivals for causing this situation with their “radical” anti-West stances.  As part of his campaign, Mr Pezeshkian recruited Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s former foreign minister who helped strike the nuclear deal in 2015. Although Mr Zarif is not a reformist per se, he campaigned heavily for Mr Pezeshkian. In his manifesto, Mr Pezeshkian declared that his foreign policy would be “not anti-West, nor anti-East.” He criticised former president Raisi’s policies of moving the country closer to Russia and China and insisted that the only way to resolve the economic crisis is through negotiations with the West to end the nuclear standoff and ease the sanctions.  However, during the campaign, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised these ideas. Mr Khamenei called those who believe in achieving prosperity through friendlier relations with the US “deluded,” - pointing to the fact that it was the US, not Iran, that withdrew from the nuclear deal. According to the Iranian constitution, Mr Khamenei is the main decision-maker; an 85-year-old Shia cleric who was a revolutionary in 1979 and climbed the power ladder to become the head of state in 1989. He is known for his ideological animosity towards Israel and the United States, his deep distrust of the West, and in the last two decades, his active support for a doctrine called “look to the East,” which means ending the old non-aligned policy and leaning towards China and Russia on the global stage. One of the most important aspects of Iran’s policies in the region is what the Quds Force (the external arm of the IRGC) does. The president does not have any direct control over them, and only the Supreme Leader can decide their actions. Mr Khamenei repeatedly – including just three days before the first round of this election – stated that what the Quds Force does is essential for the country’s security doctrine. So when Mr Pezeshkian talks about a different foreign policy with a friendlier approach to the West, the chance of changes in Iran’s activities in countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen are slim. Nevertheless, the president is the highest-ranking Iranian diplomat, and the foreign ministry can still help shape and implement policy. They have the opportunity to push for their vision through behind-the-door political lobbying, as happened in 2015 when then-centrist President Hassan Rouhani convinced the hardliners, including Mr Khamenei himself, to accept the deal. Moreover, the administration could significantly impact public discourse and promote policies that might not fully align with Mr Khamenei’s stance. Such nuances are the reformists' only hope to do what they promised and bring down what Mr Pezeshkian called the “walls that have been built around the country by the hardliners.”",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05x9lw3zwo,"Kayvan Hosseini,",2024-07-09 05:11:35,
215,McEnroe defends 'Darth Vader' Djokovic,"This video can not be played McEnroe shares his view on Djokovic frustrations John McEnroe praised Novak Djokovic for criticising the Wimbledon crowd, saying the Serb had been disrespected in his career at least 100 times. The tennis legend said Djokovic's ability to deal with the ""worst heat"" is why he has become the greatest player of all time. Djokovic spoke out against fans after his Wimbledon fourth-round win, claiming they used the bellowing of his opponent Holger Rune's surname as ""an excuse to boo"". The 24-time Grand Slam champion insisted the noise - fans elongating the first vowel in Rune's surname - was designed to wind him up. McEnroe, who won seven singles majors, agreed with the 37-year-old Serb. Asked by presenter Clare Balding on BBC TV about what he would say to Djokovic, the 65-year-old American said it would be: ""Well done."" McEnroe added: ""Don't you think there's been at least 100 matches over the course of the last 10-15 years that Djokovic has been disrespected because of how good he is? ""What has he done that's so bad? Name something. What is it, he wants it? He competes as hard as anyone who's ever competed? Is it the look, where he's from? ""He's like the Darth Vader compared to two of the classiest acts we've seen play tennis - Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. ""Who can compare to them in terms of what they brought to the table? Nobody - and then this guy Djokovic spoils the party. ""So then how about respecting him after all this? ""He's by far the guy who's taken the worst heat and that's why I would say he's the greatest that's ever played."" Djokovic wore a mask of the Darth Vader character, a villain from the Star Wars sci-fi films, for his walk-on to a match in 2012, recalling in 2022 how ""that was myself in the crazy, young days"". This video can not be played Djokovic expresses anger towards Rune supporters For anyone intending to make Djokovic angry, there can be consequences. In fact, he might very well want you to do that. Winding up the seven-time Wimbledon champion, as some Centre Court fans did by accident or design on Monday, seems to further fuel his insatiable desire for success. ""If there were people in the crowd trying to antagonise him and wanted Rune to win - that's the worst thing you can do,"" former Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman told BBC Sport. ""He loves the confrontation. He thrives off that energy. And he plays better. ""He destroyed Rune. ""If you want to try and upset Djokovic's performance you should just sit quietly."" On Wednesday, Djokovic returns to the same evening slot on Centre Court for his quarter-final against Australia's Alex de Minaur. Henman thinks the crowd's reaction towards Djokovic will be ""great"" and believes Monday night's drama will not have any bearing on the atmosphere. ""At 37 years of age, and with what Djokovic has achieved, I love that passion and hunger and desire to win. It's brilliant,"" said the former British number one. Over the years, we have often seen Djokovic feeding off negative energy to produce some of his finest tennis. Being a rebel with a cause is how many believe he likes it. ""I think he wants to hear the boos - that makes him play better,"" said former Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis. ""If I were to play him I would just give him compliments at the change of ends. I wouldn't want to annoy that guy, that's for sure."" Nenad Zimonjic, who has been described by Djokovic as an ""older brother"", presented a slightly different view. Former Wimbledon doubles champion Zimonjic spent time as a Davis Cup team-mate of Djokovic and was also part of his coaching team earlier this year. ""I think he prefers when the crowd is for him,"" the 48-year-old Serb told BBC Sport. ""But he finds a way to use it the other way round as well."" 'An excuse to boo' - Djokovic irked by Wimbledon crowd Djokovic beats Rune - then accuses fans of 'disrespect' Wimbledon changes finals plan and confirms rain 'last resort' This video can not be played Novak Djokovic discusses his post-match comments about the Wimbledon crowd with BBC Sport. Despite being the second most successful man in the Open era at the All England Club, Djokovic's relationship with the British crowd has blown hot and cold. That is largely because of the popularity of the player he is trying to match on eight titles: Federer. In the epic 2019 final when Djokovic beat Federer, the Serb had the majority of the crowd against him in an atmosphere which felt almost tribal. Afterwards, Djokovic's former coach Boris Becker said there should have been more respect shown by the partisan crowd. Two years ago, Djokovic was booed on Centre Court after he blew a kiss to fans following his semi-final win over Briton Cameron Norrie. ""The reality is, in Djokovic's world, the comparison is Federer,"" added Henman. ""Federer is one of the most popular athletes in the whole of sport and I think Djokovic has always craved that same level of attention. ""You can debate whether that will ever happen - it probably won't."" Djokovic has often tried going on the charm offensive. The gesture of triumphantly throwing his heart to all corners of the court was designed to help Djokovic draw out the crowd's love. Post-match interviews featuring witty, charismatic and respectful answers demonstrate the engaging side of his personality. Occasionally, as we saw on Monday, he is still tipped over the edge by what he says is disrespect. ""I think for somebody who has been as successful as he is, he's still very confused as to why he doesn't get the love of the people the way that Federer and Nadal did,"" added former British number one Annabel Croft on BBC Radio 5 Live.

213,Democrats look to Kamala Harris - but could she beat Trump?,"On Saturday afternoon, US Vice-President Kamala Harris sat on stage at a black cultural festival in New Orleans, talking about her life story and what she felt she had achieved in the White House. It was the kind of event that the first female, black and South Asian American vice-president has regularly attended throughout her three-and-a-half years as Joe Biden’s deputy, usually trailed by a small press pack dwarfed by that which follows the president himself. But as panicked Democrats a thousand miles away in Washington weighed replacing 81-year-old Joe Biden as the party’s candidate for November’s election following his woeful and sometimes incomprehensible debate performance against Donald Trump, the number of reporters trailing Ms Harris had swelled to dozens. On stage and through her travels this weekend, the vice-president did not address swirling questions about Mr Biden’s fitness for office and whether he should withdraw and hand the baton to her. But in discussing ambition and how to forge your own path with her audience in New Orleans, she encouraged the crowd not to listen to naysayers. “People in your life will tell you, though, it’s not your time. It’s not your turn. Nobody like you has done it before,"" she said. ""Don’t you ever listen to that."" Since the disastrous CNN debate on 27 June, she has repeatedly defended her boss, arguing that his record as president shouldn’t be outweighed by 90 minutes on a debate stage. Mr Biden himself has struck a defiant tone and fiercely insisted that he will remain the nominee. Yet as calls grow louder for the president to step aside, some high-profile Democrats are unifying behind 59-year-old Ms Harris as the natural candidate to replace him. On Sunday, congressman Adam Schiff of California told NBC's Meet The Press that either Mr Biden had to be able to “win overwhelmingly or he has to pass the torch to someone who can”. Kamala Harris, he added, could “very well win overwhelmingly” against Trump. That’s a proposition that has raised eyebrows among some Democrats, including Biden allies, who see in Ms Harris a vice-president who failed in her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination before the first ballot was even cast and who has struggled with an uneven record and low approval ratings throughout her time in the White House. Against that, senior Democratic lawmakers like Mr Schiff and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn have been floating Ms Harris as the obvious successor should Mr Biden ultimately bow to party pressure. Supporters point to a handful of polls that suggest she would perform better than the president in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump, and they argue she has the national profile, campaign infrastructure and appeal to younger voters that could make the transition seamless four months before election day. An elevation to the top of the ticket would be a remarkable turnaround for a woman not long ago seen as a political weakness by senior figures in the Biden White House. Even Mr Biden himself reportedly described her as a “work in progress"" during their first months in office. But Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist and Harris’s former communications director, said she had long been underestimated. “Whether she’s a partner to the president or she has to lead the ticket, she is somebody who Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,” Mr Simmons told the BBC. Since the debate and its fall-out, Ms Harris has altered her schedule to stick close to the president. She appeared at a heavily-scrutinised meeting last Wednesday where Mr Biden sought to reassure powerful Democratic governors about his fitness for office. And a day later, on the Fourth of July - America’s Independence Day - she abandoned her usual tradition of grilling hotdogs for firefighters and Secret Service agents at her Los Angeles home to be by Mr Biden’s side at the White House celebrations. The former top prosecutor has focused on criticising Trump in public appearances since the debate, pressing the case as to why voters should believe he is a threat to democracy and women’s rights. At the same time, she has offered nothing but steadfast support for Mr Biden. Vice-presidents always need to strike a delicate balancing act between ambition and loyalty, but Ms Harris knows that this is not a moment where she can show any daylight between her and the president. Kamala Harris is, however, far from the only alternative to Mr Biden being discussed. The list of potential Biden replacements ranges from a cadre of popular governors - Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Illinois’ JB Pritzker - to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California congressman Ro Khanna. Ms Harris and her staff have refused to engage in public speculation. But her team is keenly aware of the behind-the-scenes conversations taking place as some party members coalesce behind her. A memo circulated online, purportedly written by Democratic operatives, laid out a detailed argument to promote Ms Harris despite her “real political weaknesses”. Trying to choose anyone other than her would throw the campaign into disarray and keep ""Democratic bickering"" in the media spotlight for months, it argues. If Mr Biden were to give up the nomination, the idea of the Democrats passing over Ms Harris in favour of another candidate appalls many on the left of the party and in its powerful black caucus. In that situation, ""this party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms Harris"", Mr Clyburn, one of the most prominent black lawmakers in Congress, told MSNBC last week. Republicans, too, have acknowledged Ms Harris would be the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned on Sunday that Republicans must be ready for a “dramatically different race” should Ms Harris - whom he described as a “vigorous” candidate - become the nominee. Mr Graham emphasised her progressive California brand, suggesting she was closer in policy terms to left-wing firebrand Bernie Sanders than Joe Biden, in what appeared to be a glimpse of a Republican attack line should she become the candidate. For his part, Donald Trump has called her “pathetic” in the days since the debate. But ultimately the only question that matters for many Democrats - including deep-pocketed donors - is if she has a better chance of beating Trump than Joe Biden does. And that is deeply uncertain. Harris backers point to a recent CNN poll suggesting she would fare better than the president against Trump in November. In a head-to-head contest, Ms Harris trailed the Republican by only two points, while Mr Biden lagged six points behind him. The poll also suggested Ms Harris performed better than Mr Biden with independent voters and women. But many polling experts dismiss such hypothetical surveys, noting voter sentiment would change if Mr Biden actually decided to step aside and the Democrats entertained other potential candidates. One Democratic pollster close to the Biden campaign acknowledged that Ms Harris may have more potential to expand the party’s voter base than the president, but was sceptical about how much of a difference she would make. Surveys pitting her against Trump at this stage “don’t mean anything”, said the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Ms Harris, the child of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, performs better in surveys than Mr Biden with black, Latino and young voters - critical constituencies that allies say she could energise as the nominee. But whether she would actually boost turnout among younger voters of colour is another uncertain question. “This is just a wait and see moment,” the pollster said. Some in the party are also asking whether Ms Harris’ progressive reputation risks losing the union and blue-collar voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that Mr Biden narrowly won in 2020 and which both parties need to secure a win in November. Should she take over the ticket, some Democrats have suggested that Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina could be picked as running mate to capture centrist voters in Midwestern states. Given the ages of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, voters are paying far more attention to the VP candidate of both parties in this election cycle, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for the 2020 Biden campaign. On the Republican side, Trump has yet to announce his running mate, although many speculate he’ll pick North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Ohio Senator JD Vance. Deep concerns among some Democrats about Harris's strength as a presidential candidate date back to her unsuccesful 2020 bid for the party's nomination, in which she landed blows on Mr Biden in an early debate but then crashed out before the first caucuses in Iowa. Critics said she struggled to define herself as a candidate, a sentiment that has lingered throughout her tenure as vice-president. She had a shaky start in the White House, marked by high-profile interview slip-ups, low approval ratings and staff turnover. She was also tasked with overseeing the administration’s strategy to reduce migration over the US southern border, which increased to record levels over the last three years and remains a major vulnerability for the campaign. Those early stumbles led Ms Harris to be more cautious about her public appearances but many voters perceive her as ineffective and absent. “People need to know more about her, what economic issues she is strong on and they need to be reminded of the role she’s played,” Ms Lake said. Over the last year, Ms Harris has found stable footing as the administration’s leading voice on abortion rights, an issue that proved successful for Democrats during the 2022 midterm elections and one the party hopes will win back more voters in November. As a former prosecutor who handled sexual violence cases, she has invoked personal stories of working with women who miscarried in the bathroom or were turned away at hospitals as she’s tried to mobilise voters around the issue. On the campaign trail, she has also sought to capitalise on other issues that resonate with young voters, including student debt forgiveness, climate change and gun violence. The White House, too, has made a concerted effort to promote her more forcefully. Still, she faces an uphill battle to change longstanding voter scepticism - her approval ratings hover around 37% in polling averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight - a level similar to both Mr Biden and Trump. And unless Mr Biden himself caves to the mounting party pressure to step down, grassroots Democratic supporters themselves seem resigned to supporting the current ticket. At the Essence festival in New Orleans, Iam Christian Tucker, a 41-year-old small business owner from New Orleans, said she didn’t care, ultimately, who the nominee was. She said she liked Kamala Harris, but she wasn’t sure if a black female president could win election. “I’m voting against Donald Trump more than anything,” she told the BBC. Greg Hovel, 67, who attended a rally for President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, last week, said he supported Ms Harris in the 2020 primary and “has always been a fan,” though he cautioned there is “a lot of anti-woman sentiment in this country.” “I think she would make an excellent president,” Mr Hovel said. “But I still think Biden can win.” Mike Wendling contributed to this report from Madison, Wisconsin  BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

208,Indian wrestlers eye Olympics after sex harassment scandal,"Over a year after protests against sexual harassment allegations shook Indian wrestling, female athletes are gearing up for major events, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. The BBC spoke to young wrestlers about their journey. Reetika Hooda almost didn't make it. The 23-year-old is among the five Indian women wrestlers to qualify for the Olympics this year. It’s a hard-won opportunity, following a year of setbacks that shook her confidence. She knew she needed more training and competitions to improve her game. A year ago, all wrestling came to a halt in India after its federation chief Brij Bhushan Singh was accused of sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations. India’s sports ministry did not sack Singh but it disbanded the federation after finding several lapses, including the non-compliance of sexual harassment laws, and set up a temporary team to run things. It was an unprecedented time. Hooda remembers watching the country’s most accomplished wrestlers, including her inspiration Sakshi Malik - the only Indian woman to win an Olympic medal in wrestling - camp on the roads of Delhi, demanding Singh’s resignation. The protest made headlines globally, especially after the police detained the wrestlers when they tried to march to India's new parliament building. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) condemned the way the wrestlers were treated and called for an impartial inquiry into their complaints. “It was sad - not only because of what was happening but also what wasn’t,” Hooda told me. Each year, the International Olympic Committee designates certain tournaments as qualification events for the games. To compete, wrestlers must earn ranking points in trials, win national competitions, and secure the Wrestling Federation of India's (WFI) approval. But instead of competing, Hooda stared at an empty sporting calendar for weeks. “We trained but there were no trials, which meant we could not compete and know our shortcomings. There was a constant fear that we won’t be prepared [for the Olympics],” she said. For a country that’s won only 24 medals at individual events in Olympics, with over a quarter in wrestling, this was worrying. Fresh elections to the WFI were finally held in December 2023, nearly a year after the protests began. The wrestlers had asked India's sports minister to prevent people associated with Singh from participating in the election. Singh did not contest as he had already served the maximum of three terms. But his close aide Sanjay Singh was elected the chief after a landslide victory. This sparked outrage among women wrestlers. On the same day, Olympic medallist Malik quit the sport in protest. “Even now I get emotional when I think of that moment,” Malik said. “Wrestling took me to such heights, got me love and respect, and I had to give it up.” Young wrestlers were stunned by Malik’s decision – but soon, they were back on the mat. “Sakshi Malik was the reason I took up wrestling,” said Tanu Malik, a 20-year-old wrestler in Haryana state. “So when I saw her crying, I thought to myself, she fought for us, we can’t give up now.” From that day, Tanu Malik decided to work harder. Her training at the state’s all-women Yudhvir Wrestling Academy starts at 04:30. The day starts with a rigorous five-hour fitness session, lifting large truck tyres and practicing wrestling techniques. After a break for food and rest, the women resume training for another five hours in the afternoon. Girls as young as 12 years sweat it out on the mat. In their free time, they talk about  diets and share recipes that would help them stay fit. None of them want to talk about the alleged sexual harassment at academies or the accusations against the former wrestling chief. However, they are determined not to give up. Seema Kharab, a coach, says that contrary to expectations, the number of girls at the academy has not dropped since the protests. “The protests have assured young wrestlers that it is possible to raise their voice, that positive action may be taken and they can get support within the system,” she says. In June, the police charged Brij Bhushan Singh with stalking, harassment, intimidation, and making ""sexually coloured remarks"", but a court granted him bail Meanwhile, the new federation chief, Sanjay Singh, has taken on the mantle. He acknowledged his 30-year relationship with the former chief but dismissed allegations of Brij Bhushan Singh's interference, claiming wrestlers had accepted him as the new head. He said this was evident from the “massive turnout” at national wrestling competitions this year. “No-one will be favoured or discriminated against and each wrestler is dear to me. I am also the father of two daughters and I understand what daughters need,” he added. However, for young women like Tanu Malik, fear has become an inescapable part of being in the profession. “It’s not easy - my parents are constantly worried about sending me to training alone,” she says. “But they have to trust us, otherwise how would things work? It’s like accepting defeat without even fighting.” Others feel deflated and say the protests have come at a huge personal cost for them. Shiksha Kharab, a gold medallist at the Asian Championship, says it caused disruptions in training because of which young wrestlers have lost a crucial year. But Sakshi Malik has no regrets. “The most important thing is to fight,” she said. “I don’t think anybody in any sporting federation would dare to do anything, they now know that harassment can have repercussions.” Hooda says she's nervous about competing with some of the world’s biggest wrestling giants at the Games, but also looking forward to it. “Sakshi Malik used to say victory and loss are not important - just trust your hard work. That’s what I will do,” she adds. As she gets ready for training, a picture of Sakshi posing with her Olympic medal, beams down at her. “My only focus now is to win a medal” she says. “Who knows, maybe one day I will have my picture next to hers.”",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58grz0020o,"Divya Arya,",2024-07-08 23:11:35,

210,This Nato summit could save or sink Biden's candidacy,"It is a week of reckoning for Joe Biden.  Twelve days after a halting debate performance that may go down as one of the most damaging in modern American history, the president is fighting for his political survival under intense domestic and global scrutiny. This week’s Nato summit in Washington DC may be his path to at least a temporary reprieve - or this president’s last stand. In the past few days, Mr Biden has railed against his critics, claimed the mandate of Democratic primary voters and challenged opponents to step forward and try to unseat him.  He has promised repeatedly that he is moving ahead with his campaign and that the time for second-guessing and hand-wringing is over. That pressing ahead will start at the Nato summit.  Mr Biden will host alliance leaders for three days of meetings and public events culminating in a solo press conference on Thursday afternoon.  It is a stage on which Mr Biden, a man well versed in foreign relations, should be comfortable. But it also raises the already high stakes for his presidency, given that a poor showing will have international as well as domestic ramifications. A mistake could start a political stampede among Democrats that extinguishes his hopes of even making it to the November general election, let alone winning it.  It could also sharpen concerns from European allies who are concerned about the increasing likelihood of a Donald Trump presidency and the dramatic foreign policy shifts that would come with it. “Biden is entering this week diminished,” said Kristine Berzina, managing director of the German Marshall Fund Geostrategy North.  “We don’t know how he’s going to exit it.” It is understood that many European leaders are anxious about Trump and his foreign policy strategy. The former president has disparaged multilateral international alliances. Ms Berzina said that in the past two weeks, however, these leaders have been experiencing something new - Biden anxiety. After his halting debate performance, she says, American allies have begun doubting whether the president is up to the task.  Heading into the Nato summit, they are hoping to see some evidence that his performance that night was an aberration and not reflective of a new normal.  “It is worrisome to have a close ally, your most meaningful ally, falter,” said Ms Berzina.  “So I think there is tremendous hope that Biden passes the test. But if he isn’t able to deliver, it creates more questions about the US’s reliability.” Eyes will be on the US president as he attends summit sessions, hosts foreign leaders at the White House and engages in bilateral meetings with key leaders, including newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Even behind closed doors of the Nato meetings, word of Mr Biden’s performance - good or bad - is sure to leak out. Mr Biden faces an even taller task this week domestically. The president has pointed to buttressing and expanding Nato in the face of Russian aggression as one of his key accomplishments.  This is something that differentiates his leadership from Trump’s - as well as any Democrats who could potentially replace him on the ballot - and the summit will be his chance to put that on display for the American public. “Who’s going to be able to keep Nato together like me?” the president said in his interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on Friday. He added that the Nato summit would be a good way to judge his abilities. “Come listen,” he said. “See what they say.” But simply clearing low expectations at the Nato summit and the Thursday press conference may not be enough for many of the politicians, pundits and party activists who are already calling for him to step aside. “Just having some good appearances is not going to stop the questions,” said Bill Scher, a liberal pundit and editor of Washington Monthly who recently penned a column calling for Mr Biden to step aside for Vice-President Kamala Harris.  “Time was really of the essence to nip all the speculation in the bud, and they wasted a week. There is no clear path out of this situation.” Mr Scher - a longtime supporter of Mr Biden - says the president’s attempts to push back now with media interviews, letters and calls to Democratic politicians come after public sentiment has solidified against him.  And once that sentiment is fully cemented in the polls - which could take several weeks - it will probably be too late to cleanly replace him. “I understand how difficult it has to be when you’re nearing the end of your life and you’re not performing as well as you used to,” Mr Scher said. “Having to come to terms with that in public has to be excruciating.” But the data that shows Mr Biden losing support and facing defeat in November is becoming increasingly clear.  Polls indicate nearly three-quarters of Americans - and even a majority of Democrats - think the president should stand down. A half-dozen Democratic members of Congress have called for him to abandon his bid, and many others have offered only equivocal support. The president continues to say he will press ahead with his campaign, however, and he has the national convention delegates to ensure that he is the Democratic nominee. The decision lies firmly in his hands, and if he can make it through the week without a major misstep, he may, in fact, survive the immediate storm. The story of this week, however, has been set. It isn’t one of Nato celebrating its 75th year of existence and focusing on the challenges to come.  Instead, it is a narrative that could decide whether Mr Biden can politically live to fight another day.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0471nye4lko,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-09 07:11:35,
209,Kyiv hospital boss describes 'real hell' of missile attack,"The director of Ukraine's largest children's hospital, hit on Monday by a deadly missile strike blamed on Russia, has said the attack was ""real hell"". ""Children and adults screamed in fear, wounded from pain"" in Kyiv's Ohmadyt hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir told the UN Security Council on Tuesday. He said more than 1,200 patients and personnel were in the hospital at the time and three heart surgeries were being carried out. Two adults were killed and more than 300 people injured, including children, he added. On Tuesday, Ukraine published photos of what it said were recovered fragments of a Russian cruise missile that hit the hospital in the capital. Russia claimed the blast was caused by a misfiring Ukrainian air defence missile, but the UN said it was highly likely Moscow was behind the attack - a conclusion shared by analysts who spoke to BBC Verify. The attack was globally condemned, with US President Joe Biden saying it was a ""horrific reminder of Russia's brutality"".  Mr Biden, who is hosting a Nato summit in Washington on Tuesday, also vowed to strengthen Kyiv's air defences. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is attending the summit, said: ""We are fighting for more air defence systems for Ukraine... We are fighting for more planes."" At least 46 people - including 33 in Kyiv - were killed across Ukraine in a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes on Monday, local officials said.

212,Modi's balancing act as he meets Putin in Moscow,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being keenly watched by his Western allies as he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on his first foreign trip since he returned to office for a third term in June. Mr Modi landed on Monday, just hours after Russian bombing killed at least 41 people in Ukraine, including at a children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking a global outcry. Photos from Moscow showed a beaming Mr Modi hugging the Russian president. A video of a smiling Mr Putin calling Mr Modi ""my dearest friend"" and telling him that he was ""delighted to see him"" has gone viral in India.  Mr Modi's two-day visit - his first to the Kremlin since 2019 - coincides with a Nato summit in Washington, where the 2022 invasion will be a major theme. India, a key global economy, has close ties with both Russia and the US and its partners and officials in Delhi are playing down questions over the timing of Mr Modi's trip. They say the annual summit is part of a long-standing strategic partnership and its scheduling has nothing to do with the Nato summit. But a sour note has been struck with the US expressing concern. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller urged Mr Modi to emphasise Ukraine's territorial integrity during his talks in Moscow.  Mr Miller also said the US had raised concerns with India regarding its relationship with Russia. ""We would urge India, as we do any country when it engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN charter, that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty,"" he said at a press briefing on Monday.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky went further - and did not mince his words. ""It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,"" he posted on X (formerly Twitter) late on Monday. Mr Modi told President Putin that India was ready to offer any assistance in establishing peace in Ukraine. Russian state TV quoted him saying that war was ""not a solution"".  He also said the death of children was painful and terrifying, a day after the deadly attack on the Kyiv children's hospital. ""Whether it is war, conflict or a terrorist attack, any person who believes in humanity, is pained when there is loss of lives,"" Mr Modi said. ""But even in that, when innocent children are killed, the heart bleeds and that pain is very terrifying."" The Nato summit in Washington, which begins on Tuesday, is being held to mark the 75th anniversary of the Western defence grouping which was mainly formed as a bulwark against the then Soviet Union after World War Two. Nato countries have been vehemently opposed to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, while India and Mr Modi have refrained from any explicit criticism of President Putin except calling for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. As Western nations try to isolate Moscow by imposing sanctions, President Putin has been having summit-level meetings with leaders of key nations like China, India, Turkey and others. Some are now asking whether Mr Modi's presence in Moscow could be to Mr Putin's advantage. Is the message India is sending out playing into the hands of Russia? “The bilateral visit this time is just a scheduling priority that we have undertaken. And that’s what it is,” Vinay Kwatra, permanent secretary to the Indian foreign ministry, told the BBC ahead of Mr Modi’s visit, rejecting any connection between the two events. India and Russia share close defence and strategic relations from Cold War days and Moscow remains a key supplier of weapons. India, which maintains one of the largest militaries in the world, has long-standing border disputes with its neighbours Pakistan and China. Experts say Mr Modi giving importance to Moscow is not a surprise and the relationship goes beyond defence procurement. “If you look at the historical trend, it [Moscow] has been one of the constants in Indian foreign policy,” Pankaj Saran, former Indian ambassador to Moscow, told the BBC. “The main pillars of the relationship include defence co-operation, energy and science technology.” Over the years, Russia has provided technical assistance to build several nuclear power plants in India.  Since the Ukraine war began, Delhi has also been buying billions of dollars of discounted oil from Moscow after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia to limit what it could sell or charge for the product. Driven by a surge in the purchase of oil, bilateral trade between India and Russia in the last few years has soared to $65bn (£50.76bn). India’s exports to Russia stand at just $4bn. Indian officials say a key priority for Mr Modi will be to address this trade imbalance and encourage Russian investment in India as well as moving some defence production to India. For the past 20 years, the West, particularly the US, has cultivated closer ties with India in what many see as a bulwark against the threat posed by an increasingly assertive China. India also became a member of the Quad - a strategic forum with the US, Australia and Japan - which is seen as a grouping aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Asia Pacific. But faced with increasing Western hostility, President Putin has developed closer strategic and economic ties with Beijing. The development has not gone unnoticed in India, China's long-time rival. A deadly brawl on the disputed border in Ladakh region in June 2020 killed 20 Indian and at least four Chinese soldiers and escalated tensions. There are apprehensions in India that it may be left out of the Moscow-Beijing equation. “One option currently being exercised by Delhi is to keep the Russia channel open to maintain the friendship and avoid taking any measures which may further aggravate Russia’s drift into Chinese arms that is being caused by US and Western policies,” says Mr Saran. Though Delhi has diversified its weapons inventory in recent decades by buying American, French and Israeli arms systems, it still relies heavily on Moscow and there have been concerns the war in Ukraine has had an impact on its defence exports. “There are reports of delays in the supplies of some spare parts and the delivery of the remaining S-400 anti-missile defence system. So, there will definitely be some discussion on this during the visit,” says Anil Trigunayat, a former ambassador and now a Distinguished Fellow at the Vivekananda International Foundation in Delhi. Delhi and Moscow are not without their own differences. There have been several reported cases of Indian nationals who were lured with false promises of lucrative job offers and ended up fighting for the Russian army in Ukraine. Four Indians have died so far in the fighting. Indian officials insist that during this visit, Mr Modi will press his Russian counterparts for an early discharge of Indians - thought to number in the dozens - still fighting in the war. India is aware that it needs both the United States and Russia to counter its rival China. Hence, it feels the need to strike a balance not to offend either of the two.  “India follows a policy of strategic autonomy and multi-alignments. We have strategic relationships with both the US and Russia. These are mutually exclusive partnerships,” says Mr Trigunayat.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd91pe5r9go,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-09 13:11:35,
225,Brazil's Bolsonaro may be charged over jewel sale,"Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro benefited from an illegal scheme to sell $1.2m (£937,000) in jewellery and other luxury gifts given to his government, police investigators say. It comes after Brazil's Federal Police last week recommended charging him with crimes including money-laundering over undeclared jewellery gifted between 2019 and 2022. The latest police report states that officials had ""acted to divert"" expensive gifts to Mr Bolsonaro from foreign governments. The officials then sought to sell the items for ""the illicit enrichment of the then president"".  The far-right politician has claimed that cases against him are politically motivated.  The report submitted to the Supreme Federal Court on Monday says that cash raised from such sales was paid to the former president ""without using the formal banking system"". Prosecutors have been given 15 days to decide whether to formally charge Mr Bolsonaro. The case centres on allegations that he tried to illegally import and keep millions of dollars' worth of jewellery given to him and his wife by Saudi Arabia in 2019. The jewels were impounded by Brazilian customs officials when a member of Mr Bolsonaro's entourage tried to bring them into the country in 2021. The police report says the jewellery included Rolex watches and Patek Phillipe watches, as well as diamond pieces from luxury brand Chopard. Mr Bolsonaro's team later returned some of the jewellery once news of the case was reported, it added. The former president's lawyer, Paulo Cunha, posted on social media that heads of state ""have no direct or indirect influence"" on what happens to official gifts. Mr Bolsonaro is also facing other legal challenges, including an investigation into whether he incited rioters who stormed key government buildings after he narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. This led to unsubstantiated claims by his supporters of voting fraud - eventually escalating into the violent scenes in the capital. He has voiced ""regret"" for the unrest, but denies he caused it. However, Brazil's Supreme Court has agreed to include him in its investigation into the storming of government buildings on 8 January 2023.

224,Anchorman and Bob's Burgers actor pleads guilty over Jan 6,"Comedian Jay Johnston, known for his roles in Anchorman and Bob's Burgers, has pleaded guilty over his involvement in the 6 January US Capitol riot. Mr Johnston admitted on Monday to a single count of obstructing officers during a civil disorder. He will be sentenced in October and faces up to five years in federal prison. More than 540 Capitol riot participants have served time behind bars. Mr Johnston, 55, has acting credits in Hollywood going back to the mid-1990s. He acted and wrote for all four seasons of HBO's Mr Show with Bob and David, starred in all three seasons of Comedy Central's The Sarah Silverman Program, and had a recurring role on the Fox sitcom Arrested Development. Among the other films in which the Illinois native has starred are Men in Black II. Internet sleuths identified him as a participant in the 6 January riot from a social media post by the FBI in March 2021. Authorities have said he ""participated with other rioters in a group assault"" on police officers protecting a Capitol entrance and ""helped carry a stolen police riot shield out"". According to court documents, Mr Johnson also admitted to an acquaintance by text message that he had been there. “The news has presented it as an attack. It actually wasn’t,"" he wrote.  ""Thought it kind of turned into that. It was a mess. Got maced and tear gassed and I found it quite untastic.” That December, amid the allegations, Mr Johnston was fired from his role on animated series Bob's Burgers. He voiced fan-favourite character Italian restaurateur Jimmy Pesto. The character was recast in 2023 and returned to the show for its latest season. Mr Johnston was arrested in California last summer and initially charged on four counts. His plea agreement saw him admit to a single civil disorder charge while the other three offences were dropped. His sentencing hearing is set for 7 October. Nearly 1,500 people have been charged over their role in the violence that unfolded in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, according to the justice department. Of those individuals, more than 800 have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from assaulting law enforcement to seditious conspiracy.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yqv84x4ko,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-08 23:11:36,
223,South Korea politician blames women for rising male suicides,"A politician in South Korea is being criticised for making dangerous and unsubstantiated comments after linking a rise in male suicides to the increasingly “dominant” role of women in society. In a report, Seoul City councillor Kim Ki-duck argued women’s increased participation in the workforce over the years had made it harder for men to get jobs and to find women who wanted to marry them. He said the country had recently “begun to change into a female-dominant society” and that this might ""partly be responsible for an increase in male suicide attempts”. South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among the world’s rich countries but also has one of the worst records on gender equality. Councillor Kim’s comments have been criticised as the latest in a series of out-of-touch remarks made by male politicians. Councillor Kim, from the Democratic Party, arrived at his assessment when analysing data on the number of suicide attempts made at bridges along Seoul’s Han river. The report, published on the city council’s official website, showed that the number of suicide attempts along the river had risen from 430 in 2018 to 1,035 in 2023, and of those trying to take their lives the proportion who were men had climbed from 67% to 77%. Suicide prevention experts have expressed concern over Mr Kim’s report. “It is dangerous and unwise to make claims like this without sufficient evidence,” Song Han, a mental health professor at Seoul’s Yonsei University, told the BBC. He pointed out that globally more men took their lives than women. In many countries, including the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50. Even so, Prof Song said the reasons behind the sharp rise in men attempting suicide in Seoul needed to be scientifically studied, adding it was “very regrettable” that the councillor had made it about gender conflict.  In South Korea there is a substantial gulf between the number of men and women in full-time employment, with women disproportionately working temporary or part-time jobs. The gender pay gap is slowly narrowing, but still women are paid on average 29% less than men. In recent years an anti-feminist movement has surged, led by disillusioned young men, who argue they have been disadvantaged by attempts to improve women’s lives. Appearing to echo such views, Councillor Kim’s report concluded that the way to overcome “the female-domination phenomenon” was to improve people’s awareness of gender equality so that “men and women can enjoy equal opportunities”. Koreans took to the social media platform X to denounce the councillor’s remarks as “unsubstantiated” and “misogynistic”, with one user questioning whether they were living in a parallel universe. The Justice Party accused the councillor of “easily shifting the blame to women in Korean society who are struggling to escape gender discrimination"". It has called on him to retract his remarks and instead “properly analyse” the causes of the problem. When approached for comment by the BBC, Councillor Kim said he had “not intended to be critical of the female-dominated society”, and was merely giving his personal view about some of its consequences. However, his comments follow a number of unscientific and sometimes bizarre political proposals aimed at tackling some of South Korea’s most pressing social issues, including mental illness, gender violence and the lowest birth rate in the world. Last month, another Seoul councillor in his 60s published a series of articles on the authority’s website encouraging young women to take up gymnastics and practise pelvic floor exercises in order to raise the birth rate. At the same time, a government think tank recommended that girls start school earlier than boys, so that classmates would be more attracted to each other by the time they were ready to marry. “Such comments encapsulate just how pervasive misogyny is in South Korea,” said Yuri Kim, director of the Korean Women's Trade Union. She accused politicians and policymakers of not even trying to understand the challenges women faced, preferring to scapegoat them instead. “Blaming women for entering the workforce will only prolong the imbalances in our society,” she told the BBC. Currently women account for 20% of South Korea’s members of parliament, and 29% of all local councillors. Seoul City Council told the BBC there was no process in place to vet what politicians published on its official website unless the content was illegal. It said individuals were solely responsible for their content and would face any consequences at the next election.

222,Hamas critic beaten by masked men in Gaza,"A Palestinian activist known for organising anti-Hamas protests in Gaza has been taken to hospital after an attack by a group of masked men. Amin Abed, 35, was admitted in critical condition after being kidnapped near his home by five assailants on Monday afternoon. A well-known activist, Mr Abed told the BBC: “I will not stop using my right to express my rejection of the 7 October attack."" Public dissent against Hamas has grown in recent months as residents of Gaza grow angry at the huge toll inflicted on the enclave since the start of the war.  More than 38,240 people have been killed, including 50 in the past day, in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began its offensive following Hamas's unprecedented 7 October attack. Mr Abed described being kidnapped near his house by a group of five men who were armed with guns and machetes.  He was taken to a semi-demolished house, beaten, and called ""an agent for Israel"" and ""a traitor"".  The leader of the group told Mr Abed's assailants to break his fingers so he could not again write criticism of Hamas or ""the heroic events of 7 October"".  After a group of passers-by attempted to intervene, the attackers fired shots into the air and told them to stay away, claiming they were from Hamas security forces. Eventually, the assailants left and bystanders were able to take Mr Abed to a hospital.  Mr Abed is considered a popular figure. Before the war, had been arrested multiple times for speaking out against Hamas rule. On Monday morning, Mr Abed wrote a long criticism of Hamas on Facebook, accusing the group of “dividing the Palestinian people” and “quashing their dream of a state”. “We are tired, world,” he wrote, “we are really tired.” Last week, in an interview with the BBC, he said: “[Hamas] has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Days earlier, he criticised Hamas in an interview with Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya. A  clip from the interview was picked up on TikTok. In 2019, Mr Abed helped organise protests over the state of Gaza’s economy. Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank and political rival of Hamas, released a statement on Monday condemning “the blatant assault on activist Amin Abed in Gaza”. It did not name Hamas, but said the ""de facto authorities in Gaza"" had allowed ""criminality"" to spread in the enclave and held them fully responsible for Abed's well-being. Hamas violently ousted Fatah from the Gaza Strip in 2007, a year after winning national elections, reinforcing its power there and deepening a schism between the two dominant Palestinian groups. Gaza’s Hamas-run police force has largely disappeared from the streets since the start of the war because of being targeted in Israeli air strikes, though the group remains the official authority in the territory. The BBC has approached Hamas for comment. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to its attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82xx9pj5do,"Tom Bennett,",2024-07-09 16:11:36,
220,Mummified body of missing US climber found after 22 years,"The mummified remains of an American man have been found 22 years after he went missing while climbing a mountain in Peru. William Stampfl, 59, was reported missing in June 2002 after an avalanche buried his climbing party while scaling Mount Huascarán, Peru's highest peak. Peruvian police said ice melt had exposed Stampfl's mummified and clothed body. He was identified by the passport found among his belongings. Police said Stampfl's body was well-preserved by the Peruvian ice, with his clothes in good condition, the AFP reported. He was still wearing his boots and harness. Mount Huascarán, which is situated about 270 miles (435km) north of the capital Lima, stands at more than 22,000ft (6,706m). With its snowy peaks and stunning climbs, the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in north-eastern Peru is a magnet for mountaineers worldwide. Stampfl embarked with two others - Steve Erskine and Matthew Richardson - on a 19-day round trip from California to Peru's tallest summit. But an avalanche upended their climb on 24 June 2002. Only Erskine's body had previously been found.  Stampfl is at least the third person this year found dead in the region. The body of an Italian climber who fell while scaling another peak was recovered last month, while an Israeli man was found dead in May nearly a month after his disappearance. Last month, five bodies were found frozen in ice on the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest. Glaciers are melting and receding around the world, which most scientists attribute to accelerating climate change.

219,Prosecutors probe Marine Le Pen campaign funding,"An investigation has been opened into the financing of French far right National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen's 2022 presidential campaign. Prosecutors in Paris said they will look into allegations of embezzlement, forgery and fraud, and that a candidate on an electoral campaign accepted a loan. The investigation was opened a week ago following a 2023 report by the National Commission on Campaign Accounts and Political Financing (CNCCFP). The commission's role is to scrutinise candidates' election expenses and funding and to flag any issues that arise.  No more details have been given on the reasons for the inquiry, nor has Ms Le Pen's camp commented. The RN has previously received loans from Russian and Hungarian banks. The Russian loan worth €9.4m (£7.9m), however, was all paid back last year.  In 2017, the RN was charged with giving party members suspected fake jobs as assistants at the European Parliament.  About €5m (£4m) allegedly went to RN assistants who were not working for MEPs, but doing party work in France. The RN denied the charges and said it would prove it did not embezzle cash.  A court will judge Ms Le Pen and 24 other members of her party over the alleged misuse of EU funds in September. A veteran of French politics, Ms Le Pen ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022.  She was re-elected to parliament during the first round of France's snap parliamentary election last month. Her party unexpectedly came third, despite having achieved a decisive victory in the European Parliament elections just weeks before.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnk4qlwn7dpo,"Laura Gozzi,",2024-07-09 12:11:36,
218,Camila Cabello: I need to treat myself with kindness,"""I have a very naïve attitude before I put music out,"" says Camila Cabello. ""I think because I love it so much and I think it’s good, everybody’s going to love it."" Camila's just released her fourth studio album C,XOXO. As someone who's been in the public eye since she was 15, it's not exactly a first for her. But she tells BBC Newsbeat that the more experimental sound of her latest meant she felt ""a little bit more nervous"" than usual. Camila started out as a member of girl group Fifth Harmony before going solo and finding success with a Latin-influenced pop sound. Her best-known tracks, Havana and Señorita, have had billions of plays on Spotify. So C,XOXO was a potentially risky departure for the 27-year-old, but it's one that's led to collabs with rappers Drake, Lil Nas X and Playboi Carti. ""It’s a testament to 'what’s the worst that can happen?',"" says Camila. ""And I had that energy throughout this album."" Camila's also been braver recently when it comes to speaking about her mental health and living with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. She says it's a ""complicated"" subject she can be ""hesitant to talk about"", especially around taking medication and the stigma that can come with it. Camila says she feels privileged to have had access to ""things that have made my life a lot easier"", such as tools, therapy, and medication. But at times, particularly in her early 20s, Camila says she's felt guilty for not feeling great despite being a globally famous pop singer.  ""One of my favourite things about getting older and experiencing life is this persistent sense of irony,"" she says.  ""Where what you see a lot of time is not the reality."" ""I think it just goes to show you how complex we are and how complicated we are as humans that it's not really black and white."" Camila says she still has bad days but practising ""self-compassion"" has helped her. ""I think it's really treating yourself with kindness and love,"" she says. ""The more empathy, less judgement and the more compassion you have for yourself, and for your own difficult emotions, the more that you'll have that empathy and space for other people."" Camila was born in Havana to a Cuban mum and Mexican dad, and moved between both countries until she was six, when the family settled in Miami, Florida. She says talking openly about how she was feeling didn't always come naturally. ""Latin families - or immigrant families - don’t a lot of the time have the bandwidth for realising what their mental health is,"" she says. ""They’re so focused on survival and it’s just not on their radar. ""That was a big part, probably in the beginning for me, the confusion of my own guilt and shame of 'I should be great'."" Family is an important pillar in Camila’s life. Her previous album, Familia, written during the Covid pandemic, explored her Latin roots and how her family inspired her work ethic. She says that's filtered into making C,XOXO. ""My mum is the definition of so hard-working,"" says Camila.  ""If I’m working, she’s like working,"" she says. She says her mum, like lots of ""immigrant parents"", is constantly ""trying to improve and create"". ""They just have that kind of hustle mentality. And I really had to have that for this album."" Camila says she and her team spent 10 days in the Bahamas recording the album, and ""barely saw the sunlight because we were in the studio the whole time"". ""Anytime you are trying to make something great, it’s insanely hard,"" she says. ""I remember just being so frustrated and was exhausted."" But some things came a bit easier. Getting Drake involved simply ""started with a DM"", and wasn’t actually a request to ""do a song"" at first. ""At that time, I really genuinely was looking for friendship and connections with other artists in the music industry, because I had been such a hermit for so long,"" Camila says. ""I just felt like kind of antisocial. ""This album, I kind of spread my wings a little bit more."" When Camila speaks to Newsbeat it's just after her Glastonbury appearance, and she's just woken up from a nap with her mum. She says she's ""still recovering"" from her Other Stage set ""and pretty sure I’m getting sick"". But once she's feeling better, Camila says she wants to spread those wings even further, and ""just wants to have shows in the UK"". ""They were so loud and everyone was so kind. I felt welcomed,"" she says. ""I love the Brits and the Brits love me.""

221,$1bn gift pays tuition for most at Johns Hopkins med school,"Many current and future medical students at Johns Hopkins University found out on Monday that their tuition will soon be free.  Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and business leader, has given $1bn (£780m) to cover tuition for students whose parents earn less than $300,000 a year. Those whose parents bring in less than $175,000 will also have their living expenses paid. The move affects around two-thirds of current and prospective medical students at Johns Hopkins, which is based in Maryland. “As the US struggles to recover from a disturbing decline in life expectancy, our country faces a serious shortage of doctors, nurses, and public health professionals,"" Mr Bloomberg, said. ""And yet, the high cost of medical, nursing, and graduate school too often bars students from enrolling.""  The latest medical school graduates from Johns Hopkins had an average student loan debt exceeding $100,000, the school said.  Mr Bloomberg's gift, made through his philanthropic organisation, will also increase financial aid available for students in other programmes, including graduate students in public health and nursing, education, engineering and others.  The university's president, Ron Daniels, said that “removing financial barriers to individual opportunity fuels excellence, innovation and discoveries that redound to the benefit of society"". This is not Mr Bloomberg's first large contribution to the university, which is also his alma mater.  In 2018, Bloomberg Philanthropies made a $1.8bn donation to remove financial barriers for undergraduate students. His latest donation follows Kenneth Langone and his wife, Elaine's $200m donation to the NYU Long Island School of Medicine in 2023, which made tuition free for all medical students.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldyn779309o,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-09 15:11:36,

Southgate said his team - who won one and drew two of their group stage games before narrowly beating Slovakia and then edging past Switzerland on penalties in the knock-outs - ""couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place"". ""One of our strengths over the years has been having less fear, showing less inhibition,"" he said.  ""But at the beginning of the tournament the expectation weighed heavily and the noise from outside had never been louder."" Captain Harry Kane said the team ""use past experiences to help"" when they approach ""tough"" games like Wednesday's semi-final (20:00 BST). ""I just think during the game you lean on experience, the leaders who have been there and done that,"" Kane said. ""Ultimately it's about going out there and taking the opportunity with both hands. ""Reaching back-to-back European Championship finals would be an amazing achievement and we have the opportunity to go and do that."" The winners of Wednesday's semi-final will play Spain on Sunday after their 2-1 win over France on Tuesday.

While Kane conceded that ""as we've been getting better the expectation gets higher"", he said the added pressure can sometimes give players a boost.  He added: ""Some will use it in different ways, some will use it as motivation, some will just block it out and focus on what they need to do. Everyone's different. ""From a team point of view we know what we need to achieve. We have a really important game, a really tough game we need to be ready for. We've prepared for that.""

""The game will take us in a certain direction that will make that decision for us."" Defender Luke Shaw made his first appearance from the bench in the win against Switzerland after returning from injury, but Southgate did not shed any more light on whether he will start Wednesday's game. The manager said they ""have to decide"" if Shaw, who had been injured for four months, is ""ready to start"". Southgate also dismissed concerns over a German referee once criticised over his match-fixing past by Jude Bellingham officiating the game. Bellingham, then playing for Borussia Dortmund,  was fined 40,000 euros (£34,000) in 2021 for referencing Felix Zwayer's previous six-month ban for match fixing. Southgate added: ""I have no concerns about who the referee is, he will be at a very high standard because that is how Uefa make those decisions.

226,Philipsen powers to Tour de France stage 10 win,"Jasper Philipsen has now won seven stages overall at the Tour de France Belgium's Jasper Philipsen powered to victory in a sprint finish on stage 10 of the Tour de France as Tadej Pogacar retained the leader's yellow jersey. Philipsen, who was led out superbly by his Alpecin-Deceuninck team-mate, world champion Mathieu van der Poel, comfortably held off Eritrea's Biniam Girmay and Germany's Pascal Ackermann, who finished second and third.  Slovenia's Pogacar finished safely in the main bunch, as the threat of crosswinds and echelons failed to materialise on an uneventful 187.3km run from Orleans to Saint-Amand-Montrond. The UAE-Team Emirates rider leads Remco Evenepoel of Soudal-Quick Step by 33 seconds, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Visma-Lease a Bike in third, one minute 15 seconds further back in the general classification. Philipsen was the dominant sprinter 12 months ago, claiming victories in four of the first 11 stages at La Grande Boucle. But until now it had been a largely frustrating Tour for the 26-year-old this year.  A crash on stage three left many riders - including Philipsen - out of position and he was pipped to the line as Mark Cavendish claimed his record 35th stage win two days later in Saint-Vulbas.  A demotion from second to 107th came on stage six after he deviated from his sprinting line - almost colliding with Wout van Aert - and he was unable to match Girmay on stage eight in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. However, with Van der Poel expertly providing assistance, Philipsen finally secured a stage win as he narrowed the gap to Girmay from 96 points to 74 in the race for the green jersey. ""We had some bad luck. I am really happy - it is a big relief. We can finally show our strength, with our lead-out train and did finally what we came for,"" he said. ""Mathieu is a really strong guy. When he can show his power and play his part, there aren't many riders who can emulate him. Having the world champion as your lead-out guy is fantastic.""

After the game was reduced to nine overs a side because of a two-hour rain delay,  Alice Capsey hit 28 from just 15 balls to help England reach 89-6. New Zealand slumped to 42-5 in reply when a further spell of heavy rain brought an early end to the contest.

A break in the weather finally allowed play to begin, albeit in damp and muggy conditions. Danni Wyatt, who hit a match-winning 76 in the first T20 at Southampton on Saturday, fell for a three-ball duck as New Zealand made a good start after winning the toss. But England responded aggressively, with fellow opener Maia Bouchier hitting a rapid 23, while Capsey's spritely innings included two fours and two sixes.  The biggest shot of the day though went to Nat Sciver-Brunt, whose huge booming six off Lea Tahuhu went out of the ground. New Zealand made a poor start to their reply, losing Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr in the powerplay to slip to 12-2. They never really recovered, with Dean removing Suzie Bates and Brooke Halliday in the same over to slip to 31-4.

Medvedev, who defeated world number one Jannik Sinner, will be looking to avenge his defeat in the 2023 last-four match that Alcaraz won in straight sets on his way to taking the title. Alcaraz was a set and a break of serve down on Court One on Tuesday against American Paul, the 12th seed, but recovered to win 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2 in a match that lasted three hours 11 minutes. Meanwhile, Medvedev had to fight every bit as hard as he defeated Sinner 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 6-3 win in four hours on Centre Court. Alcaraz has already won three Grand Slam titles at the age of 21, while Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, will be aiming to reach the Wimbledon final for the first time. ""Daniil's a really great player. It's the same semi-final as last year so hopefully I'm going to get the same result,"" said Alcaraz. ""He just won against Sinner, the best player right now, so he's in really good shape and I have to play my best. ""I have to believe in myself and try to keep going. It's going to be difficult but I'm going to enjoy it."" Spaniard Alcaraz is a keen football fan and had spoken of his desire to be able to watch Spain in their Euro 2024 semi-final against France later on Tuesday. The 21-year-old looked like he was in a rush to finish his match as he instantly piled on the pressure and took his sixth break-point opportunity to move 2-1 ahead. However, Paul, the champion at Queen’s Club last month, instantly got back on serve as a pulsating encounter full of breathtaking shots, power and commitment played out in front of an enthralled Court One crowd. The sixth game lasted more than 15 minutes, with Paul, in his first Wimbledon quarter-final, missing three chances of a break. But that did not prove costly. He was two points from the opening set in the 10th game, but got over the line two games later, finishing off a delightful passing shot which Alcaraz at full stretch could not reach. Paul took a 2-0 lead in the second set, but from then on Alcaraz recovered and stamped his authority thanks to his court coverage, ability to find spectacular winners and his impressive first serves. The opening three games of the third set saw neither player able to hold serve, but with Paul tiring and starting to produce unforced errors, Alcaraz pulled clear and sealed a superb victory. ""When I lost the first set it was difficult,” said Alcaraz. “But I knew it's a really long journey so I had to stay there. “If I'm struggling and the opponent is playing great tennis, I believe I'll be able to come back and find solutions - I believe in myself the whole time.""

Italian top seed Sinner, who was hampered by illness, had won his most recent five encounters against Medvedev - including January's Australian Open final.

'Djokovic loves the confrontation - and thrives off it' Wimbledon changes finals plan and confirms rain 'last resort' Qualifier Sun out as Vekic reaches first semi-final Medvedev is through to a second straight Wimbledon semi-final In their Australian Open title match, Sinner made an incredible comeback from two sets down to claim his maiden Grand Slam trophy. On Tuesday, the 22-year-old took an early lead when Medvedev cracked first in a tie-break - double-faulting on Sinner's second set point. However, Sinner started to appear unwell and struggled to maintain his intensity levels as Medvedev patiently rode out the second set after breaking early. Still out of sorts and after dropping serve early once again, Sinner called for a medical timeout in the third set, receiving attention before going off the court for almost 10 minutes. He returned with renewed energy and the support of the crowd, slowly working his way back. Sinner could not capitalise on two set points, though, as Medvedev held firm and came out on top in a tie-break to nudge ahead in the match. Former teenage prodigy Sinner raced through the fourth set to take the match into a decider - to the delight of the Centre Court crowd. But it was Medvedev who finished the stronger, breaking for a 3-1 lead before sealing victory with a backhand winner on his first match point.

230,"'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history","An initial version of this story was published on 15 June 2024 Imagine playing for your country in a major tournament aged 16. Lamine Yamal has done that - and more. The Barcelona star, who is already the youngest man to play at the European Championship, is now the youngest to score after curling in a sublime equaliser against France in Tuesday's semi-final. Spain went on to reach Sunday's final, after Dani Olmo's first-half strike sealed victory, with Yamal turning 17 the day before the Berlin showpiece. The tricky winger - full name Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana - has already played 51 times for Barcelona, scoring seven goals, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to see Yamal mixing it with the very best. Those who know him best certainly aren't. This video can not be played Yamal scores 'unbelievable' equaliser for Spain An outrageously precocious talent, Yamal will turn 17 on 13 July, the day before the final. The previous youngest player at the Euros was Poland's Kacper Kozlowski - 17 years and 246 days - in a 1-1 group-stage draw against Spain in Seville in June 2021, but you get the feeling Yamal could break a few more records in the coming days. “He will do things we cannot yet imagine,” says Ivan Carrasco, who trained him at junior level. “I remember him as a boy who was very aware of his talent. In sport, talented people tend to be very selfish, but not Yamal. “I saw a generous child who did not seek recognition. As a coach you sometimes thought, 'what can I teach him if he does things that I can't even imagine from the bench?' “The closer you are to Lamine, the more you realise that the label of ‘decisive’ falls short. He is a very, very special footballer."" Former Barcelona reporter and current Sport TV journalist Jaume Marcet remembers the day he knew he was watching a prodigy. Marcet, who is an expert of Barcelona grassroots football, said: ""The most brutal display I have seen in grassroots football was from Lamine in the final of the Catalunya cadet tournament. ""I had seen Messi perform brutally, but never something like what Lamine did that match, with kids older than him. That day he did everything.""  This video can not be played 'The next superstar' - pundits praise Yamal Yamal's trademark 304 celebration is formed by angling three fingers on his right hand, forming a '0' with his thumb and forefinger, and angling four fingers on his left hand. It is a homage to the neighbourhood where he was raised, Rocafonda 304, an area of Barcelona rarely seen by the millions of tourists who flock to Catalonia's capital and one of the most deprived zones, not just in Catalonia but in the whole of the Spain. The son of a mother from Equatorial Guinea and a father from Morocco, after being spotted by Barcelona as a seven-year-old playing in the concrete parks in Rocafonda, his father took him by the hand into Barcelona, where he asked: ""Do you want my son to play for Barcelona?"" When they said ""yes"", he replied: ""Well, educate him first."" Yamal moved into Barcelona's La Masia academy, despite the close proximity of where he lived. In an interview with Sport, Xavi Martin, former director of La Masia, remembers the meeting with the player, his parents and the agent at the time, Ivan de la Pena, so that the boy could live in La Masia. ""We met on a Tuesday and on Saturday he was already packing his bags,"" he said.  Yamal's success is not just his, but that of an entire area until now ignored, decried, demeaned. He is a beacon of hope for people who see in his success that dreams can come true, that anything is possible. Yamal fell in love with football watching his father and older cousin play in the park opposite where he lived and where he would be spotted. ""I spent more time at the park than at home. Every time I set foot in the street it was to play football. These experiences stay with you,"" he said. The records just keep tumbling. He is the youngest to have played for Barcelona - at 15 years and 290 days - since 15-year-old Armando Sagi in 1922.  At the age of 16 years and 57 days, he became the youngest player and goalscorer for Spain.  Yamal's talent has also not gone unnoticed by the very person whom many people are daring to compare him too - Lionel Messi. In a WhatsApp message to one of his entourage, the Argentine maestro commented: ""How easy does Lamine make it look?"" Messi has already mentioned Yamal when he was asked about the players who will fight for the Ballon d'Or in the coming years. The player himself is realistic. ""There will never be another like Messi,"" Yamal has replied to the countless comparisons between him and the Barcelona legend. He may be right, but these days there is a huge banner that can be seen at Barcelona home games with a picture of Yamal doing the 304 sign and a logo that states ""El futuro no espera"" (The future won't wait).

232,Biden's bruising day sinks hopes Democrats will move on,"The most devastating argument against Joe Biden’s re-election bid may have come not from a politician or a pundit, but from a film star. But George Clooney, with his stinging New York Times opinion piece, isn’t the only one speaking out. A growing chorus from Democrats is sinking the president’s hopes of steadying his campaign this week – and perhaps ever. Just when it appeared he had turned a corner, with the influential Congressional Black Caucus and key liberal members of Congress voicing their support for him, the ground has shifted once again – and all in the midst of a high-profile Nato summit with US allies here in Washington. Now the stakes for Mr Biden’s press conference at the end of the Nato summit tomorrow afternoon are even higher. It will be the biggest unscripted test for him since his botched debate two weeks prior which triggered this crisis. Mr Biden also has a sit-down interview scheduled with NBC News presenter Lester Holt on Monday. A fumble or misstep in the days ahead could buttress all the most damaging assertions Mr Clooney, a top Democratic fundraiser, makes in his New York Times piece.  The actor writes that the president's decline is not an illusion; it’s real. He points to a Los Angeles fundraiser he threw for the president last month. “The Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe... of 2010,” he writes. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” The president is not up to the task of beating Donald Trump in November, Clooney continues. He calls the Biden campaign’s claim that he is the choice of Democratic primary voters “disingenuous, at best”. And, perhaps most devastating, he says every prominent Democrat he has spoken with knows all this – whether they’re willing to publicly admit it or not. “We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November"", he writes, “or we can speak the truth.” The Biden campaign is pushing back against the Clooney piece, noting that the president had flown across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in Italy, to attend the star’s fundraiser.  Campaign officials also note that the president has had serious disagreements recently with the star and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, about his administration’s Gaza policy. The opinion piece, published three weeks after that Los Angeles fundraiser, could be viewed like a strike timed for maximum effect. But Clooney isn’t just any movie star. He’s a powerful fundraiser for Democrats and has been for years. Given that California, and the Hollywood industry in particular, is a key part of the party’s money base, Clooney’s comments present a very real threat to Mr Biden.  It also comes on the heels of expressions of dissatisfaction from other big-money Democratic donors, such as Netflix chair Reed Hastings and IAC chair Barry Diller. The actor is also plugged in to party politics, with close ties to former President Barack Obama. It is difficult to imagine that he would have taken to the pages of the New York Times in such a dramatic way, with a double-barrel blast against the sitting president, without at least some tacit sign-off from prominent Democrats. And, increasingly, prominent Democrats are saying things that should give Mr Biden pause.  On Wednesday morning, hours before Clooney's opinion piece was published, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi - who still holds considerable influence within the party - stopped notably short of endorsing his bid for re-election. She said the president’s critics should hold their tongues until after this week’s Nato summit. “Whatever you're thinking,” she said, “you didn't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.” She added that Mr Biden should make a decision quickly about whether to continue his campaign. When prodded that the president had already clearly said he would stay in the race, she dodged. “I want him to do whatever he decides to do,” Mrs Pelosi said. And later in the day, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine – Hillary Clinton’s vice-presidential running mate in 2016 – offered similar lines, about how the president “will do the patriotic thing for the country” and “make that decision”. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, put it even more bluntly: “I’m fully behind him as our nominee until he’s not our nominee.” It’s as if Mr Biden’s tepid supporters simply won’t take “yes, I’m still running” as an answer. Meanwhile, even some of Mr Biden’s staunchest supporters have started to engage in “what if” scenarios. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he still backs the president, and would not run against Vice-President Kamala Harris as the nominee if Mr Biden stepped aside. Senate Democrats are meeting Biden campaign officials on Thursday to discuss the future of the campaign. And Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said he would speak to the president directly about Democratic concerns by Friday. Wheels are turning, but it's unclear whether they are grinding toward a resolution or spinning in place. If Mr Biden were to bow out, it’s still unclear what happens next. Some have suggested that Ms Harris, as the president’s running mate, is next in line. The solution, according to Clooney, is for Democrats to regroup and pick a new nominee, although he is vague about how the process could unfold. And his suggestion that, because of the shortened campaign season, whoever the party chooses would be able to avoid opposition research and negative campaigning – either from fellow Democrats or Republicans – seems naive in the extreme. While the mood in Washington has taken a new turn against the president in the past 24 hours, the mathematics of his situation has not changed. Mr Biden still controls the lion’s share of national convention delegates who ultimately decide the party’s presidential ticket. And while those delegates aren’t explicitly bound to support him, he could replace any who show insufficient loyalty. The opinion polls, while indicating he is trailing Trump, have not changed dramatically since his ill-fated debate. And few show any of the most obvious alternatives to him – the vice-president and prominent Democratic governors – doing substantially better. Even Mr Biden’s critics, with their appeals to his patriotism, sense of duty and concern for American democracy given the potential for a second Trump presidency, implicitly acknowledge that the decision ultimately lies with him. What Wednesday demonstrated, though, is that if he presses ahead, he may never be able to fully put the concerns about his age behind him. His debate performance may end up being a self-inflicted wound that never heals.",2024-07-10 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g07ng2mn1o,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-10 22:32:51,

246,Israel military tells Gaza City residents to leave,"The Israeli military has told all residents of Gaza City to evacuate south to the central Gaza Strip, amid intensified operations in the north.  Leaflets dropped by aircraft instruct ""everyone in Gaza City"" to leave what is described as a ""dangerous combat zone"" via designated safe routes - marked as two roads that lead to shelters in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida. The UN has said it is deeply concerned about the evacuation orders being given. It is the second time since the war began that Gaza City as a whole has been asked to evacuate. Over the past two weeks, Israeli forces have re-entered several districts where the military believes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters have regrouped since the start of the year. Hamas has said Israel’s renewed activity in the city is threatening to derail negotiations over a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal, which resumed on Wednesday in Qatar. The talks are being attended by the intelligence chiefs of Egypt, the US and Israel, as well as the prime minister of Qatar. Top Hamas official Hossam Badran told AFP that Israel ""is trying to pressure negotiations by intensifying bombing operations, displacement, and committing massacres"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised Israel’s commitment to a deal as long as Israel’s “red lines are preserved”. There are estimated to be more than a quarter-of-a-million people still living in Gaza City - and some were observed evacuating to the south. Others, though, were not willing to leave. ""I will not leave Gaza [City]. I will not make the stupid mistake that others have made. Israeli missiles do not differentiate between north and south,” resident Ibrahim al-Barbari, 47, told the BBC.  “If death is my fate and the fate of my children, we will die with honour and dignity in our homes,” he said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received calls from some residents who were unable to leave their homes because of the intensity of the bombing. ""The information coming from Gaza City shows residents are living through tragic conditions. [Israeli] occupation forces continue to hit residential districts, and displace people from their homes and refuge shelters,"" it said.  In a statement issued earlier on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had  ""conducted a counterterrorism operation"" overnight against Hamas and PIJ fighters who were operating inside a headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza City.  The troops had opened a “defined corridor to facilitate the evacuation of civilians” from the area before they entered the structure and “eliminated terrorists in close-quarters combat”, it added. There was no immediate comment from Unrwa. The IDF also said it had killed dozens of fighters in Gaza City's eastern Shejaiya district and dismantled an underground tunnel route over the past day.    Speaking in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that 60% of Hamas fighters had been killed or wounded since Israel’s offensive began. The BBC could not independently verify these figures. On Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Office said it was ""appalled"" by IDF orders for residents to evacuate to ""areas where Israeli military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured"". It also warned that the Deir al-Balah area was already seriously overcrowded with Palestinians displaced from other areas of Gaza and that there was little infrastructure and limited access to humanitarian assistance.  The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 38,295 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it had reportedly identified 14,680 children, women and elderly people among the dead by the end of April.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08nl4plvzo,"Tom Bennett and Rushdi Abualouf,",2024-07-10 17:09:52,
245,Top Democratic fundraiser Clooney calls on Biden to drop out,"George Clooney has issued a damning call for Joe Biden to quit the US presidential race, hours after senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi swerved questions about whether he should continue. The Hollywood actor and prominent Democratic fundraiser said that the president had won many battles in his career, ""but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time"". His comments came after Mrs Pelosi, the former House Speaker, joined growing disquiet in the party, saying that time was ""running short"" for Mr Biden, 81, to decide whether to stay in the race after his stumbling debate against Donald Trump. The president has stated, repeatedly, that he is determined to remain as the Democratic party's candidate and beat Trump, 78, in November.  Clooney wrote in the New York Times that it was ""devastating to say it"", but the Joe Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago was not the Biden of 2010. ""He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020,"" added the actor. ""He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,"" Clooney said.  The fundraising event, co-hosted by Clooney in Los Angeles and also featuring Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (£23m) for the Biden campaign.  The Biden camp has hit back at the Hollywood star, with an unnamed source telling US media: “The President stayed for over 3 hours [at the fundraiser], while Clooney took a photo quickly and left.” The president's campaign also pointed out that when he attended the fundraiser he had just arrived in Los Angeles from Italy, where he had been at the G7 summit. In his op-ed, Clooney said: ""Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw."" ""This is about age. Nothing more,"" he continued. ""We are not going to win in November with this president."" Clooney added that his concerns matched those of ""every"" member of Congress with whom he had spoken. Asked to respond, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was ""firmly committed"" to his candidacy and beating Trump. Yet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington. Mrs Pelosi, a highly influential voice among Capitol Hill Democrats, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to forge on. When asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: ""I want him to do whatever he decides to do.  ""It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short."" Acknowledging the demands on the president during the Nato summit, Mrs Pelosi told MSNBC: ""I said to everyone - let's just hold off.  ""Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president."" Around a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump. On Tuesday, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent.  Although he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a ""landslide"".  Pat Ryan, a congressman from New York, later wrote on X: “For the good of our country, for my two young kids, I’m asking Joe Biden to step aside."" And Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told reporters he was ""deeply concerned"" about Mr Biden's ability to win the election. The Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was ""running this race to the end"".  Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to speak to Mr Biden by Friday to discuss the concerns brought by several congressional party members. Overall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however.  Gavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still “all in” with Mr Biden.  The Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and progressive  House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed Mr Biden.  On Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: ""I'm with Joe."" Axios, however, reports that Mr Schumer has been privately telling donors he is open to dumping Mr Biden. Questions about the Biden campaign were also swirling at the Nato summit in Washington DC. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he was confident the US would remain a committed member of the alliance - no matter who sits in the White House next year, Mr Biden or Nato-sceptic Mr Trump. At a news conference, the BBC asked Mr Stoltenberg if all 32 members of the alliance shared his optimism, despite the concerns over Mr Biden's candidacy. ""I'm not saying we can always disregard concerns,” said Mr Stoltenberg. ""But the more dangerous the world is, the more obvious it is we need Nato."" He added: ""It is in the interest of all of us to stand together. That also applies for the United States."" Mr Biden will deliver a rare solo news conference on Thursday, and on Monday will record an interview with NBC News, to be broadcast later in the evening. In the swing state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Democratic voters who spoke to the BBC had mixed feelings about Mr Biden. Karren Gillchrist, in Harrisburg, said she remained firmly behind Mr Biden because “he knows exactly what he’s talking about”. But in Elizabethtown, Melissa Nash, working on her laptop in a cafe, said: “I’m torn because I’m not a fan of Trump, but at the same time you need somebody strong to lead the country.” Additional reporting from Rebecca Hartmann in Pennsylvania",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy68gxw32zno,"Brandon Drenon and Bernd Debusmann, at the Nato summit,",2024-07-10 22:58:52,
241,Triple killing suspect captured near cemetery,"A suspect wanted over a crossbow attack which left three women dead has been captured. A major police manhunt for Kyle Clifford, 26, ended when he was found injured near a cemetery in North London. The victims, who were the wife and two daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt, were attacked at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire. A woman who knows the family described them as ""kind, friendly and gentle"" people who ""always made time for others"". Police said the suspect, who left the army two years ago after a short stint, was receiving medical treatment for his injuries, but that ""no shots were fired"" by officers.  Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were found seriously injured at a house in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, just before 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and all died at the scene. Luisa, 36, said she had been a client of Louise's dog grooming business, Groom and Glow, for three years. She added: ""I hope they are remembered as wonderful, hardworking, kind women, rather than victims."" BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Mark Chapman sent his ""love and thoughts"" to fellow commentator and friend Mr Hunt after a ""heartbreaking day"". Speaking through tears at the start of the Euro 2024 pre-match show on 5 Live, Mr Chapman said: ""This has been a heartbreaking day. ""John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries."" A friend of Louise Hunt said he was ""in denial"" about her murder and felt ""angry, sad and in shock"". He told BBC News: ""I couldn't believe what had happened at first. ""I'd heard the news from my sister early in the morning before I'd figured out who the victims were and, once I found out, it's been a massive shock. [I've] been in denial. ""I can't even begin to imagine what the father's going through."" Referring to England's victory at Euro 2024, former footballer Michael Owen posted on X: ""And while the country celebrate, spare a thought for John Hunt. I can't remember feeling so utterly horrified in years. Those poor girls. Truly horrific."" Det Insp Justine Jenkins, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims’ family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened. “This investigation is moving at pace and formal identification of the victims is yet to take place."" Prior to the capture armed police had arrived in numbers at a cemetery close to where a house was searched in Enfield. Officers closed off the the Lavender Hill Cemetery and an air ambulance was seen nearby. Earlier, local councillor Louise Nicolas wrote, in a post on Facebook, that she was ""deeply saddened to learn this morning of the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident"". ""Should anyone wish to speak with us or require any support please do not hesitate to get in touch,"" said Ms Nicolas, a Liberal Democrat who represents the North Bushey ward on Hertsmere Borough Council.

244,"Baldwin 'played make-believe' with gun, Rust trial hears","Alec Baldwin's trial opened in New Mexico on Wednesday with the prosecution and defence painting starkly different pictures of the events leading up to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.  Mr Baldwin, known for roles on the sitcom 30 Rock and portraying Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, is facing up to 18 months in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Ms Hutchins, 42, died after a gun Mr Baldwin was rehearsing with went off. It was found that the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, accidentally mixed up dummy bullets with live ammunition she had brought from home.  Mr Baldwin has pleaded not guilty and maintains he never pulled the trigger when the gun went off.  In their opening statements, the defence portrayed Mr Baldwin as an actor simply doing his job, who placed his trust in a crew charged with ensuring weapon safety. Prosecutors argued he was a man with a flagrant disregard for gun safety on a film set with a small budget and an inexperienced cast.  Prosecutor Erlinda Johnson opened the trial by telling the jury that the case was ""simple"" and ""straightforward"".  Mr Baldwin ""played make-believe with a real gun"" and ""violated the cardinal rules of firearms safety"", Ms Johnson argued.  “While it was a movie set, it was a real, live workplace for many people,"" she said in her opening statements. ""You will hear that this workplace was on a tight budget... and some of the people who were hired were inexperienced."" Mr Baldwin's defence team, however, argued firearms are treated differently on a film set, where each member of a cast has a designated role and obligation, including when it comes to safety and firearms.  ""He was just acting as he's done for generations, and it was the safety apparatus that failed them all,"" Baldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro said. ""Alec Baldwin committed no crime,"" he said firmly, later adding: ""It was an actor handling a prop.""  Those crew members responsible for safety - including Gutierrez-Reed and David Halls, an assistant director and safety co-ordinator - failed their jobs, he argued.  ""Real bullets are never supposed to be on movie sets,"" Mr Spiro said. Both Halls and Gutierrez-Reed faced charges in the fatal shooting.  Halls has pleaded guilty to unsafe handling of a firearm and Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year, and sentenced to 18 months in prison.  A key issue during the trial is Mr Baldwin's claim that he did not pull the trigger when the revolver he was holding went off. Prosecutors took aim at the claim early, detailing the extensive FBI tests done on the weapon.  It ""worked perfectly fine as it was designed,"" Ms Johnson told the jury.  Mr Baldwin's team also brought up the tests and noted that during one of them, the FBI destroyed parts of the weapon - thus preventing it from being used for further analysis as part of their defence.  The rest of the trial will feature several witnesses and video and audio from the Rust  set, including from the day Ms Hutchins was killed.  The first witness called on Wednesday was Officer Nicholas LeFleur, who responded to the scene and tried to aid Hutchins after she was shot.  Footage from his body camera was shown in court. The room, which can hold about 100 people, was filled with heavy sighs as they watched some of Ms Hutchins' last moments.  Mr Baldwin was visibly uncomfortable, leaning back and forth and at some times grimacing and covering his face.  The trial is set to continue until 19 July. Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4wlkl9e9o,"Christal Hayes, Samantha Granville and Emma Vardy,",2024-07-10 22:16:52,
243,Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it’s possible,"It's long been known that our lifestyles can help to keep us healthier for longer. Now scientists are asking whether new technology can also help slow down the ageing process of our brains by keeping track of what happens to them as we get older. One sunny morning, 76-year-old Dutch-born Marijke and her husband Tom welcomed me in for breakfast at their home in Loma Linda, an hour east of Los Angeles.  Oatmeal, chai seeds, berries, but no processed sugary cereal or coffee were served - a breakfast as pure as Loma Linda’s mission. Loma Linda has been identified as one of the world’s so-called Blue Zones, places where people have lengthier-than-average lifespans. In this case, it is the city’s Seventh-Day Adventist Church community who are living longer. They generally don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, stick to a vegetarian or even vegan diet and consider it a duty of their religion to look after their bodies as best they can.  This is their “health message”, as they call it, and it has put them on the map - the city has been the subject of decades of research into why its residents live better for longer. Dr Gary Fraser from the University of Loma Linda told me members of the Seventh-Day Adventist community there can expect not only a longer lifespan, but an increased “healthspan” - that is, time spent in good health - of four to five years extra for women and seven years extra for men. Marijke and Tom had moved to the city later in life, but both were now firmly embedded in the community.  There’s no great secret to Loma Linda. Its citizens are simply living a really healthy life, keeping mentally stimulated and valuing the community a religion can often provide. There are regular lectures on healthy living, musical get-togethers and exercise classes. I chatted to Judy, who lives with 112 others at an assisted living facility where there was always the “ability to have heart-opening, brain-opening conversations”, she told me. “What I didn't realise was how important socialisation is to your brain... without it, it seems to shrink and go away,” Judy said.  Science has long recognised the benefits of social interactions and avoiding loneliness.  But now it's also possible to identify whose brains are ageing faster than they should, so they can be tracked and in future potentially be treated better preventatively.  As we move towards more personalised, predictive, preventative healthcare models, early diagnosis will be crucial in all areas of health - powered by the incredible possibilities of AI and big data. Click: Mind over matter Lara Lewington travels to California to meet the scientists and experts researching our brain health and investigating whether we can change how our brains age. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Computer models that assess how our brains age and predict their decline were shown to me by Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology and computational biology at the University of Southern California. He had created them using MRI scans, data from 15,000 brains and the power of artificial intelligence to understand the trajectory of both brains that are ageing healthily and those in which there is a disease process, such as dementia.  “It's a very sophisticated way to look at patterns that we don't necessarily know about as humans, but the AI algorithm is able to pick up on them,” he said. Prof Irimia did, of course, take a look inside my head.  I'd had a functional MRI scan ahead of my visit and, after analysing its results, Prof Irimia told me I had a brain age eight months older than my chronological age (although apparently the bit that controls talking wasn’t ageing so much. I could have told him that). However, Prof Irimia suggested that the results fall within a two-year error margin. Private companies are starting to commercialise this technology, too. One firm, Brainkey, is offering the service in a variety of clinics around the world. Its founder Owen Philips told me that in future, getting an MRI should become easier. ""It’s becoming much more accessible for people to get an MRI scan, and the images coming off them are getting even better and better,” he said.  “I don't mean to nerd out there. But the technology is just getting to a point where we are able to see things much earlier than we could in the past. And that means we can understand exactly what's happening in an individual patient's brain. With AI, we can support that.” In contrast to what Prof Irimia’s analysis of my MRI scan had told me, Brainkey’s estimate knocked a year off my brain’s biological age. I was also presented with a 3D-printed model of it, which appeared substantial and, I was assured, was life-sized.   The aim here is not just a more precise approach to treatment, but also to be able to quantify how well any interventions are working. Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the past 200 years have given rise to a host of age-related diseases. I did wonder whether, if we all lived long enough, dementia might come knocking at all our doors. Prof Irimia said this was a theory many have investigated albeit not proven, adding that the aim was to find a way to keep on pushing dementia back, hopefully beyond our life expectancies. And all of this takes us back to the same point. Every scientist and doctor, as well as those Blue Zoners, say lifestyle is key. Good diet, keeping active, mentally stimulated and happy are crucial to how our brains age. There’s another important factor too, according to Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book Why We Sleep. “Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do every day to reset your brain and body health,” he evangelised. “There is no operation of your mind that is not wonderfully enhanced when you get sleep, or demonstrably impaired when you don’t get enough.” He spoke of our brains’ cleansing system, which functions during our slumber by washing away the beta-amyloid and tau proteins - these are “two of the main culprits underlying Alzheimer’s”. Changes in sleep patterns are also associated with dementia. Prof Walker described how we don’t just see this in our 60s or 70s - it can begin during our 30s. So, identifying those changes through sleep tracking could potentially become a “model of midlife prevention”. Fauna Bio, a biotech company on the outskirts of San Francisco, is collecting data on ground squirrels during and after hibernation. In this state of torpor, as it is known, the squirrels’ body temperature drops and their metabolic rate is reduced to just 1% of normal.  During this time, they appear to be able to regrow neurons and remake the connections their brains had lost. The company’s aim is to try and create drugs to replicate this process in humans, without them needing to spend half the year underground. Even if some may long for that. Untreated depression has also been shown to raise our risk of dementia. Professor Leanne Williams of Stanford University has identified a method of “visualising” some forms of depression on the brain using an MRI scan, and thus seeing if treatment has worked.  This may be able to help scientists understand more about the root causes of mental health conditions such as depression, as well as providing a way to quantify how treatment is going for a patient. Few have put more faith in science to achieve longevity than Bryan Johnson - the tech entrepreneur spending millions in an effort to reverse his biological age.  Dozens of supplements, 19 hours a day of fasting, workouts that make him look as though he’s going to burst and an array of (sometimes controversial) treatments are what he hopes will turn back the clock. But as 103-year-old Mildred, who I visited in Loma Linda said forcefully, “You absolutely need to be very careful with your diet, it’s true, but I’m not down for, ‘You've got to do this, and this, and this, and absolutely not touch this! '”.

State media said the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal convicted the defendants of ""creating a terrorist organisation"".  United Nations experts and human rights groups have severely criticised the mass trial. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said more than 80 human rights defenders and political dissidents - known as the ""UAE 84"" - were put on trial. Last January, the UAE's prosecutor general referred the defendants to the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal on charges of ""establishing another clandestine organisation for the purpose of committing acts of violence and terrorism on UAE soil"" known as the ""Justice and Dignity Committee"".  He said most of the defendants were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UAE since 2014. Its local affiliate, the al-Islah party, is also banned. According to the official WAM news agency, on Wednesday the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal ""sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment for the crime of creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation"". In addition to the 43 life sentences handed out, 10 other defendants were jailed for 10 to 15 years in prison on the charges of ""co-operating with al-Islah"" and money laundering, WAM said. One defendant was acquitted and 24 cases were ruled inadmissible, it added. The bulk of the defendants have been in prison for more than a decade after they were jailed as part of the ""UAE 94"" trial in 2013, according to HRW and Amnesty International.  Many had already completed their sentences. But UAE authorities said the latest charges were ""materially distinct"" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a ""terrorist organisation"", AFP news agency reported. According to Amnesty International, the indictment, charges, defence lawyers and names of defendants were ""kept secret by the government"". It said details were only known through ""leaks"". HRW identified three of those sentenced to life in prison were Nasser bin Ghaith, Abdulsalam Darwish al-Marzouqi and Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi. Prominent activist Ahmed Mansoor was among the defendants, it added. Reacting to the sentencings, Amnesty International’s Devin Kenney urged the UAE to ""urgently revoke this unlawful verdict"" and called on those sentenced to be released. ""The trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law, including the principle that you cannot try the same person twice for the same crime, and the principle that you cannot punish people retroactively under laws that didn’t exist at the time of the alleged offence."" Khalid Ibrahim of the Gulf Center for Human Rights, on whose board Ahmed Mansoor sits, said: ""It is a real tragedy that so many activists and human rights defenders will remain in prison for decades, deprived of watching their children grow up, for no other reason than calling for a better future for Emiratis."" Despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the Middle East and promoting high-tech sectors and innovations, the UAE remains restrictive on political activity. The federation of seven emirates, which include Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has no official opposition and bans political parties. In 2013, almost 70 Islamists were given jail sentences over an alleged plot to overthrow the government.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y783d9jeo,"Thomas Mackintosh,",2024-07-10 18:09:52,
240,NBA star to become first black Greek Olympic flagbearer,"Greek basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo is to become the first black athlete to bear the flag for Greece at the Olympics. The two-time NBA MVP will carry the flag alongside race walker Antigoni Ntrismpioti in Paris on 26 July. The Greek men’s basketball team qualified for its first Olympic Games since 2008, after beating Croatia in front of a home crowd in Piraeus on Sunday. The 29-year-old, who was drafted by Milwaukee Bucks in 2013 and led them to the 2021 NBA title, was in tears after the game.  ""It's an incredible feeling,"" he said after qualification. ""Since I was a kid I always wanted to play in the Olympic Games."" His journey to become Greece's Olympic flagbearer hasn't been an easy one. Antetokounmpo's parents emigrated to Greece from Nigeria. For the first 18 years of his life, Antetokounmpo could not travel outside Greece and was effectively stateless, having no papers either from Greece or Nigeria. He was eventually issued Greek citizenship in May 2013, less than two months before the NBA draft. Antetokounmpo spoke about his childhood in a recent interview with ESPN.  ""I used to sell things since I can remember myself, since I was six or seven years old. “I was always out of home trying as much as I could to help my mom and dad by selling watches, glasses, CDs, DVDs, and everything I could find. I was doing that until I turned 17 because I had to. I had no other choice. When I was selling all those things, I was the best seller."" But even after becoming a star in the US, Antetokounmpo encountered racism at home.  In a TNT documentary in 2020, he said: ""Greece is a country of white people, life can be difficult for someone with the colour of my skin. Or of another nationality. You go to a lot of neighbourhoods, and you face a lot of racism."" There was a backlash to his comments from some in Greece, including Konstantinos Kalemis, then-coordinator for refugee education in the Malakasa camp north of Athens, who used a range of racial slurs against Antetokounmpo and was fired as a result.  He has also faced discrimination from government officials. In 2018, Adonis Georgiadis, the current health minister, repeatedly mispronounced his name and falsely claimed he had been born in Africa instead of Greece. Antetokounmpo will be one of the first athletes to open the Games, as Greece - the birthplace of the Olympics - traditionally leads the parade. Spyros Kapralos, president of the Greek Olympic Committee, said there was ""unanimity"" in the decision for Antetokounmpo to carry the flag in Paris. He added that both flagbearers will ""lift our country high"". Antetokounmpo hasn't publicly commented yet, but simply posted a video to X showing highlights from the qualifying campaign with the word ""Greece"".

234,‘Dad tried to kill us’: The house fire that devastated Australia,"The night comes back in fragments: the sound of exploding glass, the frantic call made to police, the tiny shivering bodies emerging from the flames. Eve’s hand shakes as she pieces it together. She is sitting in her living room in Western Sydney, the burnt-out blackened shell of her neighbour's house - now a crime scene splashed across Australia’s national news - visible through the blinds. What happened on this quiet street in the early hours of Sunday morning is hard to reconcile. A fire that would leave three children dead - including a 5-month-old baby girl - and four more hospitalised alongside their mother. And a stunning allegation: that this horror - so evident in the wreckage left behind and on the faces of those who witnessed it - was inflicted on these children by their father, who then blocked their attempts to flee. New South Wales Police are treating the Lalor Park house fire as a domestic violence-related multiple homicide, and the state’s premier has said the 28-year-old father of seven could face “the most serious charges on offer”. The case, which has sparked mass outrage, comes while Australia is already in the grips of a self-declared “national crisis” of domestic and family violence -  a child is dying at the hands of a parent almost once a fortnight, according to research. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has offered a flurry of reforms and funding to stop the scourge. But he conceded on Tuesday - in response to a string of alleged killings this week - that the country “has a long way to go” to turn the tide: ""Again, we have seen lives stolen, futures torn away. Every death is its own universe of devastation.” Eve - who has asked to have her name changed due to safety concerns - still can’t come to terms with what happened. “We feel ashamed, we didn’t know there was a baby inside”, she told the BBC, erupting in tears as she begins offering a timeline of the fire. Somehow, she “blames herself” for the deaths of the children across the road because she didn’t notice the inferno sooner, didn’t call emergency services fast enough. And yet, her actions were both brave and consequential. She and her husband were alerted to the violence unfolding by another neighbour, Jarrod Hawkins, who came to their home looking for reinforcements. Mr Hawkins said he had been woken by a “loud pop” shortly before 01:00 local time (15:00 GMT). Worried his car might be being broken into, he went outside, and immediately saw the flames. He says he ran across the road without pausing to think and tried to beat the door down. In the moments that followed Mr Hawkins would crawl into the house repeatedly to pull out three children - two young boys aged four and seven, and a girl aged nine. An 11-year-old would eventually be rescued by police, along with two boys aged two and six found in a critical condition, who died a short time later in hospital. Mr Hawkins then woke up Eve and her family who phoned the authorities. Soon, Eve’s husband was on their neighbour’s lawn, trying to put out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. Eve helped usher some of the children from the scene - doing her best to calm them and keep them warm as they adjusted to the freezing air outside. She remembers one of the boys saying blankly at one point: “He tried to kill me”. Another rescuer would later tell a local paper they heard a similar remark from several of the tiny survivors: “Dad tried to kill us”. But it was an innocent exchange Eve shared with the four-year-old who escaped, as he looked back at the charred remains of his home, that stays with her. “He just kept asking whether his toys would be safe inside.” As emergency services started to take control of the scene, Eve took her cue to leave. One of the final things she witnessed was “police carrying the Dad out, who was in his underwear”.  She would soon learn that the 5-month-old girl had died before rescuers could attempt to revive her. Speaking to media later Sunday morning, Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty alleged the children’s father had tried to stop “police, responders and neighbours” from entering the burning house, “with the intention of keeping the kids inside”. “At this stage it does appear the 28-year-old is responsible for multiple deaths of young lives that have been tragically taken away,” Det Supt Doherty added. Now, a makeshift memorial lies on Freeman Street. The colourful flowers and cards offering messages of support stand in stark contrast to the police tape and forensics tent. Members of the community have described the children as “lively”, “outgoing” and “polite”. “They were known to a lot of people - those kids were unreal, great manners… full of energy, just typical kids,” Mr Hawkins had earlier told ABC News. “They were happy,” another neighbour says simply. As masked investigators sift through their house, an elderly resident watches on. Choked by tears, he literally can’t speak about his memories of the family.  Premier Chris Minns has called the tragedy a “deep wound” that will be widely felt. “These children deserved a loving home with safety and security - instead, they’re gone,” he added, promising that those who remain would get the support they needed. It is hard to say where Australia sits internationally on the issue, but filicide - when a parent intentionally kills their child - is the second most common form of domestic homicide in the country. In most cases, the families have a history of child abuse, intimate partner violence, or both, says a recent study by the national research organisation for women’s safety. State and federal governments have begun investing in prevention - which means examining the social drivers of violence - early intervention, bolstering crisis response networks, and supporting families as they recover. And Australia’s latest budget set aside A$1 bn (£526m; $673m) to assist with those aims. “My government is determined to end this violence. Together, we can make this change. We must,” Mr Albanese said on Tuesday, flagging a previous commitment to build 720 emergency safe houses by 2027 to accommodate women and children fleeing abuse. Critics though, have described the measure as a “drop in a very large ocean of need” - saying the money being spent doesn’t match the scale of the crisis. “[This] will accommodate at most a mere 3% of women and children seeking housing. Moreover, waiting three years for these facilities to be built is cold comfort to women and children being killed by family and domestic violence now,” Larissa Waters, the Senate leader for the Australian Greens said. The four children and their mother who survived the unimaginable events at Lalor Park are in a stable condition, while their father remains in an induced coma, under police guard. On Tuesday, authorities closed off the street so that the 29-year-old woman could be given a few quiet moments to grieve in private - as she took in the sight of her now unrecognisable home. Dressed in black, with a hospital band visible on her wrist, she picked up cards and floral tributes, as loved ones held her close.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3egwnq0veo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-10 07:09:52,
238,A photographer's 11-day trek to flee war-torn Sudan,"On the eve of his perilous escape from his home country last month, Sudanese photojournalist Mohamed Zakaria left his camera equipment with a friend, not sure if he would ever see it again. He was fleeing el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, which is in the grip of a punishing battle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Mohamed had been covering this hot spot of Sudan’s 15-month long civil war for the BBC. But with the situation growing increasingly desperate, he decided it was time to escape. The RSF escalated a siege of el-Fasher in May, targeting the last army foothold in Darfur. Shortly afterward Mohamed’s house was hit by a shell, another struck as he was trying to get wounded neighbours to hospital. Five people were killed and 19 injured - Mohamed still has pieces of shrapnel in his body, while his brother lost an eye. Two weeks later Mohamed watched his mother and three brothers depart for the safety of Chad, the neighbouring country to the west. He stayed behind to continue working to support them, he says. But as the RSF fighters continued to close in, civilians were trapped in a war zone of indiscriminate shelling and army airstrikes, with food supplies cut off. “I couldn’t move, I couldn’t work,” he says. “All you do now in el-Fasher is just stay in your home and wait for death… some residents had to dig trenches in their homes.” It was dangerous to stay, but also dangerous to flee. In the end he decided to head for South Sudan and eventually on to Uganda.  He thought this journey would be safer for him than trying to join his family in Chad, and would allow him to work once he got to his destination. From el-Fasher to South Sudan, Mohamed passed through 22 checkpoints, five manned by the army and 17 by the RSF.  He was searched and sometimes interrogated, but managed to conceal his identity as a cameraman who had documented the war.  Except for once. The first stop, on 10 June, was Zamzam refugee camp on the outskirts of el-Fasher.  Mohamed and his travelling companion, his cousin Muzamil, spent the night with a friend. Here he hid his camera and other tools of the trade.  But he took with him a precious record of his photographs and videos - stored on memory cards and in two external hard drives - as well as his laptop and phone. “The biggest problem I faced on the road was how I could hide them,” he said. “Because these are dangerous things. If the RSF or any soldier sees them, you can't explain.” For the first major leg of the trek, Mohamed stashed them in a hole under the foot pedals of the pickup, without telling the driver. He and Muzamil were held up at one checkpoint by Sudanese soldiers suspicious they were heading into RSF territory to join the enemy. But otherwise, they reached Dar es Salaam, the town that marked the end of army control, without incident. Here they joined other travellers - a convoy of six vehicles en route to the village of Khazan Jadid. “We paid the RSF soldiers to go with us,” says Mohamed. “If you want to arrive safely you need to pay the RSF.” The drivers collected money from the passengers and handed it over at the first checkpoint, where one of the RSF fighters got into each car. At this point Mohammed hid his memory cards in a piece of paper that he put with other documents. At the bus station in Khazan Jadid, Mohammed found only three vehicles. “The road was very dangerous,” he says, “and all the cars had stopped travelling.” But they managed to get one going to the city of el-Daein, the capital of East Darfur and they reached there in the early afternoon of 12 June. At a checkpoint in the middle of town, those coming from el-Fasher were put to one side, says Mohamed, under suspicion that they had worked with the army. Here’s where he ran into trouble. He had deleted all the messages, photographs and apps on his mobile phone.  But the RSF officer found a Facebook account he had forgotten to remove, complete with posts he had shared about the bombing of el-Fasher and the suffering of civilians. There followed an hours-long interrogation where Mohamed was separated from Muzamil and accused of being a spy. “I was threatened with torture and death unless I disclosed the information I had,” he says. “I felt lost. It was a very bad situation. If he wanted to kill you, he could do it and no-one would know. He can kill you, he can beat you, he can he can do anything to you.” Mohamed was finally released at 19:00 after negotiating the payment of a large sum of money. “This was the worst moment,” he says, reflecting on the experience, “not only in the journey but I think the worst moment in my whole life… because I didn’t see any hope. I can’t believe I’m here.” Mohamed suspected his interrogator would alert another checkpoint down the road to arrest him again.  He and Muzamil raced to the station to get out of town as fast as they could. There was only one vehicle, a pickup truck that was crammed full, but they managed to squeeze into a small space on the roof. They made it as far as the village of Abu Matariq, where the engine broke down and took two days to fix. Having survived arrest Mohamed was anxious to get to South Sudan as quickly as possible. Instead, he faced a lengthy delay. The travellers finally left Abu Matariq on 14 June heading to el-Raqabat, the last town in East Darfur before the border. The way led through the forest of el-Deim, a flat expanse of grass and sand sprinkled with acacia trees. Heavy rains slowed and then stopped their progress, as the pickup got stuck in the mud. They were stranded. “It was a severe ordeal,” says Mohamed.  “We spent nearly six days without drinkable water and food. We mostly relied on rainwater and dates.” In a stroke of luck, they were able to buy two sheep from passing shepherds. During the course of the journey, says Mohamed, he did not have trouble getting food. The RSF-controlled areas through which they passed had seen battles early in the war, but had stabilised somewhat since then.  Markets and small restaurants were operating. Food was expensive, but not “super expensive” like in el-Fasher, where many people were forced to ration themselves to one meal a day. In the forest, the men slept in the open, sometimes in the rain, while the two women and two children in the party stayed inside the vehicle. They had to pick thorns out of their feet from walking without shoes in the mud. Eventually they pushed the pickup back onto solid ground. But the engine worked only sporadically because of a weak battery. And then it ran out of fuel. At this point two of the men set off to find the nearest village. It turned out to be a nine-hour walk. To everyone’s relief they returned late in the day with extra fuel and another vehicle. Arriving in el-Raqabat, Mohamed and Muzamil were just a 15-minute drive from South Sudan and safety. But the next morning before the travellers could start out, they were picked up and taken to the main RSF office and interrogated for three hours. Someone had reported that members of the Zaghawa ethnic group had entered the town. That included Mohamed, as well as the family sharing the car with him.  The Zaghawa make up one of the armed groups fighting alongside the army in el-Fasher, and the RSF view them as enemies. Mohamed stashed his memory cards, hard drives and laptop with one of the women and told the RSF officer that he was a computer engineer. Once again it came down to a pay-off: 30,000 Sudanese pounds ($50; £39) from everyone. Mohamed and a few other members of the group paid extra to release another man who had been found with a photo of an army soldier on his phone. Then Mohamed and Muzamil clambered into a motorised rickshaw and headed for the border. Crossing into South Sudan on 20 June was an “unbelievable” moment for Mohamed. “When I saw the South Sudanese men, I thanked God and prayed,” he says. “I felt I'm alive. I really didn't believe that I am alive, that I am here. I reached South Sudan with all my data and my laptop, even though I had many encounters with the RSF.” He called his mother as soon as he was able to buy a local SIM card. “She didn't believe that I was alive,” he says. Mohamed had been out of internet range for 11 days, and his family had no idea where he was or what was happening to him during that time. “They were very very worried,” he says. “Most of them had told me you must not try this road, don’t go, you can't make it.” But he had made it. He stopped in the South Sudanese city of Aweil for a few days, where the Zaghawa family he had been travelling with hosted him in their home.  He then moved on to the capital, Juba.  Muzamil decided to stay there, but Mohamed travelled to Uganda and registered as a refugee at a camp near the border because his passport had expired. Twenty-three days after leaving el-Fasher, Mohamed arrived in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on 3 July. He is staying with his uncle. “I honestly have no idea where life will take me from this point,” he says. His immediate priority is to look after his family and try to reunite them. Besides his mother and three brothers in Chad, he has a brother in Turkey and a sister in the United Arab Emirates. His dream for the future is to return to Sudan in more peaceful times and set up a university in Darfur to teach filmmaking, photography and media studies. “My work did not end after leaving el-Fasher,” he says. “I believe that was just a phase and now I have really begun arranging the second phase by working to convey the truth of the situation there.  ""I hope that my effort, even if just a little, will help shorten the duration of the war and save the people in el-Fasher.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

237,What are cognitive tests and what can they tell us about Biden and Trump?,"Age and mental fitness recently have become a leading issue in the US presidential race.  While the issue has loomed over President Joe Biden, 81, and his opponent Donald Trump, 78, in the past, things reached a tipping point after Biden's weak debate performance late last month.  Mr Biden is the oldest president in US history and Trump, if elected, would be the second oldest.  Mr Biden, during an interview with ABC News, refused to commit to taking a cognitive test, saying he has ""a cognitive test every day"" and his doctors say he doesn't need one.  Trump has said he has completed cognitive tests, one while he was president, and another more recently. He said he aced both.  Here's what the tests are, their purpose and how hard they are to pass.  There are different tests and screenings to measure how well the brain is functioning.  They don't determine a specific disease, but help signal if additional tests are needed for diagnosis, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  Typically, a cognitive screening could be warranted if a person is having problems with memory, personality changes, or balance, or if they are repeating themself, forgetting parts of their past or having problems understanding information.  One of the most widely used tests is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a quick way to ""assess cognitive skills in people with suspected deficits,"" according to Sanford Medicine.  The assessment tests orientation, memory, attention and the ability to name objects, and follow verbal and written commands. It's also available online.  It's typically easy for someone without cognitive impairment, but is harder for those declining mentally.  The creator of the test, Canadian neurologist Ziad Nasreddine, told the BBC that he thought the test could be good for Biden - both as a way to reassure Americans and in case there is a problem.  In brief cognitive tests, medical professionals ask patients a variety of learning and memory questions. Longer clinical evaluations include cognitive tests plus a physical and neurological exam and a full history of a patient.  The latter could paint a clearer picture of the cognitive abilities of both Mr Biden and Trump, said Dan Mungas, an associate director of the University of California's Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.  Often medical professions will start with a brief test, such as the MoCa, and if their score is lower than expected, they move to a more comprehensive examination.  More in-depth tests assess language, executive function and visual-spatial abilities.  For example, a medical professional may read a story to a patient then ask them to recall parts of the story to test memory and learning abilities.  A patient might be asked to recall a list of words, name objects in pictures or name items that start with a specific letter.  In addition to questioning the patient, Dr Mungas suggests speaking with people who spend time with the patient regularly to determine symptoms of cognitive decline. Dr Mungas said it is important to see if someone's abilities have changed over time, adding that a one-time assessment can be misleading.   ""You have to understand where a person started out, if they're declining from where they've been before, that's a bad sign,"" he said.  But he notes, cognitive tests are not everything.  ""The idea that there’s a simple cognitive test that says this person's going to be a good president doesn’t make any sense and I’ve been doing cognitive testing all my career,” Dr Mungas said.  The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends doctors assess people older than 65 for their cognitive abilities. That determination was made because as age increases, so does the likelihood of impairments, Dr Nasreddine told the BBC.  By age 75, 25% of patients will have a cognitive disorder of some kind, he warned.  ""It becomes extremely frequent that cognitive impairment is present, and sometimes it’s present without people realising it’s present,” said Dr Nasreddine, who has neither treated nor met the president. He said he has noticed a change in Mr Biden in the past year. In public appearances, the president moves slowly, his speech has slowed, his voice is very low, and he mumbles and slurs some words, he said.  Not many people have such an intense job at Mr Biden's age, he noted, and it is difficult to describe the normal function of someone at that age. ""I haven't seen this [decline] in previous years, only in the past year I have seen this,"" he said.   Dr Nasreddine noted that, despite only being three years younger, Trump seems more vigorous.  The 25th Amendment of the US Constitution lays out the line of succession and procedure if a president dies or is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"".  The amendment notes it should be used if a president is removed from office, incapacitated, dies or resigns.  The amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy but has become a topic of debate in recent years.  Congressional lawmakers eyed legislation during Trump's presidency that would alter the amendment to enable a panel of medical experts to determine a president's fitness for office.  Democrats also approved a House resolution after the US Capitol riots in 2021 that called for then-Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.  Neither move went anywhere.  Following Mr Biden's debate performance, some Republicans have called on members of his cabinet to invoke the clause.  Section 4 of the amendment states if the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet or Congress deem the president is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,"" then the vice-president would take office.  It has never been used or tested in the case of mental decline. ",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngrlnlr08o,"Ana Faguy and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-09 23:09:52,
236,Cypress Hill make 28-year-old Simpsons joke come true,"It was back in 1996 when an episode of The Simpsons featured a joke where Cypress Hill believed they had mistakenly booked the London Symphony Orchestra, whilst under the influence. On Wednesday night, that joke becomes a reality at the Royal Albert Hall.  After years of fan pressure, the American hip-hop group reached out to the LSO over social media and a deal was struck. The one-night only performance in London is based around their acclaimed Black Sunday album. It sold more than three million copies in the US and spent a whole year on the UK charts. The LSO will perform unique orchestral arrangements of the band’s most iconic songs including Insane in the Brain and I Wanna Get High. Cypress Hill have sold more than 20 million albums worldwide and are one of hip-hop’s biggest acts. I went to meet the band at their rehearsals in central London. ""It's been something that we've talked about for many years since the Simpsons episode first aired,"" B-Real (real name Louis Mario Freese) told the BBC.  ""So it's very special for us. And it's coming off the heels of our 30th anniversary for our Black Sunday album."" They called the ability to play on London's most famous stage ""one of those checklist moments"". ""We've played a lot of historical venues throughout our career and stuff like that, but nothing as prestigious as this."" In the Simpsons episode, Homerpalooza, Homer is shocked while on a school run that his music tastes are not considered cool. He then tries to impress the kids by going to the Hullabalooza music festival - a play on the Lollapalooza music festival held in Chicago - and hanging out with rap and rock stars including Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins. The British connection goes beyond the LSO. In the episode, it was actually Peter Frampton, best known for his 1976 album Frampton Comes Alive, who was the guy trying to book the orchestra. Cypress Hill laughed when I asked if he was on the guestlist. ""Yes, actually, we've been trying to invite him,"" B-Real said.  ""We've never met him before, but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton."" They're still waiting for a reply. LSO first violin and board vice-chair Maxine Kwok said ""people are beyond excited at the idea of these diverse musicians mixing on the stage"". ""Being a child of the nineties I remember the episode well,"" she told the BBC, sharing that it was a cultural reference and ""running joke"" for years each time the episode was repeated. At rehearsals there have been cultural differences, leading to misunderstandings.  When the word ""glock"" was used, the LSO took it to mean the percussion instrument the glockenspiel. To Cypress Hill, glock will always be a gun.  This isn't the first time an event in The Simpsons has accurately predicted what has happened in reality many years in the future. However, some social media posts about The Simpsons predicting the future have been fake. Whether the show writers can predict the future or not.... For Cypress Hill, at least, they feel tonight’s show has been their destiny. Later in their career, the act said they became more experimental ""combining hip-hop with rock or metal or punk or reggae or electronic"" and that their new orchestral collaboration is part of who they are as ""out-of-the-box artists"". ""We salute The Simpsons because if they had not written that episode, we probably wouldn't be doing this.""",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3j8y6vnw4o,"Colin Paterson,",2024-07-10 01:09:52,

Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris said a travel ban preventing Ms Towey from leaving the UAE had been lifted. “The embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go,” he told the Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament). ""The embassy will of course continue to follow up on the case which is still active as of now... and to thank our embassy for the work in relation to that"". Previously the taoiseach said it was ""utterly, utterly unacceptable how an Irish citizen is being treated"". Mr Harris also said he had spoken to Ms Towey and her mother, who is with her in the UAE. He went on to say Ms Towey had ""been the victim of male violence"". ""What Tori has been through is, I think, unimaginable for so many people here in this country, that a woman who has been the victim of a brutal attack found herself waking up not in a hospital, but in a police station,"" he said. On Wednesday, Ann Flynn, Ms Towey's aunt, told BBC Radio Foyle’s North West Today programme that Tori and her whole family had been through a huge ordeal but she hoped the end was now in sight. “The travel ban being lifted is a huge relief, I didn’t actually quite believe it when I heard it,” Ms Flynn said. “Hopefully they will be home tomorrow. They haven’t actually got a flight sorted yet and we are just waiting to hear next steps."" Ms Flynn praised everyone who helped highlight her niece's case. “When they arrive in Ireland, it will be such a relief,” she said. “We just want her home, we just want to start a new chapter with her.” The case came to international attention after it was raised by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald in the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament) on Tuesday. She said Ms Towey's mother had travelled to Dubai to be with her and that she ""wants to come home"". ""She has been the victim of the most gross domestic violence,"" Ms McDonald said. ""Her passport has been destroyed. There was a travel ban imposed on her."" The Irish government should make it ""absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way"", Ms McDonald told the Dáil, and that ""an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way"". The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the case and was providing consular assistance.

233,Musk defeats ex-Twitter staff seeking $500m in severance,"A US judge has dismissed a case brought by former Twitter staff, who had accused billionaire Elon Musk of unlawfully denying roughly $500m in severance payments owed to workers fired after his takeover of the company. Judge Trina Thompson said the employees had not proven that their claims were protected by federal law.  The ruling is a win for Mr Musk, who purchased Twitter in 2022 and immediately set about making changes, including sacking thousands of staff. The moves sparked multiple lawsuits from former staff and vendors, accusing the company of withholding payments that had been promised. This complaint was filed in 2023 in a federal court in San Francisco by Courtney McMillian, the former ""head of total rewards"" at the social media site, which Mr Musk renamed X. In the complaint, she said the firm had provided staff only one month's worth of pay as severance instead of the far more generous benefits, including at least two months of salary and contributions toward health insurance, that had been promised. Mr Musk's team had urged the judge to reject the complaint, saying that America's Employee Retirement Income Security Act did not apply as claimed.  The act sets standards for private health and pension plans. “We are disappointed in the ruling and considering our options for moving forward,”  a spokesperson for Ms McMillian's team said.  Other cases, including one brought by former leaders of the company, are still working their way through the courts.  In her ruling, Judge Thompson gestured to those disputes, noting that workers might have opportunities elsewhere to prove their claims. ""The Court lacks jurisdiction. However, plaintiffs are not without recourse. Indeed, there are other cases brought against Twitter for the failure to pay wages or provide employee severance benefits during the same or overlapping period,"" she wrote.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72vr64el8yo,"Natalie Sherman,",2024-07-10 18:09:52,

247,Prominent New Zealand couple targeted in deadly US robbery,"A prominent New Zealand couple visiting California were targeted as they left a shopping centre by a crew of suspected robbers who left one of the pair dead. The couple - banker Doug and Patricia “Trish” McKay - had been shopping at Newport Beach's Fashion Island when they were attacked by a group of men on 2 July, officials said. Ms McKay, 68, a friend of New Zealand's prime minister, was killed when she was dragged along a road in the ensuing events, the Orange County District Attorney's Office added. Three suspects have been charged with murder.  Detailing the incident, which took place about 45 miles (72km) south-east of Los Angeles, the DA said two men wearing masks jumped out of a vehicle as the couple waited to be picked up.  They allegedly pointed a gun at Mr McKay's head, ordered him to the ground and demanded he hand over the expensive watch he was wearing. One man attacked Ms McKay, trying to take her shopping bags. He is accused of throwing her to the ground and dragging her into the road. Mr McKay jumped in front of the car and tried to stop his wife from being run over, but a third man driving the car accelerated, the DA's news release stated. The car pushed Mr McKay out of the way but the trio dragged his wife 65 ft (20m) under the vehicle, killing her. A bystander tried to stop the group from fleeing and was shot at by one of the men during the incident. The suspects allegedly led authorities on a high-speed chase for nearly 40 miles. They were arrested and identified as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, and Jaden Cunningham, 18. All three were charged with murder with a felony enhancement that makes them eligible for the death penalty, according to the DA's office. One of the suspects, Mr McCrary, is also facing charges of second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly. It is unclear who is legally representing each of the men. Doug McKay, 69, is a prominent businessman and banker in New Zealand. He was the first CEO of the Auckland Council, a body established in 2010 that helps govern the Auckland Region of the country.   He was also the former chair of the Bank of New Zealand, according to the Los Angeles Times.  The family released a statement to local media, saying: ""No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss"".  The couple's personal friend, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, paid tribute.  ""My thoughts are with the McKay family after the devastating loss of Trish,"" Mr Luxon posted on X. ""They’re great people and my heart goes out to Doug, their family and all those who knew Trish."" Desley Simpson, the deputy mayor of Auckland, said on Facebook that she was ""in absolute shock"". ""Trish was amazing - funny, loyal and loving. My absolute deepest sympathies to Doug and (Ms McKay's) family,"" Ms Simpson said.

248,'Beginning of two legends': Photos of Messi and baby Lamine Yamal resurface,"In 2007, a young Lionel Messi posed for photos with a baby in the dressing room of the Camp Nou in Barcelona for a charity calendar photoshoot. Messi, who was 20, was already making a name for himself and would go on to become arguably the greatest of all time. But little did the photographer know that the baby would also make waves in international football less than 17 years later. Messi was bathing Lamine Yamal - the 16-year-old who is taking the European Championships by storm.  His goal against France in the semi-final on Tuesday is one that will be talked about for decades.  At 16 years and 362 days, the strike also made him the youngest man to score in the tournament's history. The long-forgotten photo of Messi and Yamal resurfaced after Yamal’s father posted it on Instagram last week with the text: “The beginning of two legends.” The photos were taken by Joan Monfort, who works as a freelance photographer for the Associated Press. The shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataró where Lamine’s family lived, he said. ""They signed up for the raffle to have their picture taken at the Camp Nou with a Barça player. And they won the raffle,"" Mr Monfort told the Associated Press. The assignment wasn't a straightforward one, the photographer said. “Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he’s shy,” he said. “He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn’t even know how to hold him at first.” Like Messi, Yamal went on to play for Barcelona, where he became the club's youngest ever starter and goalscorer, as well as the youngest scorer in the Spanish league.  Mr Monfort said it was only when the photo started going viral online last week that he realised that the baby was Yamal. “It’s very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation,” he said.  “To tell you the truth it’s a very nice feeling.”",2024-07-10 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7206gj5w28o,"George Wright,",2024-07-10 07:09:53,
249,From a small village to Bollywood success: 'I'm blessed',"When Punjabi rapper Karan Aujla reflects on his journey so far, he admits it is ""hard to process"". Born in Punjab, his parents died when he was a child and he later moved to Canada ""with just this skill of writing"". The 27-year-old will be touring the UK and Canada in months to come, and his recent release Tauba Tauba will appear in Bad Newz – the first time he has a track in a Bollywood film. ""I'm blessed,"" he tells BBC Asian Network’s Haroon Rashid. ""Coming from such a small village and making it across the globe and getting so much love from people and touring. ""Getting to experience things that you never even knew existed."" Karan’s hits such as Softly, Don’t Look, Red Eyes and On Top have spent multiple weeks in the Official Asian Music Chart and he has more than 13 million monthly Spotify listeners. He is considered one of the most important artists taking Punjabi music global, along with Diljit Dosanjh and AP Dhillon. Karan has previously spoken about having Bollywood offers, but wanting to wait for the right one. ""It was so quick, we decided that we wanted a song for the movie. And I made two ideas, sent them over and they picked one."" ""And I'm happy that they did. It just goes with the vibe of the movie. ""I never felt out of place, the whole team showed me so much love,"" he adds. There’s sometimes been criticism that to fit into Bollywood, artists need to change their style. ""My first thought was to go with a little bit of Hindi. Then I was like OK, that’s not me."" ""It was hard deciding which direction the sound should be… but it just happened like that."" Karan says he is conscious about being original but also offering things for different audiences. The inspiration behind the song was a friend who is ""into Punjabi music"" and the song is about a ""love for Punjabi music"". ""I really wanted it to be easy to catch for the people that don't know Punjabi too much. But I also wanted to keep it [Punjabi] and not have it like a Bollywood sound"". ""I want to keep my own tone original,"" he says. ""It just makes me so happy that the language barrier is gone and it’s all about music. ""It's going global,” he says of Punjabi music. Karan says he has a relaxed approach to making music and takes pride in not overthinking things, describing that as ""a big flex"". ""Every time I get into the studio, I don’t know what I’m going to write about. I just sit there, listen to the beats, make melodies and it just comes. ""I'm really proud of it, because that's how I started as a writer."" Despite increasing success over the years, Karan says he doesn’t ""get nervous"" in the typical way, but that it is ""a different type of feeling"". ""Sometimes you don’t know how it’s going to be when you enter these new rooms. ""But everybody loves your talent if you’re good."" One of the things that helps is the people around him, and he says he is big on brotherhood in the industry. ""It’s really important for me because I grew up around brothers and friendship has had a big role in my career."" But he is forward looking as well, and has the tour on his mind with many fans expected to turn out to see him perform. He reveals that it will be ""a different"" sound to his previous tour, with greater production involved. ""This time I’m coming out with a new band, and nobody is Punjabi. ""Even if I have to put money out of my own pocket, I want to make sure people have the best time of their lives."" ""I’m doing some crazy stuff,"" he teases. With his music though, Karan says he’s just ""trying to go with the flow"". He name-checks Burna Boy and Wizkid as artists who he feels have a sound that ""is so clean"". But his own approach will remain pretty chilled out. ""I will never plan things… it just happens. ""That’s the best way to do anything in life.""

250,First peek at room behind Buckingham Palace's famous balcony,"Instead of that famous view looking up at the Buckingham Palace balcony, visitors for the first time will be able to look down from the inside. After five years of renovations, the east wing of the palace has been carefully restored and on a trial basis is open to paying customers from next week. But they won't be able to step out on to the balcony itself - and when you visit you can see why. It's surprisingly narrow and the railings are below waist height, in a way that would send any health and safety officers into a royal panic. But looking through the windows - and what royal author Robert Hardman has called ""the most famous net curtains in the world"" - you can see the view from the perspective of the King and Queen, Prince William and Catherine. What's surprising from this vantage point is how clearly you can see the crowds of tourists below, you can really see people's faces. There's also the curiosity of the change of perspective - looking out across the pink gravel of the courtyard and towards the Mall, rather than the usual view from outside the gates looking in. To get to the balcony the royals go through the Centre Room, elaborately decorated in a Chinese style, and now open to the public for the first time since this wing was built 175 years ago. A huge lamp fitting hangs down, decorated in the style of a lily, and the walls are covered in Chinese-themed art.  The royal world loves its acronyms. So Buckingham Palace is ""BP"" and Kensington Palace is ""KP"" - but this enthusiasm for Chinese and oriental art is connected to another BP. That's the Brighton Pavilion, because building the east wing of Buckingham Palace was funded by Queen Victoria selling off the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. That seaside retreat was a fusion of Asian styles and racy regency fashions and, always keen on recycling, the 19th Century royals removed the Chinese and Japanese-themed furniture and art and put it into Buckingham Palace. That included the fixtures and fittings, such as doors, gilded curtain poles and a fireplace, as well as ornamental porcelain pagodas. The introduction of tours to this previously private section of the palace is part of a broader ambition to make royal residences more open to the public. The east wing, getting its first tourists, is the main facade of the palace, where tourists gather outside to watch Changing of the Guard - it's the view you see on the postcards. It's not cheap to look round, costing £75, but has already completely sold out for this year. And this summer's inaugural visitors will be in guided groups of 20, separate to the existing more general tour of the palace's state rooms. In this more intimate version of the tour, none of the items on show are roped off from visitors. The furniture doesn't have 'keep off' signs. It makes it feel more like a living building rather than a museum, but there's no escaping the gradual gift-shopification of the palace.  It's a mix of an historic setting for grand events, an office block and a tourist attraction, but at the moment it still seems a way off from being where any of the royals are likely to live. Visiting royals don't stay here either any more. During their recent state visit the Emperor and Empress of Japan stayed in Claridge's Hotel. There is an ongoing £369m project to renovate the palace complex, not just the gilded surfaces, but the basics of the plumbing and wiring on what is a huge set of ageing buildings. Once you step away from the glitzy state rooms you never seem far from scaffolding and repair works. Renovating the east wing alone meant removing and conserving 3,500 separate items, including historic furniture and works of art. And the tour only includes only a relatively small part of that wing. But the sell-out tours show the public demand and while there will be art lovers among the visitors, people will also be coming to see for themselves something they might have watched on television or imagined through the Crown. They can stand in the elegant Yellow Drawing room, used for many audiences and the setting of a Christmas broadcast by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Or visitors can look out of the window at the quadrangle below, where Sir Keir Starmer pulled up last week when he went to meet the King after winning the general election. There's plenty of royal bling on show in the long corridors, but it's the sense of seeing behind the scenes in the palace that will draw people. And when they look out through the long balcony windows, they might resist the temptation to give a little wave.",2024-07-10 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn38z155yrpo,"Sean Coughlan,",2024-07-10 00:09:53,
251,Man caught smuggling 100 snakes in his trousers,"A man tried to smuggle more than 100 live snakes into mainland China by stuffing them in his trousers, according to custom officials. The unnamed traveller was stopped after passing through the ""nothing to declare"" gate at the crossing between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and the city of Shenzhen, officials said. Upon inspection, he had 104 snakes in “six canvas drawstring bags"" inside his trousers, a statement from China Customs said. “Each bag was found to contain living snakes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and colours,” it added. Video released by Chinese customs shows a pair of agents peering into transparent plastic bags filled with live red, pink and white snakes.  They were mostly small, but it is a large and squirmy haul of slithering reptiles for anyone to carry in their trousers.  Strict biosecurity and disease control laws forbid people from bringing in non-native species without permission into the country. “Those who break the rules will be… held liable in accordance with the law,” the customs authority said, without specifying the man’s punishment. In 2023 at the same crossing point, a woman was stopped trying to smuggle in five snakes hidden inside her bra.

252,What is Nato and which countries are members?,"Sir Keir Starmer is attending the Nato summit in Washington DC - his first international trip since becoming prime minister. In a speech to mark the 75th anniversary of the military alliance on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said Nato was ""more powerful than ever"" and that it faced a ""pivotal moment"", with the war between Russia and Ukraine.  Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France.  Its founding treaty was signed in Washington DC, and leaders of Nato countries marked the anniversary on the first day of the summit, which is taking place between 9 - 11 July. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato's primary purpose, external was to block expansion in Europe by the Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it., external Nato does not have an army of its own, but member countries can take collective military action in response to crises.  The alliance supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004, external. It also coordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises, external. Biden forcefully defends Nato as he hosts summit leaders Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America, including the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey.  After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries joined: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Both had applied to join in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, having been neutral for decades. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia also hope to join Nato.  How Sweden and Finland went from neutral to Nato Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, Nato said that Ukraine could eventually join, external.  After Russia's invasion, Ukraine's President Zelensky asked for his country to be admitted as soon as possible.  Outgoing Nato secretary-general Mr Stoltenberg previously said it was ""inevitable"" that Ukraine would become a member, but not until its war with Russia ends.  Outgoing Nato boss Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" Since July 2023, the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group, external has been coordinating efforts to give Ukraine weapons and training to defend itself against Russia.  Nato is proposing to take over that role by creating a $100bn fund, external to support Ukraine over the next five years. In 2022, Nato said the Russian invasion of Ukraine posed the ""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"", external. Nato has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country, for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia.  However, individual members have supplied arms to help Ukraine defend itself.  The German research organisation the Kiel Institute, external says the US has allocated 50.4bn euros (£42.6bn) for military support to Ukraine, while European countries - Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK - have allocated 32bn euros (£27bn).  The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have provided anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles. Nato countries are supplying Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine Speaking at the Washington summit, President Joe Biden said the US would partner with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Romania to donate Patriot missile batteries and other systems to bolster Ukraine's air defences.  This follows Russian air attacks across Ukraine on 8 July which destroyed a children's hospital in Kyiv and killed 43 people across the country, according to officials. President Zelensky has spent months pleading with his Western allies for more weapons.  Earlier in 2024, supplies of US munitions dried up after a bill to give more military support to Ukraine was delayed for several months. European weapons makers were unable to fill the gap.  The US is letting two Nato countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, send US-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. The first planes are expected to arrive later this summer. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? In 2023, Nato commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks anywhere in the Arctic and north Atlantic, central Europe, or the Mediterranean region.  It has increased the number of troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000.  The alliance has also bolstered its defences on Russia's borders with eight battlegroups, external. Nato asks every member country to spend at least 2% of its national income on defence, and 23 of them are projected to meet that target in 2024. Only three did in 2014. The biggest spenders (in proportion to the size of their economies) are the US and countries close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic Republics. Nato's European members and Canada collectively increased their defence spending by an estimated 9% in 2023, and are forecast to increase it by another 18% in 2024, external. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak committed the UK to increasing its military budget to 2.5% of national income from the current 2.3%.  Speaking on the way to the Washington summit, Sir Keir Starmer insisted his Labour government will honour that pledge.  However, the new armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, has not said when the target will be met. When he was US President, Donald Trump pushed European Nato members to boost their defence spending.  During the current presidential election campaign, Mr Trump - who is the presumptive Republican nominee - warned that if he was re-elected, he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough. Mr Stoltenberg said his suggestion ""undermines all of our security"". At a campaign rally on Tuesday, Mr Trump told supporters that Nato countries were now contributing ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" more because he had warned them: ""No, I will not protect you from Russia"" unless they paid more to the alliance.

253,Lena Dunham pulls out of directing Polly Pocket,"Lena Dunham has dropped out of directing a film about the Polly Pocket dolls, saying she didn't think she could replicate what Greta Gerwig achieved with Barbie. The actor and director told The New Yorker: ""I'm not going to make the Polly Pocket movie. I wrote a script, and I was working on it for three years."" Dunham, who created and starred in US TV comedy Girls, was enlisted to direct the Polly Pocket film in 2021. It was also announced that Emily In Paris star Lily Collins would play the lead doll. Robbie Brenner, the producer who runs toy company Mattel's film division, told Variety last year that the script was ""great"" and Dunham ""is so collaborative and rolls up her sleeves and really likes to roll around in notes and listen"". However, Dunham has now said she would struggle to put her own personal stamp on it in the way Gerwig did with Barbie. Barbie took $1.44bn (£1.2bn) at the box office, making Gerwig the most successful solo female director ever. ""I think Greta did this incredible feat, which was to make this thing that was literally candy to so many different kinds of people and was perfectly and divinely Greta,"" Dunham added. ""And I just - I felt like, unless I can do it that way, I’m not going to do it. ""I don’t think I have that in me. ""I feel like the next movie I make needs to feel like a movie that I absolutely have to make. No-one but me could make it. ""And I did think other people could make Polly Pocket."" Polly Pocket is just one of the films Mattel has in the pipeline following Barbie's success.  Other projects include Barney, produced by Get Out actor Daniel Kaluuya, and Hot Wheels, produced by Star Wars and Star Trek director JJ Abrams. Despite Dunham's withdrawal, a Mattel spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter they still hope to make the Polly Pocket film. Dunham is currently working on Too Much, a Netflix series loosely based on her life, with her husband musician Luis Felber. The plot follows the lead character, played by Megan Stalter, meeting a punk musician, played by Will Sharpe, in London after a break-up in New York. Dunham said she didn’t want to star in it herself because of the body shaming she experienced after appearing as Hannah Horvath in Girls.  ""I knew from the very beginning I would not be the star of it,"" she said. ""First, because I had seen Meg Stalter’s work, and I was very inspired by her. She’s unbelievable. ""I also think that I was not willing to have another experience like what I’d experienced around Girls at this point in my life. ""Physically, I was just not up for having my body dissected again. ""It was a hard choice - not to cast Meg, because I knew I wanted Meg - but to admit that to myself.""",2024-07-10 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9x9d72nzo,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-10 14:09:53,

The man was shot after approaching the car the officer was sitting in and tapping the window with a gun.  The deputy fired several times, hitting the suspect in the mouth. A second deputy also opened fire, but did not hit the man, police said. Justice Sotomayor’s home is not believed to have been a deliberately targeted. The suspected carjacker, named in charging documents as Kentrell Flowers, 18, is being treated in hospital and faces carjacking and firearms charges. The two deputies have not been identified. Court documents said Mr Flowers had emerged from a silver minivan - which had been stolen earlier in the evening - and approached the officers' car.  Court documents said the two officers were wearing US Marshals branded polo shirts and T-shirts during the incident.  The teenage suspect was charged with armed carjacking, carrying a pistol without a licence, and possession of a large capacity magazine. Magazines with over 10-round capacity are illegal in Washington DC. An investigation into the alleged attempted carjacking is underway, but police said there was no indication the suspect knew who he had approached, or that he was near Justice Sotomayor's home. The driver of the minivan fled the scene, with the minivan found abandoned later.  Vehicle thefts and carjackings were a serious issue in the US capital, but there has been a 43% decrease in such incidents this year, Metro police figures show.

Take, for example, her quarter-final win against Elina Svitolina. It took just 61 minutes, with Rybakina hitting an impressive 28 winners. The Kazakh world number four will bid for a second Wimbledon final in three years when she faces 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova in the second semi-final on Centre Court on Thursday. ""This is something I want to achieve, I want to do again,"" said Rybakina. ""Everybody wants to win. Everybody's going to fight."" Rybakina arrived at Wimbledon with limited grass-court preparation, having retired from her second-round match at the Berlin Open with abdominal pain and then withdrawing from Eastbourne. But she has been in formidable form, dropping just one set - against Laura Siegemund in the second round - and extending her impressive SW19 record to 19 wins from 21 matches. Her win percentage of 90.5 is bettered only by Ann Jones and Steffi Graf in the Wimbledon women's singles in the Open era. ""I think that's an amazing statistic,"" Rybakina told BBC Sport. ""When I first played on grass I didn't feel comfortable, but my coach told me 'you were born for this, you just need to keep going'.'"" He proved correct, with Rybakina clinching the title on just her second main-draw appearance. She has moved through the gears this year in a draw that saw rival Aryna Sabalenka withdraw before her first match and top two seeds Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff lose in the third and fourth rounds respectively. So who - if anyone - can stop Rybakina this year?

However, the pair have yet to meet on a grass court. The Czech began the season as the world number 10, but she has slipped down the rankings since after being hampered by illness and a back injury. Krejcikova is the only other Grand Slam singles champion left in the draw, but she has not played in a major semi-final since her French Open triumph in 2021. Rybakina will also know that Krejcikova has produced numerous shocks this fortnight, upsetting 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and in-form Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals.

Italian Paolini is a late bloomer. She had never reached the second week of a Grand Slam until six weeks ago when she stormed to the French Open final. Incredibly, she had not won a main draw match at Wimbledon until this summer's tournament. She beat world number 12 Madison Keys in the fourth round before taking just 58 minutes to dismantle 19th seed Emma Navarro in the quarter-finals. Her opponent Vekic is also appearing in a first Wimbledon semi-final. Just a month ago, the 28-year-old Croat was on the verge of quitting tennis, having struggled with a run of injuries. Now she is on the best Grand Slam run of her career, having beaten qualifier Lulu Sun to reach a first major semi-final. Briton Neal Skupski won the men's doubles title last year alongside Wesley Koolhof There is guaranteed to be a British man in the men's doubles final, with Liverpool's Neal Skupski and Colchester-born Henry Patten facing one another in the semi-finals on Thursday.   Skupski won last year's tournament alongside Dutchman Wesley Koolhof but is now partnering New Zealander Michael Venus. Patten is paired with Finland's Harri Heliovaara, with the British duo set to meet in the second match on Court One. In the other semi-final, top seeds Marcel Granollers of Argentina and Spain's Horacio Zeballos face Australian duo Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson.

257,Vingegaard outsprints Pogacar to win epic Tour stage,"Both Vingegaard (left) and Pogacar are looking for their third Tour de France win overall Denmark's Jonas Vingegaard won stage 11 of the Tour de France following a sprint to the line with rival and overall leader Tadej Pogacar. Defending champion Vingegaard, of Visma-Lease a Bike, edged out Pogacar of UAE-Team-Emirates as the pair raced for the line after several climbs on the 211km stage to Le Lioran in France's Massif Central region. Pogacar remains in the yellow jersey and is now one minute six seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, who was third on the stage, with Vingegaard a further eight seconds behind. When Slovenian Pogacar attacked with 32km to go he pulled away from the rest of the field but Vingegaard reeled him back in on the penultimate climb. Denmark's Vingegaard, 27, suffered a major crash in early April which left him with multiple serious injuries and he said through tears after the stage: ""It is very emotional for me, coming back from the crash... ""It means a lot and all the things I went through in the last three months... I would never have been able to do this without my family."" On Monday's rest day Pogacar had suggested that Vingegaard was ""a little afraid"" of him and his team, following Sunday's stage nine in which Vingegaard chose only to follow Pogacar's wheel. But Vingegaard was the first to launch the sprint on Tuesday as they accelerated to the line, and stayed ahead of the straining Pogacar, 25. ""Now we can all see it's a fair fight and [Vingegaard] is in top shape,"" said Pogacar afterwards.  ""He beat me really good on the line. Let's continue to do it like this.""

Slovenia's Primoz Roglic of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe was tracking Evenepoel before crashing late on when his rear wheel slid out on a tight left-hand downhill bend, but as it was inside 3km to the finish he was given the same time as Evenepoel. Britain's record-breaking Tour stage winner Mark Cavendish of Astana-Qazaqstan finished near the back of the field, 41 minutes behind the leaders.

255,Trial told dying girl offered prayer not medicine,"Members of an Australian religious group have gone on trial accused of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl by denying her medical care and offering prayer instead. Elizabeth Struhs was found dead at a home in Toowoomba - about 125km (78 mi) west of Brisbane - in January 2022, after she had allegedly gone without insulin for several days. Prosecutors say the sect shunned the use of medicine and trusted God to “heal” the child - “extreme beliefs” which had already almost ended Elizabeth’s life in similar circumstances three years before. The girl's parents are among the 14 defendants, all of whom have refused lawyers.  They have also all opted to enter no pleas on the charges. Formally, the court considers that a plea of not guilty. Two men - Elizabeth’s father Jason Struhs, 52, and the religious group’s leader Brendan Stevens, 62 - have been charged with murder, with prosecutors saying they knew the group's actions would likely kill Elizabeth. The girl's mother, Kerrie Struhs, 49, brother Zachary Struhs, 21, and ten others - aged 22 to 67 - are accused of manslaughter. As the trial began at the Queensland Supreme Court on Wednesday, the group filed in one by one, clad in prison clothes, taking their allocated positions in a courtroom specifically modified to fit them all. Due to the complexity and notoriety of the case, the trial is being heard by a judge only - no jury - and is expected to last for around three months. When opening her case, prosecutor Caroline Marco said Elizabeth had been an ""intelligent, spiritual child"". ""But [she was] too young to understand the dire consequences of her parents' decision... which she ultimately paid for with her own life.” Ms Marco alleged that in early January 2022, both parents made the decision to first reduce the amount of insulin given to their daughter, and then withdraw it completely. Members of the sect then gathered at the home to pray, she said, and it was “visible to all who saw her” that Elizabeth’s health was in danger. But there was “no attempt” to get a doctor. She later died after having ""suffered for days"" , said the prosecutor.  The court heard Mrs Struhs had only been out of prison for a few weeks, after being convicted of failing to provide insulin to her daughter on another occasion in 2019. That time, the girl spent a month in hospital after medical treatment was eventually sought by her father. Jason Struhs previously had not agreed with the group's beliefs, the judge was told, but had been baptised while his wife was in prison. “He knew if he did not change he would lose his family and wife so pushed aside convictions of faith he once held, and joined them,"" Ms Marco said. Over the course of the trial, the court would hear from 60 witnesses including one of the Struhs' daughters, who is estranged from the family, Ms Marco said. The evidence, she added, would paint a picture of a small and “insular” religious group which centred around Brendan Stevens. Prosecutors will continue laying out their arguments on Thursday, after which the defendants will also have the opportunity to address the court. Before the trial began, Justice Martin Burn said stressed that he was obliged to provide sufficient information to ensure they got a fair trial, but could not provide them with legal advice.",2024-07-10 23:09:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c97dq22nj0lo,"Simon Atkinson,",2024-07-10 09:09:54,
256,From Weston to Euro 2024 final - Watkins' 'unbelievable' moment,"This video can not be played Watkins score late winner for England ""I've been waiting for that moment for weeks,"" said Ollie Watkins afterwards - and boy did he take it. With the clock about to hit 90:00 in England's Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands, with the score at 1-1 in Dortmund, the ball fell to the striker from Devon, who was still playing in the English Football League just over four years ago at the age of 24. The Aston Villa man turned Stefan de Vrij and hammered a shot into the bottom corner for one of the most important England goals ever scored. Rewind nine years and he had just finished a loan spell at non-league Weston-super-Mare from League Two Exeter City. Asked after his Dortmund heroics whether he could have imagined this at the time, he said: ""You can dream but I am a realist. I was just focused on getting back into the first team at Exeter. ""I didn't dream about that to be honest. I can't lie and say I did. Scoring for England is amazing but I didn't think I'd do it in a tournament like that."" Watkins' winning goal more than justified Gareth Southgate's decision to choose him to replace England's all-time top scorer Harry Kane, with nine minutes to go. He came on alongside Cole Palmer, who set up his goal. ""I was wondering when the changes were going to happen. The changes were right and they were perfect,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Radio 5 Live. Former Brentford striker Watkins had only played 20 minutes at a major tournament before this, in the group stage against Denmark, having been left out of the Euro 2020 and 2022 World Cup squads. ""When I was on the bench I said to [sub keeper] Dean Henderson, 'I can make a difference today and need to get on'. I took my chance, scored it and now we are in the final. One last game,"" he said. That game is against Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final - as England bid to be European champions for the first time in men's football. This video can not be played 'The best feeling ever!' - Watkins on scoring England winner Unlike many England players, Watkins started his career lower in the football pyramid - at Exeter City. ""He had the perfect attitude, the perfect character and physical ability. He had all the boxes ticked yet, at 17, 18, 19 years old he never played as well as he should have done,"" said Paul Tisdale, Watkins' first manager at Exeter. At the age of 18, mostly playing on the wing, Watkins had made four first-team appearances for City before being sent on loan to Weston-super-Mare in the Conference South, the sixth tier. He scored 10 goals in 18 starts there - and broke into the Exeter team, as a striker. ""Suddenly the engine turned on. I've never seen a player have a quantum shift in their output as much as Ollie did,"" said Tisdale. He left for Championship Brentford in 2017 for £1.8m having scored 26 goals in 78 appearances for Exeter. Another 49 goals followed in 143 games for the Bees before he became the most expensive Championship player ever when he joined Aston Villa for £28m three years later. In this squad, only Ivan Toney - his rival for the spot to replace Kane late in games - has played more EFL games.  League games only (including play-offs) Watkins has kicked on at Villa with 70 goals in 169 games, hitting 19 Premier League goals last season to take his club into the Champions League. Dean Smith, who managed him at Brentford and Villa, said: ""I look at him now - he has become more of a selfish player, which is a good thing. ""His biggest strength could be his biggest weakness. He could beat himself up over things but it would also drive him. ""His emotional control now allows him to accept 'I will miss chances but I’ll be ready for the next one'."" Just last month Watkins said: ""Even when I first went to Villa, I'd just been bought for £30m and I was still unsure whether I deserved to be there.  ""I hadn't done it in the Premier League, so I would say there was a bit of that before. But now I'm in a really good place. ""I had a really good year, got the most assists in the league, scored a lot of goals and people still weren't including me in their squads to come to the Euros. ""Everyone has their own opinion, but I don't feel like I have that big profile where I'm talked about. Or where if I was left out of the squad, people would be like: 'Oh, I can't believe they didn't pick Ollie Watkins.' ""I'm happy I'm here now."" And so is Gareth Southgate. ""Ollie has trained every day and been ready to play, as the whole group has been,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new players in the group. Half have not been to a tournament but they have bonded so well, got each other's back and tonight was a good example of that."" Watkins' goal - timed at 89:59 - was the latest winning goal scored in a European Championship or World Cup semi-final, excluding extra time. It came with one of only 10 touches Watkins has had in the tournament. ""We talk about being ready,"" said Kane. ""We're a big team at being ready.  ""When it matters, you might get five minutes, one minute, but you can make a difference, you can win us a tournament. He's been waiting, he's been patient.  ""What he did was outstanding and he deserves it."" Ex-England striker Ian Wright was impressed watching the game for ITV. ""This is what Ollie Watkins does. This is the exact attitude I would want to have,"" he said.  ""You want Cole Palmer to come on and hit a pass that is perfect. In the moment, get back to the basics. It was absolutely perfect. Nobody did that to those defenders all night. They had an easy ride until he came on. ""Unbelievable moment. That's what you have come on to do - just take a shot. What's the worst that can happen? Ollie Watkins has done brilliantly. ""He's waited for his opportunity and he's done it. Now we're into the final. It's just amazing.""",2024-07-10 23:09:54,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c134enzzg26o,Emlyn Begley,2024-07-10 22:53:54,
260,England to face Spain in Euro 2024 final - what to expect,"This video can not be played Watkins score late goal for England England will face Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final in Berlin after beating the Netherlands 2-1 in the semi-final. The game, with a 20:00 BST kick-off, will be shown live on BBC One and the iPlayer, with commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. ITV will also show the final. The Three Lions are hoping to go one step further than at Euro 2020 when they lost the final on penalties to Italy. But in their way are the best team at Euro 2024 so far, three-time champions Spain. This will be England's third match against Spain at a European Championship - and the Three Lions triumphed in the previous two. In the 1980 group stages, England beat Spain 2-1 in Naples - although both sides went out. And in 1996 the sides met in the last 16 at Wembley, with England winning on penalties after a goalless draw. Their only other meeting at a major tournament was the 1950 World Cup, with Spain winning 1-0 in a group game in Rio de Janeiro. England did win the most recent tie, a 3-2 victory in Seville in the 2018 Nations League, but only won two of their 10 meetings before that (excluding penalties). In international and club finals, though, Spanish teams take some stopping - with 22 successes in a row since 2001. The national team have won their past three major tournament finals, while the last nine Champions League finals and 10 Europa League finals involving a Spanish side and a foreign team have all ended in La Liga victory. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 France While England were perceived to be in the 'easy half' of the Euro 2024 draw, Spain's route to the final could not have been more difficult. In the group stage, they beat 2018 World Cup semi-finalists Croatia and defending European champions Italy. Then in the quarter-finals they beat hosts Germany - who were arguably the second-best team in the Euros - and in the semi-finals eliminated 2018 world champions France. Not only that but they have won all six games without the need for penalties. No team have managed that in one European Championship before. They are also the top scorers in the tournament with 13 goals. Spain also have history in the Euros, winning it in 1964, 2008 and 2012. They are bidding to become the first nation to win it four times. This video can not be played 'The next superstar' - pundits praise Yamal If Spain win, this tournament is likely to go down in history as the introduction of Lamine Yamal - in the way Pele took the 1958 World Cup by storm. The 16-year-old Barcelona player became the youngest European Championship player ever when he started their opening game against Croatia. In the semi-final his stunning effort into the top scorer made him the youngest goalscorer at a Euros or World Cup, breaking Pele's record. He also broke Pele's record of the youngest player in a semi-final in either tournament. Not only has he been playing - and scored one of the goals of the tournament - but statistically he has generally been one of the best players too, with three assists and 13 chances created. Yamal plays on the right wing and on the left has been one of the tournament's other stars, Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams, who is only 21 himself. The pair, who have become close friends, celebrate birthdays in the two days leading up to the final. Luis de la Fuente's side also have the current leader in the Golden Boot race: Leipzig midfielder Dani Olmo. Despite only starting two games he has scored three goals - level with four other players - but his two assists are the tie-breaker.  Another contender for the player of the tournament is Spain's Manchester City defensive midfielder Rodri. The 28-year-old, who was born on the day England knocked Spain out of Euro '96, has only lost one of his past 79 games for club and country. Former England striker Alan Shearer: ""They've got everything you need to be successful and that's the reason they've won every single game at this tournament."" Chris Sutton: ""It is hard to see anybody touching them, they seem to be on a different level to anybody else in this tournament."" Micah Richards: ""The worries I had about this Spanish team, they answered them against France - how they can adapt to situations and when you have pace on the wings you always have a chance. They look really balanced and I think they are favourites.""",2024-07-10 23:09:55,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crg58gegz31o,Emlyn Begley,2024-07-10 23:09:55,
261,Atkinson makes speedy claim to be England's future,"This video can not be played Atkinson takes seven wickets on Test debut Life comes at you fast and Gus Atkinson bowls faster. For all of the attention and emotion generated by James Anderson’s final appearance in Test cricket, it was Atkinson who eased into the slipstream and hinted at England’s tomorrow. How perfect it would have been had Anderson presented Atkinson with his cap on a moody Wednesday morning at Lord’s – that honour went to debuting wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, with Atkinson welcomed to the England fold by Surrey team-mate Ollie Pope. Instead, Atkinson had to settle for taking over from Anderson, literally replacing him in the attack 10 overs into the first morning of the first Test against West Indies, and responded with the best figures by an England bowler on debut for 29 years.  His name was on the famous honours board before the day was out. “I walked in after and the board is right where I’m sitting, so it’s very special to see it up there,” Atkinson told BBC Sport. “I’m very proud. I don’t think it’s really sunk in yet.” On an occasion all about Anderson, the stars (and dark clouds) had aligned to present what seemed the perfect conditions to end a legendary career with one final mesmeric spell. Atkinson makes speedy claim to be England's future Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS Podcast: Atkinson stars as Anderson begins farewell Seldom do home crowds cheer quite so loudly when England win the toss and choose to field, but the Lord’s spectators recognised the grey sky and floodlights were prime Jimmy material. There was a moving tribute video played on the big screen to England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, he led his team out for the national anthems and the entire Anderson family were on hand to ring the five-minute bell. But this stage would not be filled by a greatest hits set, rather a thrilling debut album, one that will be music to the ears of the England hierarchy following the decision to pull Anderson from the dancefloor. Not for one second is anyone trying to claim Atkinson is a better bowler than Anderson now, or that he will be in the future. England, though, have nailed their colours to pace, consistently telling us that Test bowlers are most likely to be successful when they get up above 85mph. And, for all of the encouragement offered to Anderson and Chris Woakes in the early going, West Indies openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis were relatively untroubled by bowling in the low 80s. This video can not be played Vaughan analyses Atkinson's fine first-innings performance That all changed when Atkinson pushed down the slope at the Pavilion End in the 11th over. Quick steps, short delivery stride, high arm. His first delivery hit 89mph and his second, at 88mph, drew the usually obdurate Brathwaite into a wild hack and a drag-on to the stumps. “I just wanted to get it down there in a good area. It wasn’t exactly where I wanted to bowl it, but it came off well, so I can’t complain,” said Atkinson. “It was a bit of relief and nice to get the first one out of the way quickly.” Atkinson’s average speed of 87.86 in that opening over is the second-fastest by an England bowler since such data has been measured, bettered only by Steven Finn in Bangladesh in 2010. Slippery and skiddy, Atkinson made light of the slow pitch with a full length and a scrambled seam. In his third over, he added the wicket of Kirk McKenzie, drawn into an edge to second slip. Overall, his opening spell of five overs contained four maidens and the two runs he did concede were from a misfield. Tellingly it was Atkinson, rather than Anderson, who was asked to begin proceedings after lunch, a decision repaid with a spectacular triple-wicket maiden. Alick Athanaze poked to first slip and a squared-up Jason Holder was held at third for a golden duck. Joshua da Silva prevented Atkinson becoming only the fourth man to take a hat-trick on Test debut, but next ball inside-edged to give Smith his first catch as a Test keeper. By this point, Atkinson had become the fifth England debutant to take a five-wicket haul in the two years Ben Stokes has been captain, following just two in the 13 previous years. After Alzarri Joseph chipped to mid-on and Shamar Joseph got in an ugly tangle to be caught at backward point, Atkinson finished with 7-45, the best figures by an England bowler on Test bow since Dominic Cork on the same ground against the same opponents in 1995. When Anderson trapped last man Jayden Seales lbw to leave West Indies 121 all out, the crowd sang Jimmy’s name, but it was Atkinson who led England from the field. Those who know Atkinson say he is quiet, to the point of being shy. After he showed his well-earned match ball to the crowd as they applauded him off, he dropped it. His father Ed was in the Lord’s Long Room, just as he was in the team huddle for the cap presentation at the beginning of the day, alongside Atkinson’s brother, sister and aunt. His mother Caroline passed away after a car crash four years ago. “He’s a big cricket fan, to make him proud and my family proud is very special,” said Atkinson. “Walking through the Long Room at the end and seeing him there was pretty cool.” At 26, Atkinson is something of a late developer. He did not make his Surrey debut until the age of 22 and this is his first first-class match at Lord’s. “Gus Atkinson looks the real deal,” said former England captain Michael Vaughan. “He bowled with good zip and pace at the first time of asking. “We know England are looking for pace. If you want to win a five-match series against India or Australia, you're probably going to need five quicks that you can rotate. “The hope for England by next summer is that they've got a group of bowlers that you don't know who you're going to leave out.” Life comes at you fast. Very soon Anderson will be England’s past. Atkinson has made a speedy claim to be a big part of their future.

273,Israeli army 'failed in mission' to protect kibbutz from Hamas attack,"Israel's defence minister has called for a state inquiry into what led to the Hamas attacks on 7 October, as the military admitted it failed in its duty to protect a small community were 101 people were killed. Yoav Gallant made his comments after the first in a series of official Israeli military reports laid bare how the army operated in Kibbutz Be’eri, which is near the Gaza perimeter fence. More residents died at the kibbutz than any other Israeli community on 7 October, after gunmen crossed from Gaza and rampaged through their homes. Mr Gallant said an independent national inquiry was needed to examine the actions of all those in power, including Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, in relation to how Hamas had grown in strength and capability over the past decade. Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn.  It led to the major Israeli military operation in Gaza which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Members of the kibbutz said it was important the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admitted it had failed to protect them and they too are demanding a national inquiry. The report, carried out by a senior military officer, commended the bravery of security personal but said the IDF was not prepared for the extensive infiltration by Hamas and “for the first seven hours of combat, the kibbutz residents defended themselves”. It said: “The inquiry team determined that the IDF failed in its mission to protect the residents of Kibbutz Be'eri.” Other findings included: The report also focused on the command given to a tank to shell a house in which 13 hostages were being held. No personal blame was attributed to Brigadier General Barak Hiram, commander of the 99th Infantry Division who was found to have acted professionally along with other senior officers in “complex and difficult circumstances.” The report said: “The tank fire towards the area near the house was carried out professionally, with a joint decision made by commanders from all the security organisations after careful consideration and a situational assessment was made, with the intent to apply pressure to the terrorists and save the civilians held hostage inside.” Brig-Gen Hiram is soon due to take command of the Gaza Division. The report’s authors concluded that as far as they could assess, no civilians inside the house were harmed by tank-shell fire, except for what they called “an isolated incident outside the building where two civilians were injured by shrapnel”. It said: “The team determined that most of the hostages were likely murdered by the terrorists, and further inquiries and reviews of additional findings are necessary.” The IDF’s Chief of the General Staff accepted all the conclusions of the report and ordered they be integrated into future operational plans. Hamas killed one in 10 of the 1,000 residents of Be’eri on 7 October in a rampage that started after dawn and lasted for hours. Sharon Sharabi, whose two brothers Yossi and Eli were taken into Gaza as hostages, was briefed earlier on the report and said he had learned nothing new from the official findings. “There was a command failure here. This is a difficult and bad picture,” he said. Yossi, 53, has been declared dead [by Israeli authorities] and the fate of Eli, who would now be 52, is unknown. Mr Sharabi said: “It cannot be beautified in any way. No investigation they may try to do can make it rosy. It’s impossible.” A statement issued by Kibbutz Be’eri residents said it was of great importance to them that the IDF had asked for their forgiveness for not protecting them from what they called “an unparalleled attack of evil”. “The failure of the army has been burned into our bodies and in our hearts for nine months,” their statement said. Residents said they still had not received satisfactory answers to why the army did not enter the kibbutz, nor had any explanation been given yet for the intelligence failure that allowed Hamas to launch their mass assault undetected. They also called for a national [state] inquiry, which prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been unwilling to initiate. Thursday’s report is expected to be the first in a series of IDF probes into how the 7 October attacks were dealt with in various parts of southern Israel where Hamas attacked.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9x8wjxgz1ko,"Nick Beake,",2024-07-11 19:11:15,
272,Which Democrats are calling for Joe Biden to step aside?,"A growing number of Democrats are calling on Joe Biden to end his presidential re-election bid and step aside for a younger contender. Concerns over his poor debate performance have spread over the past fortnight among politicians, donors and others within the party. The 81-year-old has defiantly declared he is ""not going anywhere"". But the pressure is mounting as he continues to lose ground in the polls against Republican rival Donald Trump. It began five days after the June 27 debate with Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, who said that it was time for Mr Biden to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"". Mr Doggett, 77, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said he respected ""all that President Biden has achieved"" but that the Democrat had failed to ""effectively defend his many accomplishments"" on the debate stage. He has since been joined by other House of Representatives colleagues: It took just under two weeks from the debate for the first Democrat senator to call for Mr Biden to drop out. Peter Welch, of Vermont, told the Washington Post: ""We need him to put us first, as he has done before,"" he said. ""I urge him to do it now."" Other prominent figures have also joined the growing chorus: Senior Democrats, including party leaders in Washington, have held their fire and straddled the fence on whether Mr Biden should continue his 2024 bid. Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, declined to directly answer whether she wanted him to keep running. She did so on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the president's favourite news programme.  ""I want him to do whatever he decides to do,"" she said, adding that ""time is running short"" for him to make that call. Her replacement as House Democratic chief, Hakeem Jeffries, has said he is having ""candid, comprehensive and clear-eyed"" conversations with his members and that he will meet his leadership team to discuss next steps. But he rejected suggestions that Mr Biden had become a political liability for House Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has publicly said he is ""for Joe"" but, per Axios, is privately signalling to donors that he is open to replacing Mr Biden. Many politicians have carefully parsed their words, expressing respect for the president's accomplishments in office while noting that his poor polling and  concerning public appearances raise significant questions. Montana's Jon Tester and Ohio's Sherrod Brown are two of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election. While Mr Brown has largely dodged questions on the topic, Mr Tester says Mr Biden ""has got to prove"" that he is up to the job. Colleagues have echoed those concerns. Patty Murray, of Washington state, said Mr Biden ""must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump"". Michael Bennet, of Colorado, warned that Mr Trump was on track to win ""by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House"". Two high-profile House members, California's Adam Schiff and Maryland's Jamie Raskin, as well as Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, have also publicly aired their doubts since the 27 June debate. But the president is not without his backers. Vice-President Kamala Harris has not wavered in standing by her boss, as have potential replacement candidates such as Gavin Newsom, California's governor, and his Michigan and Maryland contemporaries Gretchen Whitmer and Wes Moore. The powerful Congressional Black Caucus, which represents about one quarter of House Democrats, reaffirmed its backing for Mr Biden this week. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has done the same, though some of its members are reportedly not on board. Also standing by Mr Biden, and enthusiastically so, are outspoken figures on the Hill such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York congresswoman, two-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania senator.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngd0dve6lo,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-11 19:11:15,
271,India tycoon’s son to marry after months of festivities,"After months of lavish celebrations spread across the world, the wedding ceremony of the son of Asia's richest man is set to take place on Friday. Anant Ambani, son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, will tie the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant. The four-day wedding extravaganza in Mumbai city is the final stop in a string of lavish parties the family has hosted since March.  The events, which have already featured performances by popstars like Rihanna and Justin Bieber, have captured the world's attention.  But it has also led to backlash - city dwellers have complained of traffic snarls, while others have questioned the ostentatious display of wealth at the seemingly never-ending celebrations.  Mukesh Ambani, 66, is at present the world's 10th richest man with a net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes. Reliance Industries, founded by his father in 1966, is a massive conglomerate that operates in sectors ranging from petroleum and retail, to financial services and telecoms. Anant Ambani is the youngest of his three children, all of whom are on the board of Reliance Industries. The 29-year-old is involved in Reliance's energy businesses and is on the board of Reliance Foundation. On Friday, the couple will get married in a traditional Hindu ceremony at the Jio World Convention Centre.  Reports say the family will host a grand reception through the weekend, before a final reception for their household staff on Monday. Rumours on the internet suggest that Adele could be performing at the wedding, but the family has not confirmed this.  Mumbai police have labelled the wedding a ""public event"" since it would be attended by several international and Indian VIPs, reports Reuters news agency. The city police has also imposed traffic restrictions around the venue.  From Friday to Monday, roads around the convention centre will be open only for ""event vehicles"" between 13:00 India time (07:30 GMT) to midnight, it said.  Rajan Mehra, CEO of air charter company Club One Air, told Reuters that the family had rented three Falcon-2000 jets to ferry wedding guests to the event. “The guests are coming from all over and each aircraft will make multiple trips across the country,” he said.  The restrictions have sparked anger among the city residents who say they are already struggling with traffic jams and monsoon flooding. The wedding festivities began in March when the family held a three-day pre-wedding party in their home state of Gujarat. Among the 1,200 guests to attend the celebration were international celebrities, politicians, and members of the business world - including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates.  The party started with a performance by Rihanna on the first night. Diljit Dosanjh, the first Punjabi singer to perform at Coachella, took the stage on the second night, while rapper Akon closed the show on the final day of celebrations.  In June, the Ambanis organised another pre-wedding celebration, this time, a luxury cruise from Italy to France. The Backstreet Boys, Katy Perry and Pitbull performed for the 800 guests, which included Bollywood stars and cricketers. Then came the final round of celebrations, which began earlier this week when Bieber landed in Mumbai.  Social media has been flooded with photos and videos of him singing in front of an ecstatic audience. Money was also lavished on constructing 14 temples inside a sprawling complex in Jamnagar to showcase India's cultural heritage and provide a backdrop for the wedding. As part of the celebrations, the Ambanis hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples too. On Wednesday, the family hosted a bhandara - a community feast for underprivileged people. The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them but wedding planners estimate they've already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m]. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Bieber is $10m.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x22w0xl0o,Unknown,2024-07-11 21:11:15,
270,The Shining actress Shelley Duvall dies at 75,"US actress Shelley Duvall, known for films like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville, has died at the age of 75. Her partner Dan Gilroy confirmed the news to The Hollywood Reporter.  ""My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,"" he said, according to the outlet. She died in her sleep of complications from diabetes at her home in Texas, Gilroy said. Duvall's other credits included 1977 drama 3 Women, directed by Robert Altman, for which she won the Cannes Film Festival's best actress award and was nominated for a Bafta. Three years later, she starred as Olive Oyl opposite Robin Williams in Altman's musical version of Popeye. But Duvall fell out of favour in Hollywood and was off screens for two decades, before making her comeback in 2023's The Forest Hills. With her large brown eyes and offbeat charisma, Duvall was a distinctive and compelling presence. She began her career, and her association with Altman, in 1970 dark comedy Brewster McCloud, and the pair reunited for McCabe and Mrs Miller in 1971.  After filming her performance as a woman who falls for a 1930s bank robber in their next movie, Thieves Like Us, Altman told her: ""I knew you were good, but I didn't know you were great."" She said that remark was ""the reason I stuck with it and became an actress"". The director stuck with her, once saying she ""was able to swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic, even beautiful"". Altman cast her again in 1975's Nashville, his satire of US society, politics and country music. Their next collaboration, 3 Women, saw Duvall play a talkative, trend-following health spa attendant. The Guardian's Anne Billson ranked it as her best role, and ""quite simply one of the greatest performances of the 1970s"". Meanwhile, also in 1977, Duvall memorably played Pam, a Rolling Stone reporter who went on a date with Woody Allen's Alvy in Annie Hall. Her best-known role was perhaps Wendy, the wife of Jack Nicholson's terrifying hotel caretaker in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror classic The Shining. Filming was an ordeal. ""I had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week,"" she once recalled. After that, Duvall's film roles included Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits and Roxanne with Steve Martin. She also set up her own production companies, and made and hosted beloved 1980s children's TV show Faerie Tale Theatre. Her acting roles diminished in the 1990s, with Jane Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady the pick of the crop, and she dropped off the radar in 2002. The New York Times attributed her apparent disappearance to the impact of a 1994 earthquake that damaged her Los Angeles home, and the stress of her brother having cancer. Discussing her prolonged absence from the screen, she told the paper in May she had been the victim of a fickle film industry. ""I was a star. I had leading roles. People think it's just ageing, but it's not. It's violence,"" she said. Asked to explain, she said: ""How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime they turn on you? ""You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true."" Concerns about her health were raised when she appeared on the TV talk show Dr Phil in 2016 and told him: ""I'm very sick. I need help."" She also talked about receiving messages from a ""shapeshifting"" Robin Williams following his death, and talked about malevolent forces who were out to do her harm, the paper said. Speaking about that period, Gilroy told the New York Times she had become ""paranoid and just kind of delusional"". Asked by the paper why she had agreed to return to the screen in The Forest Hills, she replied: ""I wanted to act again. And then this guy kept calling, and so I wound up doing it."" Novelist Nicole Flattery wrote in the Financial Times in 2023 that her return showed her magic had remained intact. In an article dubbing her the ""ultimate film star"", Flattery summed up her talent, writing: ""She’s a master at playing characters who act happy when they’re sad, their daffiness masking depth.""

269,Whole pod of 77 whales die in 'biggest mass stranding in decades',"A pod of 77 pilot whales has died after washing ashore on a beach in Orkney in what could be the biggest mass stranding for decades. The British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) had established 12 of the animals at Tresness Beach on the island of Sanday were still alive when they came out of the water. However the decision was taken to euthanise them after refloating efforts failed. The pod included male whales up to seven metres (22ft) long as well as females, calves and juveniles. Experts say it is too early to know what has caused the stranding, but it is likely one of the whales got into trouble and the rest of the pod tried to help. Members of the public are being asked to stay away from the area post mortem examinations are carried out. It is thought to be the largest stranding event in Scotland since at least 1995, when the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) was founded - though strandings of a similar scale have been seen in recent years. Last year an entire pod of 55 pilot whales died following a stranding on Lewis. Only 15 of whales were alive when they were washed ashore. One was successfully re-floated while the rest had to be euthanised. Between 60-70 of the animals came into shallow waters in Sutherland in 2011. According to the Natural History Museum, the largest UK stranding took place in 1927 when 126 out of more than 130 false killer whales died in the Dornoch Firth in the Highlands. Experts from the BDMLR, the Scottish SPCA and marine vets from the Scottish mainland travelled to Sanday to assess whether any of the whales could be saved. The area was cut off by the high tide and the sand on the beach where they were stranded proved too soft to allow the mammals to be righted.  The whales needed to be moved back into an upright position as quickly as possible if there is to be any chance of saving them. But the soft sand meant the whales fell back over when the rescuers attempted to right them. Emma Neave-Webb from the BDMLR said early on that while these experiences are difficult, the thinking had to be ""realistic"". BDMLR medics were brought in from mainland Orkney and Inverness to help with the rescue attempt, but Ms Neave-Webb said it appeared they whales had been stranded for ""quite some time"". She described the scene as ""really quite horrible"" and ""hugely emotional"". Rescuers attempted to keep the whales alive by pouring sea water over them, but the decision was later taken to euthanise them. A spokesperson for Orkney Islands Council said discussions were taking place with community representatives on how best to dispose of the bodies. They said: ""In previous circumstances where whales have beached on our shores and subsequently died, the approach from our Environmental Health team around disposing of the body has been to allow nature to take its course - with the public advised to stay away from the area. ""Our assessment in this case, given the scale and the likely public health implications, is that more definite action will need to be taken, for example burying them where they are or removing the bodies to a large grave site elsewhere."" Andrew Brownlow of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme said mass strandings of this scale are becoming more common in Scotland. He told BBC News: ""It used to be quite unusual to have a mass stranding event, certainly of this  size.  ""But over the last ten years or so we have seen an increase both in the number of mass stranding events around Scotland and also the size of the mass and the number of animals that it involves.  ""So that is slightly concerning and that might be because there are just more animals out there, or it could be that there are more hazards that these animals are exposed to.”",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6xzrxy35o,"Megan Bonar & Rob Flett,",2024-07-11 17:11:15,
268,Biden introduces Zelensky as Putin before high-stakes news conference,"Gary O'DonoghueSenior North America correspondent Joe Biden is set to field questions from reporters about his fitness to run for president again, as more Democrats join calls for him to step aside.  The news conference at the end of the Nato summit in Washington tonight will be the president's most unscripted appearance since the debate with Donald Trump last month, in which he appeared to lose his train of thought several times.  In many ways, the White House has set the president an impossible task - a press conference on which everything now seems to ride. It's his first in eight months - and few would argue that Biden was a gaffe-free performer even at the height of his powers.  The problem he faces is that so much has already been said that it would require a performance of gargantuan proportion to turn around this seemingly inexorable narrative. But Biden is hoping he has managed to shore up support domestically and quieted dissent within his own party, after sending his advisers to meet Democratic senators ahead of the event. The loyalists - an ever-diminishing number - continue to argue the party is best placed to stick with Biden as their nominee.  That optimism feels like clutching at straws, however. Political leadership can evaporate in a moment, and Joe Biden is just having too many of those moments right now.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2v0nzx16gzt,Unknown,Unknown,
267,From living on the street to advising Prince William,"Sabrina Cohen-Hatton has gone from rough sleeping as a teenager to visiting the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle to give him advice on tackling homelessness. She was able to give her own story to Prince William as proof that homeless people should not be ""written off"". ""I sit in front of you now with a job, a home, a family and a PhD,"" said Sabrina, who works as a fire service chief. Prince William marked the first year of his Homewards project with a visit to Lambeth in south London where he pleged: ""It is possible to end homelessness."" The prince delivered the message that there is nothing inevitable about homelessness and that it shouldn't be normalised. Meeting Homewards representatives in Brixton he said: “Homelessness is a complex societal issue, and one that touches the lives of far too many people in our society. However, I truly believe that it can be ended."" He spoke of the importance of ""shifting perspectives"" about homeless people and the need to ""focus on prevention, rather than simply managing the crisis"". Homewards is a five-year project based around six areas around the UK. That includes Newport in South Wales - and as a 15- and 16-year-old that was where Sabrina was sleeping rough, after the death of a parent and problems at home. Her way out was selling the Big Issue - ""I credit them with saving my life"" - and once she had secure accommodation she was able to get a job in the fire service, which became her career. She used this ""lived experience""  to tell Prince William and the Homewards project about what was needed. ""There were lots of closed doors in my face,"" she said. Even when support was meant to be available, she said in practice it could be hard for homeless people to have the confidence to access it. Or there can be practical barriers. She said she relied on her dog, called Menace, but many hostels wouldn't let people stay with pets. Sabrina also warned of how homelessness was linked to the ""pernicious"" long-term impact of poverty. She went on to become chief fire officer of West Sussex and has spoken widely about her own journey, including this latest role as an advocate for Homewards. Sabrina said Prince William showed a lot of ""empathy"" towards the issue of homelessness, which she suggested reflected some of the ""trauma"" in his early life. At the event in Brixton, Sabrina spoke alongside Chris Lynam, who recalled the intense ""loneliness"" that accompanied his own homelessness and drug addiction. ""It's a very isolating experience... society is quite hostile to homeless people,"" said Chris, who is now supporting Homewards' work in Sheffield. Prince William described it as an ""honour"" to hear Chris talk about his experiences. The homelessness project, operating in Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Lambeth, Newport, Sheffield and Northern Ireland, wants to find successful approaches that can be replicated elsewhere. There are links with employers about helping people into work. A partnership with Homebase provides starter packs of furniture to help those moving from homelessness into accommodation. There are efforts to identify sofa-surfing and addressing links between relationship breakdown and homelessness. Putting housing officers in schools has been tried to identify young people who might be at risk. Through the Duchy of Cornwall there are 24 homes being built with ""wrap-around support"" for people leaving homelessness - and Prince William is now involved in developing further plans. There is a push to change attitudes towards homelessness - and Sabrina talked about the need to get rid of the stigma. She said that for 20 years she hadn't told anyone about her own experiences, before becoming such a public speaker about homelessness. Matt Downie, chief executive of Crisis, says the Homewards project can challenge the ""cynicism and fatalism"" that says homelessness is inevitable. He says that even though the big picture has seen homelessness getting worse, the evidence exists to prevent it. Finland is given as an example of a sustained drive to end homelessness, with the claim that there are now only about 150 homeless families. In contrast in the UK, there are more than 100,000 households categorised as homeless. There have also been questions about whether a wealthy royal should be pronouncing on homelessness. The anti-monarchy group Republic has previously described it as ""crass and hypocritical"". But George Anderson, a Big Issue seller and medical researcher in London, welcomes that Prince William has used his high public profile to talk about homelessness. ""He encourages people who are distant from homelessness to feel empathy and care,"" says George. ""Given the pomp and ceremony around his official role, it is easy for people to question as to what he really knows about homelessness,"" says George. ""I am sure that he is aware of that whilst also knowing he is in a position, like his mother, to highlight the plight of homelessness to the media. ""His mother would have experienced similar, being photographed in a tiara at a ball one day, whilst serving soup in a homeless kitchen the next,"" says George, who sees the prince's interest as being linked to Princess Diana bringing her sons to homelessness charities when they were children.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1weg5en21wo,"Sean Coughlan,",2024-07-11 13:11:15,
265,'Miracle baby' survives days alone on a roadside,"A days-long search for a missing baby boy in Louisiana has ended after a truck driver spotted the one-year-old crawling through the grass alongside a busy highway.  Sheriff Gary Guillory told the BBC that the child's discovery ""was a miracle"", after he survived alone outdoors for ""two days with no water and no food"".  Calcasieu police had been searching for the baby since 8 July, the day they found his four-year-old brother deceased in a nearby pond.  The same day, a press release sent out by police caused a local media storm that led to the arrest of Aaliyah Jack, the boys' mother, in Mississippi, hundreds of miles away. Ms Jack is in jail in Meridian, Mississippi, awaiting extradition to Louisiana on a charge of failing to report a missing child.  Mr Guillory said that additional charges may be added. The baby was taken to hospital and released on Wednesday to child protective services.  ""We call him a miracle baby,"" Sheriff Guillory said. ""He did have insect bites all over his body, but he was in good spirits. We're just thankful."" The sheriff said the weather worked in their favour.  ""The sun never really came out and heated up the air,"" he said, referring to Louisiana's often brutal summer temperatures.  ""We had some remnants from [Hurricane] Beryl, some extra cloud coverage that probably kept his body cool. We were very lucky.""  The sequence of events leading to the baby's rescue began on Monday when the Calcasieu Parish Sherrifs Office received a call about a body being located in a pond near the Vinton Welcome Center. ""Our first priority was to get it out to the news media and get some leads,"" Mr Guillory said.  ""And that's exactly what happened.""  On Monday evening, the sheriff's office received a call from a grandmother who had seen the reports and was concerned about her grandchildren. She told police the four-year-old had a younger brother, which caused police to issue a 'bolo' (be on the lookout) alert for the missing one-year-old and his mother. Ms Jackson was arrested at a train station in Mississippi hours later. On Tuesday morning, a marine division of the sheriff's office was boating through the pond where the brother had been found, searching for the missing boy.  They then received a call around 09:00 EST (14:00 BST) from a truck driver along Interstate-10 near the Texas-Louisiana border who said he had seen a baby ""crawling"" through a nearby ditch.  Mr Guillory said the investigation is ongoing and the cause of death for the four-year-old is currently unknown. An autopsy report is pending.

264,Canada to hit Nato spending target by 2032 - Trudeau,"Canada will reach the benchmark that requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military by 2032, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said. Speaking at the Nato summit in Washington DC, Mr Trudeau also hit back at those using a ""crude mathematical calculation"" to criticise an ally that ""continually punches above its weight"". As the military alliance marks its 75th anniversary, pressure has been mounting for members to meet the spending target set out by its doctrine. Canada currently spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military. The Nato founding member places seventh overall among 32 nations in the amount of money it spends on defence. But using the 2% metric, America's northern neighbour is ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the 32-member alliance.  By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%. Frustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators, who urged the country to immediately develop a plan to increase its spending.  Some US lawmakers have more bluntly criticised Canada over its Nato benchmark shortfall.  “They have the safety and security of being on our border and not having to worry about that. I think that’s shameful,"" Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson said this week.  ""I think if you’re going to be a member nation and participant, you need to do your part.”  Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters at the close of the annual summit on Thursday. ""Since 2015, we've added C$175bn in defence spending,"" he said. ""Canada fully expects to reach Nato's 2% of GDP spending target by 2032."" He added that the government has ""built in a regular cycle of review in Canada's defence, including a new defence policy update in 2028"". ""Through that process, we will continue to explore opportunities that will further increase defence spending and advance Canada's strategic interests,"" he said. The Nato alliance finds itself at a critical moment, as member nations grapple with a more aggressive Russia that continues to wage war in Ukraine.  European allies are also concerned about the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency and the dramatic foreign policy shifts that would come with it.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yr36e6l9o,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-11 18:11:15,
263,'Relief' as Canadian serial killer found guilty in death of 4 women,"Tearful cheers erupted in a packed Canadian courtroom on Thursday as a judge found a serial killer guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of four indigenous women.  But in the court gallery, Jeremy Contois' reaction was reserved. His younger sister, Rebecca, was one of the women killed in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba two years ago. “I feel a little sense of relief,” Mr Contois said, but will not get full closure until the killer, Jeremy Skibicki, is formally sentenced. In his oral verdict, Manitoba Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal dismissed the argument by the defence at trial that the accused was not criminally responsible for the murders.  Lawyers for Skibicki, 37, said he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the killings. Prosecutors argued that Skibicki deliberately killed Ms Contois and three other women in 2022 in crimes that were calculated and racially motivated. Warning: This story contains details readers may find distressing. The murders and the subsequent weeks-long trial sent shockwaves through Canada’s indigenous community, which has long grappled with cases of violence against their women. Wearing a grey T-shirt and pants, Skibicki did not react as Judge Joyal read aloud the summary of his judgment. One of Ms Contois’ family members held up a large photo of Rebecca in his direction as he left the courtroom.  “Why did I lift up her photo? Because we, as First Nations people, are not statistics,” Krista Fox said afterwards. “Every single one of us has a name, and a family that misses us dearly.” Skibicki's victims are Morgan Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26 and Ms Contois, who was 24. The fourth woman has yet to be identified, and has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman, by indigenous elders. Throughout the trial, a buffalo head sat on a red cloth on a table near the prosecutors in tribute to the still unidentified victim.  In his verdict, Judge Joyal said the accused failed to demonstrate he was not criminally responsible for the murders, dismissing the testimony of a British psychiatrist, Dr Sohom Das, who said Skibicki was motivated by delusions when he committed the murders. The judge added that the ""mercilessly graphic"" facts of the case ""are largely uncontested"", given that the accused had admitted to the murders in police interviews and in court prior to the trial.  Skibicki had pleaded not guilty due to a mental disorder. The 100-person courtroom was packed full with the four women's families and friends for the verdict. Judge Joyal said the case has had an ""undeniable and profound impact on the entire Manitoba community, indigenous and non-indigenous"". With Skibicki facing life behind bars, the focus is now shifting to finding the remains of two of his victims, Ms Myran and Ms Harris, which are believed to be in a Winnipeg landfill. A formal search has been set for this autumn, after months of pressure from their families.  According to court documents, Skibicki killed the women between March and May of 2022, with Ms Contois believed to be the final victim. He met at least two at local homeless shelters in Winnipeg, a city of 820,000 in the prairie province. Judge Joyal agreed with prosecutors that he deliberately targeted and exploited “vulnerable” women. Over the course of the trial, the court heard that Skibicki had assaulted the women, strangled or drowned them and then committed sex acts on them before dismembering their bodies and disposing of them in garbage bins. The killings went undetected for months, until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki’s apartment found partial human remains in May 2022 and called police. “She’s obviously been murdered,” the man said in the 911 call, which was played in court. Police were able to identify the remains as those of Ms Contois. More of her remains were discovered at a city-run landfill the following month. In police interviews shortly after his arrest, Skibicki surprised officers by admitting to killing Ms Contois as well as three others. At that point, police had no knowledge of the other deaths. Speaking outside court, Ms Fox said she believes that it was only because Ms Contois’ remains were found that the other families were able to get justice. Skibicki’s lawyers tried to argue that he was not aware of the severity of his actions due to delusions driven by schizophrenia. They argued he was hearing voices that told him to commit the crimes as part of a mission from god. Prosecutors argued that Skibicki was fully aware of his actions, saying they were “intentional, purposeful and racially motivated”. They demonstrated this through a mix of DNA forensic evidence, surveillance footage showing Skibicki with the women in their final days, as well as testimony from his ex-wife, who detailed a history of physical abuse. Had Skibicki been found not criminally responsible for the four murders, it would have been a relative rarity in Canadian law. According to data from Canada's statistics agency and reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, between 2000 and 2022, of 8,883,749 criminal cases prosecuted across the country, only 5,178 – or 0.06% – had such verdicts. The case unearthed deep wounds for Canada’s indigenous community, which has long grappled with a high number of cases of their women going missing or being murdered. According to an investigation by the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, Winnipeg - a city near numerous indigenous communities - had the highest number of missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada between 2018 and 2022. Across Canada, indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women, according to a 2019 inquiry. Some indigenous women in the city remain missing, sparking fears from family members that Skibicki had more victims. The Crown, however, said they do not believe he murdered more women. Even with the relief of a guilty verdict, Mr Contois, Rebecca’s brother, said he still wonders why his sister - who is also a mother to a young daughter - was so brutally murdered. “Why did he have to do it?” he said. “I wish I knew that.”",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727v3d5v4lo,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-11 21:11:15,
262,Texas hospitals filling up as heat and power cuts take toll,"Hospitals in the Houston area are filling up after Hurricane Beryl left more than a million people in the city without electricity during a deadly heat wave. The city's football stadium has been converted into a ""transitional facility"" for when hospitals reach capacity, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said. ""[Hospitals] can't discharge patients because patients can't go home if they don't have power,"" Mr Patrick said at a press conference.  Tens of millions of people were under a heat advisory on Thursday, as searing temperatures scorch the US from California to Texas.  In Texas, a heat advisory has been issued in dozens of cities.  The threat is amplified in the Houston area, where temperatures are expected to reach 105F (40C), and where residents are still recovering from the hurricane. More than two million were without power as powerful winds uprooted trees and stripped powerlines on Monday.  Around 1.3 million people in the state still lack electricity. More than 100 cooling centres in the Houston area have been launched to help residents. There are also reports of long rows of cars idling in lines at filling stations waiting to refuel - becoming the last resort for those without indoor air conditioning. On Wednesday, Mr Patrick called it ""a miserable situation"".  ""It's pitch black at night"" and ""hot as Hades in the day"", he said, adding that people have also lost access to food that would normally be kept cool in a fridge.  Other parts of the US are also grappling with an ongoing heat wave that is expected to last through the weekend, including in typically milder climates like Oregon. Heat advisories have been issued for nine states, including Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Oregon.  In California, officials warned of ""dangerously hot conditions"" forecasting temperatures up to 120F (49C) in places like Palm Springs, lasting until Saturday.  A man in Sacramento died in hospital on Sunday after being brought from his non-air conditioned home, on a day when it was 106F (41C).  Further north, where temperatures are often cooler, similar triple-digit weather is expected in parts of Oregon, officials have warned.  Ten people have died in the state in connection to record-breaking heat, although further investigations are pending to determine exact causes of death.  More then 280 temperature records have been broken in the state this year, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Climate scientists say that average daily temperatures globally have increased, making hotter days more likely and more intense. The cause is often linked to human-led climate change.  Last year the planet reached its hottest recorded day four days in a row, according to data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c29d01j1jkzo,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-11 18:11:15,
266,Hungary's Viktor Orbán to meet Donald Trump,"Donald Trump will meet Viktor Orbán in Florida on Thursday night, just weeks after the Hungarian prime minister met Russia's Vladimir Putin.  His visit to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach is the latest in a number of meetings between the two men.  Mr Orbán has publicly endorsed Trump's re-election bid and recently said there was a ""very, very high chance"" that President Joe Biden would lose the election.   The Hungarian leader has been frequently criticised in Europe for his pro-Russian views but remains popular among Trump supporters and US conservatives. He has also recently met China's Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a self-described ""peace"" initiative. On Wednesday, Russian newspaper Izvestia wrote such initiatives were futile, ""but Viktor Orbán may pass information he has collected to Trump's team"".  Mr Orbán told German media earlier this week that the former US president was a ""self-made man"" with a ""different approach to everything"".  A Trump victory in the US election would be ""good for the world politics"", he added.  ""He [Trump] is a man of peace. Under his four-year term he did not initiate a single war, and he did a lot in order to create peace in old conflicts in very complicated areas of the world.""  Mr Orbán, whose country currently holds the presidency of the European Union, also criticised the Biden administration for failing to end the conflict in Ukraine.  “I think new leadership will provide new chances,"" he said. Mr Orbán was the first and only EU leader to back Trump's bid for presidency in 2016, but had to wait until May 2019 for his first visit to the White House. Trump has found more time for the Hungarian leader out of power. At the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, he told cheering delegates: ""The globalists can all go to hell... I have come to Texas."" His creation of a similar group in his country, CPAC Hungary, has boosted his relationships further. In March this year, after meeting Trump in Florida, Mr Orbán posted on X/Twitter: ""We need leaders in the world who are respected and can bring peace. He is one of them! Come back and bring us peace, Mr President."" In April this year, Trump sent a short video message to CPAC Hungary, saying he was ""honoured to address so many patriots in Hungary... proudly fighting on the front lines of the battle to rescue western civilisation.  ""Together we’re engaged in an epic struggle to liberate our nations from all of the sinister forces who want to destroy them.’ He referred to Mr Orbán in the same address as ""a great man"". Mr Orbán has boasted that he has created an ""illiberal democracy"" in Hungary, and claims ""progressives"" have unleashed a ""virus"" of ""migration, gender, and the woke movement"".",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydvj24m4g4o,"Bernd Debusmann Jr & Nick Thorpe,",2024-07-11 20:11:15,
276,New technology reveals a sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet',"Researchers studying sperm whale communication say they've uncovered sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language. In the inky depths of the midnight zone, an ocean giant bears the scars of the giant squid she stalks. She searches the darkness, her echolocation pulsing through the water column. Then she buzzes – a burst of rapid clicks – just before she goes in for the kill. But exactly how sperm whales catch squid, like many other areas of their lives, remains a mystery. ""They're slow swimmers,"" says Kirsten Young, a marine scientist at the University of Exeter. Squid, on the other hand, are fast. ""How can [sperm whales] catch squid if they can only move at 3 knots [5.5 km/h or 3.5mph]? Are the squid moving really slowly? Or are the whales stunning them with their vocalisations? What happens down there? Nobody really knows,"" she says.    Sperm whales are not easy to study. They spend much of their lives foraging or hunting at depths beyond the reach of sunlight. They are capable of diving over 3km (10,000ft) and can hold their breath for two hours. ""At 1000m (3300ft) deep, many of the group will be facing the same way, flanking each other – but across an area of several kilometres,"" says Young. ""During this time they're talking, clicking the whole time."" After about an hour, she says, the group rises to the surface in synchrony. ""They'll then have their rest phase. They might be at the surface for 15 to 20 minutes. Then they'll dive again,"" she says.    At the end of a day of foraging, says Young, the sperm whales come together at the surface and rub against each other, chatting while they socialise. ""As researchers, we don't see a lot of their behaviour because they don't spend that much time at the surface,"" she says. ""There's masses we don't know about them, because we are just seeing a tiny little snapshot of their lives during that 15 minutes at the surface.""    It was around 47 million years ago that land-roaming cetaceans began to gravitate back towards the ocean – that's 47 million years of evolution in an environment alien to our own. How can we hope to easily understand creatures that have adapted to live and communicate under such different evolutionary pressures to ourselves?      ""It's easier to translate the parts where our world and their world overlap – like eating, nursing or sleeping,"" says David Gruber, lead and founder of the Cetacean Translation Initiative (Ceti) and professor of biology at the City University of New York. ""As mammals, we share these basics with others. But I think it's going to get really interesting when we try to understand the areas of their world where there's no intersection with our own,"" he says. Now, from elephants to dogs, modern technology is helping researchers to sift through enormous datasets, and uncover previously unknown diversity and complexity in animal communication. And Ceti's researchers say they, too, have used AI to decode a ""sperm whale phonetic alphabet"". In 2005, Shane Gero, biology lead for Ceti, founded The Dominica Sperm Whale Project to study the social and vocal behaviour of around 400 sperm whales that live in the Eastern Caribbean. Almost 20 years – and thousands of hours of observation – later, the researchers have discovered intricacies in whale vocalisations never before observed, revealing structures within sperm whale communication akin to human language. Sperm whales live in multi-level, matrilineal societies – groups of daughters, mothers and grandmothers – while the males roam the oceans, visiting the groups to breed. They are known for their complex social behaviour and group decision-making, which requires sophisticated communication. For example, they are able to adapt their behaviour as a group when protecting themselves from predators like orcas or humans.    Sperm whales communicate with each other using rhythmic sequences of clicks, called codas. It was previously thought that sperm whales had just 21 coda types. However, after studying almost 9,000 recordings, the Ceti researchers identified 156 distinct codas. They also noticed the basic building blocks of these codas which they describe as a ""sperm whale phonetic alphabet"" – much like phonemes, the units of sound in human language which combine to form words. (Watch the video below to hear some of the variety in sperm whale vocalisations the AI identified.) Pratyusha Sharma, a PhD student at MIT and lead author of the study, describes the ""fine-grain changes"" in vocalisations the AI identified. Each coda consists of between three and 40 rapid-fire clicks. The sperm whales were found to vary the overall speed, or the ""tempo"", of the codas, as well as to speed up and slow down during the delivery of a coda, in other words, making it ""rubato"". Sometimes they added an extra click at the end of a coda, akin, says Sharma, to ""ornamentation"" in music. These subtle variations, she says, suggest sperm whale vocalisations could carry a much richer amount of information than previously thought.    ""Some of these features are contextual,"" says Sharma. ""In human language, for example, I can say 'what' or 'whaaaat!?'. It's the same word, but to understand the meaning you have to listen to the whole sound,"" she says.    The researchers also found the sperm whale ""phonemes"" could be used in a combinatorial fashion, allowing the whales to construct a vast repertoire of distinct vocalisations. The existence of a combinatorial coding system, write the report authors, is a prerequisite for ""duality of patterning"" – a linguistic phenomenon thought to be unique to human language – in which meaningless elements combine to form meaningful words. However, Sharma emphasises, this is not something they have any evidence of as yet. ""What we show in sperm whales is that the codas themselves are formed by combining from this basic set of features. Then the codas get sequenced together to form coda sequences."" Much like humans combine phonemes to create words, and then words to create sentences.    So, what does all this tell us about sperm whales' intelligence? Or their ability to reason, or store and share information?    ""Well, it doesn't tell us anything yet,"" says Gruber. ""Before we can get to those amazing questions, we need to build a fundamental understanding of how [sperm whales communicate] and what's meaningful to them. We see them living very complicated lives, the coordination and sophistication in their behaviours.  We're at base camp. This is a new place for humans to be – just give us a few years. Artificial intelligence is allowing us to see deeper into whale communication than we've ever seen before.""    But not everyone is convinced, with experts warning of an anthropocentric focus on language which risks forcing us to view things from one perspective. More like this:  • The scientists learning to speak whale • Scientists built this listening network to detect nuclear bomb tests. It found blue whales instead • The unknown giants of the deep oceans Young, though, describes the research as an ""incremental step"" towards understanding these giants of the deep. ""We're starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together,"" she says. And perhaps if we could listen and really understand something like how important sperm whales' grandmothers are to them – something that resonates with humans, she says, we could drive change in human behaviour in order to protect them.    Categorised as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), sperm whales are still recovering from commercial hunting by humans in the 19th and 20th Centuries. And, although such whaling has been banned for decades, sperm whales face new threats such as climate change, ocean noise pollution and ship strikes.    However, Young adds, we're still a long way off from understanding what sperm whales might be saying to each other.  ""We really have no idea. But the better we can understand these amazing animals, the more we'll know about how we can protect them."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

274,Why both businesses and scammers love India's payment system,"Every day, for the last seven years, Arun Kumar has set up his fruit stall on a busy Mumbai street. It's not an easy way to make a living. “Being a street vendor is a challenge. There's the fear of being robbed or, as I am not a licensed vendor, the local body can come and dismantle my store anytime,"" he says. But over the past four years at least one aspect of his work has become easier.  “Prior to Covid everything was in cash. But now everyone pays with UPI. Scan the code and the payment is done within seconds. ""No issues of handling cash, giving change to customers. It has made my life and business smooth,” he says. UPI, or to give it its full name the Unified Payments Interface, was launched in 2016  in a collaboration between India's central bank and the nation's banking industry. It's an app-based instant payment system, which allows users to send and receive money, pay bills and authorise payments in a single step - no need to enter bank details or any other personal information. And, perhaps most importantly, it's free. It has become so popular that India is now the biggest real-time payments market. In May, UPI recorded 14 billion transactions, up from nine billion the year before.  But the popularity and ease of use has made it a rich feeding ground for scammers. “While digital payments are convenient, they do come with vulnerabilities,"" says Shashank Shekhar, founder of the Delhi-based Future Crime Research Foundation. Mr Shekhar says that scammers use a variety of ways to trick people, including persuading them to share their UPI pin number, which is needed to authorise payments. Some scammers have also created fake UPI apps, that are clones of legitimate banking apps, and then steal login details or other valuable information. ""The pace at which digital transformation took place in the country means unfortunately digital literacy and safe internet practice could not catch up,"" says Mr Shekhar. He says that between January 2020 and June 2023 almost half of all financial fraud involved the use of the UPI system. According to government figures there were more than 95,000 cases of fraud involving UPI in the financial year ending April 2023, up from 77,000 in the previous year. Shivkali was one such victim. She had always wanted to own a scooter, but they were beyond her budget. However, earlier in the year the 22-year-old, who lives in Bihar state in northeastern India, spotted one for sale on Facebook that looked like a great deal. ""I grabbed the opportunity without thinking,"" she says.  A couple of clicks later and she was talking to the owner, who said that for $23 he would send over the vehicle papers. That went smoothly, so Shivkali continued to send the owner money, via instant transfers. She eventually ended up paying $200, but the scooter (also commonly called a Scooty in India), was never delivered. Shivkali realised she had been scammed. ""I did not think I could be cheated, as I have some education background and know what is happing in the world. But scammers are smart. They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,” she says. The government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers. But at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank. “The problem is deep rooted,"" says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime. ""Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that’s why the fraudster can’t be traced. ""But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.” But Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame. “It’s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it’s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case. I would say both victim and bank should bear the loss.” Despite those problems, UPI is being promoted in rural areas where access to banking services can be difficult. Poonam Untwal from Rajasthan runs a guidance centre which helps people use the internet and digital banking. ""Most of us are not that educated, nor know the proper use of smartphones. I teach them that phones are no longer a device just to talk to people but banks at their fingertips,"" she says. She believes that UPI will help develop the local economy. ""Many women like me have a small business that we run from our home. Now we can receive and send money with UPI. People who don’t have smart phones come to my centre to get their transactions done,"" she says. As well as making inroads into rural areas, UPI is spreading overseas. Retailers in Bhutan, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and UAE will take UPI payments.  And this year, France become the first European country to accept UPI payments, starting with tickets to the Eiffel Tower. Back in Mumbai, Mr Kumar is happy that he no longer has to use cash, but remains wary. If he can't get a good internet connection then customers can, by accident or design, make off without paying.  ""For a small vendor like me it [UPI] made receiving money very easy. But I am always scared of fraud. I keep hearing in the news how the UPI frauds are increasing. Hopefully some mechanisms are invented so a small vendor like me doesn’t face losses.”",2024-07-11 23:11:16,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c288m1km01po,"Priti Gupta,",2024-07-11 21:11:16,
275,Can Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily,"Knives are out for Joe Biden after his poorly received performance in the first 2024 presidential debate against Donald Trump.  With November's election bearing down, a growing number of Democrats are calling on the president to step aside due to concerns about his mental fitness.  Around a dozen Democrats have publicly broken ranks and called for Mr Biden to step aside to be replaced by someone younger from his party. Mr Biden has defiantly vowed to stay in the race, including during public events and in interviews with ABC News and MSNBC.   Unless he agrees to stand aside, it will get ugly.  Let's run through the scenarios. Yes, if - and it's a big if - Mr Biden decides to step down as the Democratic Party's standard bearer, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are reportedly planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually ahead of that gathering. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of ""delegates"" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election.  This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are ""pledged"" to support the incumbent president.  If Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all.  Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes.  That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination.  Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside.  But if he decides to do so, ""that opens up an entirely different can of worms"", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News.   ""I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,"" she said.   If he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination.  However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out.  The rules allow delegates to ""in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them"", meaning they could look to someone else. ""It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,"" Ms Wright Rigueur said.  Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for re-election. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results.  Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention.  Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. It may be that Mr Biden backs her to replace him if he steps aside. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris would have access to all the campaign funds currently available to the president. And she has a national profile. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage.   The 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows the US vice-president and the majority of the cabinet to declare the president unable to perform the duties of office.  If invoked, power is transferred to the vice-president to serve as acting president.   This has never happened before.  But following the debate, senior congressional Republicans called on Mr Biden's cabinet to consider invoking this clause.  After the US Capitol riot in 2021, the Democratic-controlled House approved a resolution urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump, but the move went nowhere.",2024-07-11 23:11:16,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv821nljwo,"Christal Hayes, Holly Honderich & Rachel Looker,",2024-07-11 22:11:16,
277,Should I stay or should I go? The dilemma for young Nigerians,"Nigerian graduate Olotu Olanrewaju is facing a choice between remaining in the country he loves and the possibility of a better life elsewhere. He adores the culture, food, music and family mentality at home, especially how people look out for each other and share common goals. But the 24-year-old electrical engineer feels he is being held back professionally. “I’m looking for greener pastures and better opportunities, rather than getting stuck here in Nigeria,” he tells the BBC’s What in the World podcast, adding that he thinks his degree would be “more appreciated” abroad. There is also the feeling that the lack of reliable basic infrastructure - causing things like power cuts - as well as security concerns, corruption and poor governance, all create unnecessary barriers to getting on with life. Mr Olanrewaju is one of tens of thousands of young, disenchanted Nigerians contemplating the move to join many others overseas. It’s a trend known by the Yoruba word “japa” meaning “to escape”. The BBC contacted several government officials for a response to what he and other young Nigerians told us but has not received a reply. The idea of emigrating from Nigeria is not new. Since the 1980s, many middle-class Nigerians have sought economic opportunities abroad, but the scale and urgency now feels different and japa is becoming increasingly popular with Gen Z and millennials. An African Polling Institute survey from 2022 found that 69% of Nigerians aged 18-35 would relocate given the opportunity - despite a slight fall from 2021. In 2019 the figure was just 39%. On social media, young Nigerians have taken to posting about their japa experiences. While some describe how they miss home, others show off the appeal of relocating, and encourage their peers to do the same. But leaving is a pricey venture. The rising cost of living, and the depreciation of the currency, the naira, has made an expensive process even harder - but also pushed more people to try to leave.   It is far easier for professionals and university graduates who have the skills and qualifications needed to secure well-paying jobs and visas in the West, as well as the finances to start a new life in a country where the cost of living is far higher than at home. As well as those seeking legal routes, many Nigerians try to move abroad without visas, by crossing the Sahara Desert or the Mediterranean Sea. Thousands of people die each year on the journey and those who make it often struggle to find work or somewhere decent to live. For years, Mr Olanrewaju and his parents have been saving up. He hopes to move to Germany or Spain and has signed up to German classes to improve his chances. He is not the first in his family to tread this path. Two years ago, his brother Daniel, now 27, managed to swap Nigeria’s sticky heat for the cooler shores of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. He works there as a photographer and social worker, and although he finds it a bit expensive, he tells his brother about the benefits of Scotland’s infrastructure – including the fact that people can rely on the electricity, water and transport systems working. Social worker Oluwatobi Abodunrin, 29, moved to London last year and also feels positive about her move. She says Nigeria is filled with “passionate, active youths” who want something more from their careers. “I decided to leave Nigeria because I wasn't getting what I want,” she says. “We are highly talented, we want to be recognised, we want our voice to be heard and we want to be respected.” She also acknowledges the difficulty of leaving friends and family behind. “It was a tough decision to leave home. To leave people who are sweet, kind, generous and passionate. But I'm happy I made the decision and it's going well.” There are more than 270,000 Nigerians like Ms Abodunrin living in the UK, according to government statistics. It is one of the most popular destinations for japa, with the number of Nigerians granted UK work visas quadrupling since 2019 as a result of post-Brexit immigration rule changes.  However, the UK has responded to this increase by tightening the rules for those seeking work visas. The US and Canada are also highly desirable. Canada has seen a surge in migration, with the number of Nigerians seeking residency there tripling since 2015, a phenomenon known as the “Canada Rush”. Back in Nigeria, zoology student Elizabeth Ademuyi Anuoluwapo recognises the difficulties in leaving, but feels it is the only way to get the financial stability she needs. “I’d miss my people, my food, my friends, my family. The vibe here is very cosy,” she says. “Maybe I’d go for a few years and then come back.” Japa has hit the medical profession especially hard. The Nigerian Medical Association said, in 2022, at least 50 doctors were leaving the country every single week. This has left an already overloaded healthcare system struggling. The government has said it will train more people to fill these gaps and backed a new bill that would require medical graduates to work in Nigeria for a minimum of five years after completing their training. It was fiercely opposed by doctors’ unions. A similar directive has also been issued for nurses, to get them to work in the country for at least two years before trying to leave. Some like Dr Vongdip Nankpah, from the University of Abuja teaching hospital, think it is important to stay. He believes that career goals are about more than an individual’s interest - they should involve the community and the value that a person can contribute to society. “If I’m going to maximise my medical practice, I’d rather remain in Nigeria to see if we can better the country and the region,” he says. “These are the things that are still driving my reasons for remaining in the country.” But despite the emotional attachment, Mr Olanrewaju does not feel he owes anything to Nigeria and would not feel guilty for leaving. “Most of my personal growth and gains, I worked for them myself,” he says. Instead, he would see himself as a representative of Nigerians abroad, standing for those who might not have the same opportunities to move overseas. For those who can afford it, japa is the ultimate choice. It promises a future of adventure, ambition and wealth, but also risks breaking ties with the past. Like many Nigerian students, Mr Olanrewaju is now measuring those benefits against the cost of what he is leaving behind.

279,Carla Bruni-Sarkozy charged with witness tampering,"France's former first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has been charged over an election funding scandal dating back to 2007 involving cash from the then Libyan dictator, Col Muammar Gaddafi. According to French media, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, 56, was charged with hiding evidence and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud. She was placed under judicial control and barred from being in contact with all those accused except her husband, Nicolas Sarkozy.  Ms Bruni-Sarkozy is also suspected of concealment of witness tampering and involvement in an attempt to bribe Lebanese judicial personnel, among other violations. Her lawyers told AFP that Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was determined to assert her rights and challenge the ""unfounded decision"". Mr Sarkozy, who was the president of France from 2007 to 2012, is due to go on trial next year over allegations he took money from Gaddafi to finance his successful election bid. He is accused of corruption, illegal campaign financing, benefiting from embezzled public funds and membership in a criminal conspiracy. He has always denied all the charges. The investigation into the allegations was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then leader Gaddafi, first accused Mr Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding. The following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East, supported the claims. He told judges he had written proof that Mr Sarkozy's campaign bid was ""abundantly"" financed by Tripoli, and that the €50m (£43m) worth of payments continued after he became president. Years later, Mr Takieddine told French media that in 2006-07 he had personally handed over suitcases stuffed with banknotes to Mr Sarkozy and his chief of staff, Claude Guéant, who later denied this. But in 2020, Mr Takieddine suddenly retracted his statement about handing over large amounts of money. This raised suspicions that Mr Sarkozy and his allies - including his wife - might have paid him to change his mind. In June, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was found to have deleted messages exchanged with a French businesswoman who was questioned by police over accusations of witness tampering. Since losing his re-election bid to socialist François Hollande in 2012, Mr Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations. In 2023, he was given a suspended prison sentence for trying to bribe a judge, and earlier this year, he was found guilty of illegally funding his 2012 re-election campaign. He and Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, an Italian-born former supermodel and singer, married in 2008. They had a daughter, Giulia, in 2011.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno,"Laura Gozzi,",2024-07-10 23:11:17,
284,Anger in Egypt after crash cyclist picked for Olympics,"With just two weeks to go until the Paris 2024 Olympics begin, many Egyptians are debating the decision to select as a competitor a cyclist who collided with a rival team-mate who was knocked into a cement barrier. In April, cyclist Ganna Eliwa, 19, was left concussed and with a broken right collarbone and severe cuts and bruises to the right-hand side of her body, according to a medical report, after she was pushed off her bike 300m (980ft) before the finishing line. In video of the incident, her opponent, Shahd Saeed, also 19, is seen riding behind Eliwa before she swerves, forcing Eliwa into the barrier. The latter underwent an operation to fix her right shoulder, suffered temporary loss of memory and is still unable to resume her business. Saeed said a couple of times that it was an accident, but Eliwa says her opponent never apologised for what happened. It is unclear what caused Saeed to swerve into the other rider. After an investigation into the incident, the Egyptian Cycling Federation suspended Saeed from the sport for one year and fined her the equivalent of $100 (£77) - the maximum penalty. Despite this, they still registered her name among the competitors in the Paris Olympics track cycling, causing public anger in Egypt. On Facebook, users swarmed the account of the federation, appealing to it to strike Saeed’s name off the list of competitors. One comment read: “Best of luck to all participants except for the rider who pushed her colleague. She’s not the best person to represent Egypt.” Eliwa also featured prominently on night-time talk shows, wishing Saeed bad luck. “I hope she can take part in the Paris Olympics because I’m pretty sure she would come last,” she told one TV presenter. The president of the Egyptian Cycling Federation said Saeed’s participation in the Olympics was “in favour of Egypt”, noting that the organisation could not remove her because it was too late to replace her. Many commentators compared Saeed to Mohammed Ali Rashwan, an Egyptian judoka who prized fair play above a gold medal at the Los Angles Olympics in 1984. ""By refusing to attack his opponent’s clearly injured right leg, the Egyptian judoka lost an obvious opportunity to be crowned Olympic champion, but instead he won worldwide acclaim and inner peace,” some quoted the International Olympic Committee as saying about Rashwan. Others said the choice of Saeed violated the three values of Olympism - excellence, respect and friendship - and urged authorities to reconsider their decision. Prompted by the criticism, the ministry of sports asked the Egyptian Olympic Committee to examine Saeed’s participation in Paris 2024 in light of “international accords and ethical rules”. After maintaining a long silence under fire, Saeed told a local newspaper this incident was in the past, questioning why it was raised again before the games. She again reiterated the incident was not “deliberate”. Cycling is not a popular sport in Egypt, but President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi frequently encourages men and women to get on their bikes.  He has been pictured numerous times leading hundreds of cyclists, including public figures, on a rally through Cairo at dawn.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwynzgxvzzo,"Wael Hussein,",2024-07-11 19:11:17,
285,From semi-pro soccer to Euro final - Watkins' 'unbelievable' rise,"This video can not be played Watkins score late winner for England ""I've been waiting for that moment for weeks,"" said Ollie Watkins afterwards - and boy did he take it. With the clock about to hit 90:00 in England's Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands, with the score at 1-1 in Dortmund, the ball fell to the striker from Devon, who was still playing in the English Football League just over four years ago at the age of 24. The Aston Villa man turned Stefan de Vrij and hammered a shot into the bottom corner for one of the most important England goals ever scored. Rewind nine years and he had just finished a loan spell at non-league Weston-super-Mare from League Two Exeter City. Asked after his Dortmund heroics whether he could have imagined this at the time, he said: ""You can dream but I am a realist. I was just focused on getting back into the first team at Exeter. ""I didn't dream about that to be honest. I can't lie and say I did. Scoring for England is amazing but I didn't think I'd do it in a tournament like that."" Watkins' winning goal more than justified Gareth Southgate's decision to choose him to replace England's all-time top scorer Harry Kane, with nine minutes to go. He came on alongside Cole Palmer, who set up his goal. ""I was wondering when the changes were going to happen. The changes were right and they were perfect,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Radio 5 Live. Former Brentford striker Watkins had only played 20 minutes at a major tournament before this, in the group stage against Denmark, having been left out of the Euro 2020 and 2022 World Cup squads. ""When I was on the bench I said to [sub keeper] Dean Henderson, 'I can make a difference today and need to get on'. I took my chance, scored it and now we are in the final. One last game,"" he said. That game is against Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final - as England bid to be European champions for the first time in men's football. This video can not be played 'The best feeling ever!' - Watkins on scoring England winner Unlike many England players, Watkins started his career lower in the football pyramid - at Exeter City. ""He had the perfect attitude, the perfect character and physical ability. He had all the boxes ticked yet, at 17, 18, 19 years old he never played as well as he should have done,"" said Paul Tisdale, Watkins' first manager at Exeter. At the age of 18, mostly playing on the wing, Watkins had made four first-team appearances for City before being sent on loan to Weston-super-Mare in the Conference South, the sixth tier. He scored 10 goals in 18 starts there - and broke into the Exeter team, as a striker. ""Suddenly the engine turned on. I've never seen a player have a quantum shift in their output as much as Ollie did,"" said Tisdale. He left for Championship Brentford in 2017 for £1.8m having scored 26 goals in 78 appearances for Exeter. Another 49 goals followed in 143 games for the Bees before he became the most expensive Championship player ever when he joined Aston Villa for £28m three years later. In this squad, only Ivan Toney - his rival for the spot to replace Kane late in games - has played more EFL games.  League games only (including play-offs) Watkins has kicked on at Villa with 70 goals in 169 games, hitting 19 Premier League goals last season to take his club into the Champions League. Dean Smith, who managed him at Brentford and Villa, said: ""I look at him now - he has become more of a selfish player, which is a good thing. ""His biggest strength could be his biggest weakness. He could beat himself up over things but it would also drive him. ""His emotional control now allows him to accept 'I will miss chances but I’ll be ready for the next one'."" Just last month Watkins said: ""Even when I first went to Villa, I'd just been bought for £30m and I was still unsure whether I deserved to be there.  ""I hadn't done it in the Premier League, so I would say there was a bit of that before. But now I'm in a really good place. ""I had a really good year, got the most assists in the league, scored a lot of goals and people still weren't including me in their squads to come to the Euros. ""Everyone has their own opinion, but I don't feel like I have that big profile where I'm talked about. Or where if I was left out of the squad, people would be like: 'Oh, I can't believe they didn't pick Ollie Watkins.' ""I'm happy I'm here now."" And so is Gareth Southgate. ""Ollie has trained every day and been ready to play, as the whole group has been,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new players in the group. Half have not been to a tournament but they have bonded so well, got each other's back and tonight was a good example of that."" Watkins' goal - timed at 89:59 - was the latest winning goal scored in a European Championship or World Cup semi-final, excluding extra time. It came with one of only 10 touches Watkins has had in the tournament. ""We talk about being ready,"" said Kane. ""We're a big team at being ready.  ""When it matters, you might get five minutes, one minute, but you can make a difference, you can win us a tournament. He's been waiting, he's been patient.  ""What he did was outstanding and he deserves it."" Ex-England striker Ian Wright was impressed watching the game for ITV. ""This is what Ollie Watkins does. This is the exact attitude I would want to have,"" he said.  ""You want Cole Palmer to come on and hit a pass that is perfect. In the moment, get back to the basics. It was absolutely perfect. Nobody did that to those defenders all night. They had an easy ride until he came on. ""Unbelievable moment. That's what you have come on to do - just take a shot. What's the worst that can happen? Ollie Watkins has done brilliantly. ""He's waited for his opportunity and he's done it. Now we're into the final. It's just amazing.""",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c134enzzg26o,Emlyn Begley,2024-07-11 23:11:17,
283,Will K-pop's AI experiment pay off?,"There’s an issue dividing K-pop fans right now - artificial intelligence. Several of the genre’s biggest stars have now used the technology to create music videos and write lyrics, including boy band Seventeen. Last year the South Korean group sold around 16 million albums, making them one of the most successful K-pop acts in history. But it’s their most recent album and single, Maestro, that’s got people talking. The music video features an AI-generated scene, and the record might well include AI-generated lyrics too. At the launch of the album in Seoul, one of the band members, Woozi, told reporters he was ""experimenting"" with AI when songwriting. “We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it,"" he said. ""This is a technological development that we have to leverage, not just be dissatisfied with. I practised using AI and tried to look for the pros and cons.” On K-pop discussion pages, fans were torn, with some saying more regulations need to be in place before the technology becomes normalised. Others were more open to it, including super fan Ashley Peralta. ""If AI can help an artist overcome creative blocks, then that’s OK with me,"" says the 26-year-old. Her worry though, is that a whole album of AI generated lyrics means fans will lose touch with their favourite musicians. ""I love it when music is a reflection of an artist and their emotions,"" she says. ""K-pop artists are much more respected when they’re hands on with choreographing, lyric writing and composing, because you get a piece of their thoughts and feelings. ""AI can take away that crucial component that connects fans to the artists."" Ashley presents Spill the Soju, a K-pop fan podcast, with her best friend Chelsea Toledo. Chelsea admires Seventeen for being a self-producing group, which means they write their own songs and choreograph them too, but she’s worried about AI having an impact on that reputation. “If they were to put out an album that’s full of lyrics they hadn’t personally written, I don’t know if it would feel like Seventeen any more and fans want music that is authentically them”. For those working in K-Pop production, it’s no surprise that artists are embracing new technologies. Chris Nairn is a producer, composer and songwriter working under the name Azodi. Over the past 12 years he’s written songs for K-pop artists including Kim Woojin and leading agency SM Entertainment. Working with K-pop stars means Chris, who lives in Brighton, has spent a lot of time in South Korea, whose music industry he describes as progressive. “What I've learned by hanging out in Seoul is that Koreans are big on innovation, and they're very big on ‘what's the next thing?’, and asking, ‘how can we be one step ahead?’ It really hit me when I was there,” he says. “So, to me, it's no surprise that they're implementing AI in lyric writing, it's about keeping up with technology.” Is AI the future of K-pop? Chris isn’t so sure. As someone who experiments with AI lyric generators, he doesn’t feel the lyrics are strong enough for top artists. “AI is putting out fairly good quality stuff, but when you're at the top tier of the songwriting game, generally, people who do best have innovated and created something brand new. AI works by taking what’s already been uploaded and therefore can’t innovate by itself.” If anything, Chris predicts AI in K-pop will increase the demand for more personal songs. ""There's going to be pressure from fans to hear lyrics that are from the artist's heart, and therefore sound different to any songs made using AI”. Seventeen aren’t the only K-pop  band experimenting with AI. Girl group Aespa, who have several AI members as well as human ones, also used the technology in their latest music video. Supernova features generated scenes where the faces of band members remain still as only their mouths move. Podcaster and super-fan Chelsea says it ""triggered"" a lot of people. “K-pop is known for amazing production and editing, so having whole scenes made of AI takes away the charm,"" she adds. Chelsea also worries about artists not getting the right credit. “With AI in videos it’s harder to know if someone’s original artwork has been stolen, it’s a really touchy subject”. Arpita Adhya is a music journalist and self-titled K-pop superfan. She believes the use of AI in the industry is demonstrative of the pressure artists are under to create new content. “Most recording artists will put out an album every two years, but K-pop groups are pushing out albums every six to eight months, because there’s so much hype around them.” She also believes AI has been normalised in the industry, with the introduction of AI covers which have exploded on YouTube. The cover tracks are created by fans and use technology to mimic another artist's voice. It's this kind of trend that Arpita would like to see regulated, something western artists are calling for too. Just last month megastars including Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj wrote an open letter calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped. They called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"". For Arpita, a lack of regulations means fans feel an obligation to regulate what is and isn’t OK. “Whilst there are no clear guidelines on how much artists can and can’t use AI, we have the struggle of making boundaries ourselves, and always asking ‘what is right and wrong?’” Thankfully she feels K-pop artists are aware of public opinion and hopes there will be change. “The fans are the biggest part and they have a lot of influence over artists. Groups are always keen to learn and listen, and if Seventeen and Aespa realise they are hurting their fans, they will hopefully address that.”",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngr3r0914o,"Megan Lawton,",2024-07-10 23:11:17,
278,Ugandan TikToker jailed for insulting president,"A Ugandan court has sentenced a 24-year-old man to six years in prison for insulting the president and the first family through his video posted on TikTok. Edward Awebwa was charged with hate speech and spreading ""misleading and malicious"" information against President Yoweri Museveni, First Lady Janet Museveni and son Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is the head of the military. The court also heard that Awebwa had shared abusive information and had said there would be an increase in taxes under President Museveni. He had pleaded guilty and asked for forgiveness. The presiding magistrate said that while he had pleaded for mercy, he did not look remorseful for his actions, and the words used in the video were ""really vulgar"". ""The accused deserves a punishment which will enable him learn from his past so that next time he will respect the person of the president, the first lady and the first son,"" magistrate Stella Maris Amabilis said. He was sentenced to six years for each of the four charges against him, which are to run concurrently. Rights groups regularly denounce Ugandan authorities for violations of human rights and freedom of expression. In 2022, award-winning Ugandan author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija was charged with two counts of ""offensive communication"" after making unflattering remarks about the president and his son on Twitter. He fled the country to Germany after spending a month in jail, where he claimed he had been tortured. Activist and writer Stella Nyanzi, who is also in exile, had earlier been jailed after publishing a poem that was critical against Mr Museveni. President Museveni has been in power since 1986 - 14 years before Awebwa was born. In 2022 he signed into law a against speech which rights groups criticised, saying it was aimed at suppressing freedom of speech online. Last year, the constitutional court ruled that a section of the act that penalised ""offensive communication"" was unconstitutional. Ugandan human rights lawyer Michael Aboneka said Awebwa had been charged under the same broader law that they are still challenging in court because “it is vague”. He told the BBC Newsday programme that the president and his family should expect to be criticised “at whatever angle”. “Unless they are saying that they are going to arrest every Ugandan for criticising them at every point,"" he said.

280,US says Gaza's floating aid pier to shut down soon,"The US says the floating pier designed to increase the amount of aid getting into the Gaza Strip will “soon cease operations”, less than two months after it was installed. The announcement came after the US military were unable to re-anchor the pier this week because of “technical and weather-related issues”. It had to be removed on 28 June because of bad weather. A Pentagon spokesman said more than 8,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been delivered from the pier while it was in operation. He also stressed that it had always been intended as a temporary solution. US officials suggested it would remain in place until August or September, when changing sea states in the Mediterranean might make it impossible to maintain. In fact, the weather proved challenging almost as soon after it started operating on 17 May. For a flagship scheme first announced by President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address in March, the JLOTS (Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore) has had a brief, chequered history. Following stormy weather in late May, four small landing craft involved in the operation broke loose and were washed ashore. Days later, parts of the pier were removed and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs. In mid-June, the whole structure, built by US engineers at a cost of $230m (£178m), was taken to Ashdod, again because of the weather. “Temporarily relocating the pier will prevent structural damage caused by the heightened sea state,” the Pentagon said at the time. The pier was re-anchored on 19 June, but operations paused again, less than a week later, “for scheduled maintenance activities”. The scheme was also buffeted by heavy political weather. When Israeli commandos rescued four hostages from the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp on 8 June, a video showing an Israeli helicopter taking off near the pier triggered speculation on social media that US forces were involved in the rescue. There was no evidence of American involvement, but the Pentagon was forced to issue a strongly worded denial. “The temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only,” it said. “To help move additional, urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza.” America’s role as Israel’s chief military and diplomatic backer meant that the pier was always likely to be the focus of Palestinian suspicions, however unfounded. “When the pier has worked as intended, it supplied Gaza with much needed aid,” one Gaza-based aid worker said. “However... its involvement in perceptions of partiality reduced its sustainability.” For a scheme designed to improve the provision of humanitarian aid, at a time when Israel’s military campaign had left many Gazans on the brink of starvation, what difference did it make? Joe Biden said the pier would “enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day”. At the end of June, US Central Command (Centcom) said more than 8,831 tonnes of aid had been delivered, with more than half of that arriving over the course of the previous week. But it also announced yet another setback, saying that “due to anticipated adverse weather”, the pier had to be moved back to Ashdod once more. It was due to be reinstalled this week to deal with a backlog of aid that has accumulated in Cyprus and on a floating dock moored off the Gaza coastline. But on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj Gen Pat Ryder announced that Centcom personnel were unable to re-anchor the pier to the shore. “The pier and support vessels and equipment are returning to Ashdod where they will remain until further notice. A re-anchoring date has not been set,” he said. He added: “As highlighted in the initial deployment announcement, the pier has always been intended as a temporary solution to enable the additional flow of aid into Gaza during a period of dire humanitarian need, with limited access, supplementing land and air channels of delivery."" ""The pier will soon cease operations, with more details on that process and timing available in the coming days.” The total delivered so far represents a tiny fraction of what is needed. According to the UN, about 500 aid trucks entered Gaza every day before the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October. The comparisons are imprecise, but over the course of two months, the US pier has delivered roughly the equivalent of one day’s pre-war aid delivery. And getting the aid ashore has only been part of the challenge. Delivering it, safely, to the people who need it is extremely hazardous. With Israeli troops this week mounting a fresh ground operation into nearby Gaza City, ensuring safety for aid workers remains as challenging as ever. The breakdown of law and order throughout the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel’s relentless targeting of anyone associated with Hamas, including police officers, means that looting - whether organised or opportunistic - is still rife. Aid that has made it ashore has often remained stuck in the Israeli-controlled marshalling yard, with aid agencies reluctant to collect and distribute it in such an insecure environment.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c725re0g447o,"Paul Adams,",2024-07-11 19:11:17,
282,Srebrenica massacre: 'What happened should be known',"Every July, Sabrija Hajdarevic returns to Srebrenica to visit the graves of her husband and father. They were among around 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys killed in 1995 by the Serb forces. The 67-year-old now lives thousands of miles away in Australia, but the annual trip means a lot to her. This year is even more poignant, as for the first time 11 July will be marked as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration, following a UN General Assembly ruling in May. The Srebrenica massacre, recognised by the UN as a genocide, was the shocking climax of the war in Bosnia - a conflict that erupted after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In Bosnia, one of the countries emerging after the breakup, three communities were in conflict – on the one hand, Bosnian Serbs, backed by Serbia, and, on the other, Bosniaks and Croats. About 40,000 Bosniak Muslims lived in Srebrenica. Many were forced to flee a Bosnian Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-95 war. The town was declared a UN safe zone in 1993 and a small group of international peacekeepers were charged with protecting it from any attacks. But in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces - led by military commander Ratko Mladic - stormed the town, overwhelming the peacekeepers who failed to protect the civilians sheltering there. The Serb forces rounded up the town’s men and boys, most of whom were never seen alive again. They were either killed in droves or murdered when they tried to escape through the wooded hills around Srebrenica. The brutal killing of around 8,000 men and boys became known as Europe's worst mass atrocity since World War Two. The remains of about 1,000 people are still missing. Ratko Mladic was later jailed for life for war crimes, including genocide, and nearly 50 Bosnian Serbs were also convicted. The recent UN resolution, designating 11 July an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide, also condemned any denial of the massacre and glorification of war criminals. But most Bosnian Serbs, as well as many people in Serbia, have repeatedly denied that what had occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 constituted genocide. Sabrija pushes back at claims that the Srebrenica killings were not targeted. “What happened should be known, instead of having all these lies flying around,” she says. “My soul hurts.” Some Bosniak families have been waiting for decades to lay their loved ones to rest, as the identification process is lengthy and difficult. Sabrija was able to bury her husband’s skull - the only body part which was unearthed. Her father’s remains are yet to be found, although she knows he was killed close to their house in Srebrenica as her mother witnessed the killing. Six months after her father’s murder, her mother died, too – “of sorrow,” says Sabrija, fighting back tears. Many victims of the Srebrenica massacre are buried at nearby Potocari cemetery. Thousands of simple white tombstones sit in a field on a slope of a hill, surrounded by woods. Berija Delic also lost her husband in the massacre. His remains were only found a decade later, and were buried in 2010. Last year, Berija decided to return to Srebrenica from Malta, where she sought refuge after the war. Her son, a Muslim, married a Serb Orthodox woman who “loves my baclava,” she says, referring to a sweet delicacy she cooks. Before the 1990s war, Srebrenica was largely a Bosniak Muslim town.  Now, the majority of the population is Serb; some of the residents had been soldiers during the conflict. “Even now you see someone walking around town, and you know that he has killed [Bosniaks] - but you remain silent, you cannot deal with that,” says Berija. Following the war, Bosnia was divided into two entities - Republika Srpska and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska. In the years since the war, the Bosniak population dwindled and the Serb population grew, but now they have one problem in common – unemployment. “Serbs and Bosniaks have no problems between them here, tensions are brought by people from the outside,” says Slavisa Petrovic, a 37-year old Serb who runs the local tourist office. But he says the town needs jobs for people to entice them to stay. The recent UN resolution on the massacre has not changed anything, Slavisa adds. “People are leaving Srebrenica now just like they as they did before it [the adoption of the resolution]. There are no jobs, just like there weren’t before.” There are signs of decline in the town. A once popular local spa and a formerly luxurious hotel are closed, having been abandoned for decades. Their walls are covered in graffiti. The roads leading to neighbouring villages, where farmers with healthy livestock once lived, are overgrown with weeds.  Many local homes are still in ruins. A mosque and a Christian Orthodox are sitting on a hillside overlooking the town, its wartime wounds unhealed. Serb and Bosniak children go to local kindergardens and schools together, and photographs of the new generation are proudly displayed in a public place in the centre of the town.  But it is most likely that the youngsters will soon leave for good. Slavisa is sad that locals keep abandoning the town. ""It feels like they are leaving my house,"" he says. Only three of his classmates are still living in Srebrenica. The rest have moved elsewhere. He, however, is determined to stay.  But even he admits that his four-year-old daughter is unlikely to feel the same when she grows up.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c147wler2vzo,"Natasa Andjelkovic,",2024-07-11 01:11:17,
296,Anderson takes two to help England towards big win,"This video can not be played Anderson bowls West Indies captain Brathwaite for four First Rothesay Test (day two of five), Lord's: West Indies 121 (Atkinson 7-45) & 79-6 (Anderson 2-11) England 371 (Crawley 76, Smith 70, Root 68; Seales 4-77) West Indies trail by 171 runs Scorecard James Anderson took two wickets in his final innings as an international bowler to help put England on course for a huge win over West Indies in the first Test at Lord’s. Anderson, opening the attack for the last time in his record-breaking England career, began the hosts’ hunt for an innings victory by bowling West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite and returned to have Alick Athanaze caught behind. With captain Ben Stokes also taking two wickets and Gus Atkinson two of his own, including Jason Holder off the final ball of the day, West Indies were left 79-6, still 171 short of making England bat again. The tourists had actually done well to bowl England out for 371, but are paying the price for being hustled out for 121 on the opening day. Jamie Smith, England’s wicketkeeper on Test debut, showed why he has such a reputation as a batting talent with an assured 70. Joe Root made a typically elegant 68 and Harry Brook 50, though none of the home top order could capitalise on some good batting conditions with a really big score. Still, England will win this match on a Friday which promises to be an emotional farewell to the legendary Anderson. Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Anderson takes two as England close on victory West Indies' Test problems not solved by money - Lara This video can not be played Mikyle Louis' 'terrific throw' sees Bashir run out for a duck After an opening day of ceremony for Anderson and excitement surrounding the seven-wicket haul of Gus Atkinson, Thursday was relatively low key, with England not having to be at their best to take an iron grip on the contest. Lord’s was splashed with red for the Ruth Strauss Foundation and the fireworks that shot into the sky before play were the only pyrotechnics on display until Smith opened his shoulders late in England’s innings. England began on 189-3, leading by 68. West Indies had a poor first hour, but improved after Brook was dismissed to work through the home batting. England actually lost their last seven wickets for 127 runs, the highlight of which was Mikyle Louis running out Shoaib Bashir with a direct hit from 40 yards, then setting off on a sprinting celebration that culminated with a hug with his brother Jeremiah, who is also in the West Indies squad. West Indies began their second innings straight after tea and, at 37-4, there was a genuine prospect of the first two-day Test on this ground since 1888. Athanaze, Holder and Joshua da Silva did just enough to drag the match into a third day, but surely nothing will prevent England going 1-0 up in the three-match series. This video can not be played Best shots of Smith's 50 Smith has taken over behind the stumps from his county team-mate Ben Foakes, who is Surrey’s first-choice keeper and arguably the best gloveman in the world. England have seen Smith’s potential to bat in different gears, particularly attacking when left with the tail and, on the day before his 24th birthday, he hinted at vindicating their decision. Brook played nicely before flapping at an Alzarri Joseph bouncer, not the first time he has been undone by short bowling, and Stokes registered his fifth successive single-figure score in Tests with a poor shot at a very good delivery from left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie. Smith found an even tempo with Root, who was also bowled by the impressive Motie, then after Chris Woakes and Atkinson fell in quick succession to the second new ball, he cut loose. Favouring the mid-wicket region and keen to use his feet, Smith hit each of Shamar Joseph and Jayden Seales over the leg side for six, the latter an enormous blow on to the roof of the Tavern Stand. From having 30 off his first 47 balls, he took 40 off his next 42. In all, England added 28 runs for the final two wickets, though only Smith scored any runs off the bat until he was well held at deep square leg by Kirk McKenzie to give Seales his fourth wicket. This video can not be played Anderson gets a wonderful reception as he comes out to bat Emerging at number 11, Anderson was given a standing ovation as he made his way to the middle, then even led the players off despite not facing a ball. His unbeaten nought was his 114th not-out in Test cricket, 53 more than anyone else has managed and another of his records that is unlikely to ever be broken. Soon after he was into a typically brilliant opening spell from the Pavilion End, nipping the ball down the slope and through Brathwaite’s defence. Anderson’s first spell of five overs contained four maidens. Woakes was down on pace and gave way to Stokes, who needed only three deliveries to pin McKenzie leg-before for his 200th Test wicket, a milestone that seemed unlikely during his long struggle with a left-knee injury. It made the skipper only the third man in Test cricket, after all-time greats Sir Garfield Sobers and Jacques Kallis, to complete the double of 6,000 runs and 200 wickets, and he celebrated by having Louis caught behind. Atkinson continued his fine game by having Kavem Hodge chop on. Athanaze was defying England in the gloom until he became yet another victim that Anderson has suckered into an edge. Holder faced 59 deliveries for his 20 only to fend Atkinson to short leg from the last ball of the day, leaving Da Silva on eight and Anderson poised to say goodbye. Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan: ""It's been a ruthless display by England. There was all the build-up, all the emotion of Anderson but both debutants have delivered. ""Gus Atkinson yesterday, and Jamie Smith today did his job at the first time of asking. He has been picked to exploit those last few wickets for England and he did that perfectly. ""But West Indies are all over the place. It is so sad to see a batting line-up that's got nothing. They are up against a very good bowling attack including the greatest of all time but it upsets me. The pitch has done a little bit but it's not a pitch you should lose 16 wickets on in the space of two days.""

295,From rough sleeping to advising Prince William,"Sabrina Cohen-Hatton has gone from rough sleeping as a teenager to visiting the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle to give him advice on tackling homelessness. She was able to give her own story to Prince William as proof that homeless people should not be ""written off"". ""I sit in front of you now with a job, a home, a family and a PhD,"" said Sabrina, who works as a fire service chief. Prince William marked the first year of his Homewards project with a visit to Lambeth in south London where he pleged: ""It is possible to end homelessness."" The prince delivered the message that there is nothing inevitable about homelessness and that it shouldn't be normalised. Meeting Homewards representatives in Brixton he said: “Homelessness is a complex societal issue, and one that touches the lives of far too many people in our society. However, I truly believe that it can be ended."" He spoke of the importance of ""shifting perspectives"" about homeless people and the need to ""focus on prevention, rather than simply managing the crisis"". Homewards is a five-year project based around six areas around the UK. That includes Newport in South Wales - and as a 15- and 16-year-old that was where Sabrina was sleeping rough, after the death of a parent and problems at home. Her way out was selling the Big Issue - ""I credit them with saving my life"" - and once she had secure accommodation she was able to get a job in the fire service, which became her career. She used this ""lived experience""  to tell Prince William and the Homewards project about what was needed. ""There were lots of closed doors in my face,"" she said. Even when support was meant to be available, she said in practice it could be hard for homeless people to have the confidence to access it. Or there can be practical barriers. She said she relied on her dog, called Menace, but many hostels wouldn't let people stay with pets. Sabrina also warned of how homelessness was linked to the ""pernicious"" long-term impact of poverty. She went on to become chief fire officer of West Sussex and has spoken widely about her own journey, including this latest role as an advocate for Homewards. Sabrina said Prince William showed a lot of ""empathy"" towards the issue of homelessness, which she suggested reflected some of the ""trauma"" in his early life. At the event in Brixton, Sabrina spoke alongside Chris Lynam, who recalled the intense ""loneliness"" that accompanied his own homelessness and drug addiction. ""It's a very isolating experience... society is quite hostile to homeless people,"" said Chris, who is now supporting Homewards' work in Sheffield. Prince William described it as an ""honour"" to hear Chris talk about his experiences. The homelessness project, operating in Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Lambeth, Newport, Sheffield and Northern Ireland, wants to find successful approaches that can be replicated elsewhere. There are links with employers about helping people into work. A partnership with Homebase provides starter packs of furniture to help those moving from homelessness into accommodation. There are efforts to identify sofa-surfing and addressing links between relationship breakdown and homelessness. Putting housing officers in schools has been tried to identify young people who might be at risk. Through the Duchy of Cornwall there are 24 homes being built with ""wrap-around support"" for people leaving homelessness - and Prince William is now involved in developing further plans. There is a push to change attitudes towards homelessness - and Sabrina talked about the need to get rid of the stigma. She said that for 20 years she hadn't told anyone about her own experiences, before becoming such a public speaker about homelessness. Matt Downie, chief executive of Crisis, says the Homewards project can challenge the ""cynicism and fatalism"" that says homelessness is inevitable. He says that even though the big picture has seen homelessness getting worse, the evidence exists to prevent it. Finland is given as an example of a sustained drive to end homelessness, with the claim that there are now only about 150 homeless families. In contrast in the UK, there are more than 100,000 households categorised as homeless. There have also been questions about whether a wealthy royal should be pronouncing on homelessness. The anti-monarchy group Republic has previously described it as ""crass and hypocritical"". But George Anderson, a Big Issue seller and medical researcher in London, welcomes that Prince William has used his high public profile to talk about homelessness. ""He encourages people who are distant from homelessness to feel empathy and care,"" says George. ""Given the pomp and ceremony around his official role, it is easy for people to question as to what he really knows about homelessness,"" says George. ""I am sure that he is aware of that whilst also knowing he is in a position, like his mother, to highlight the plight of homelessness to the media. ""His mother would have experienced similar, being photographed in a tiara at a ball one day, whilst serving soup in a homeless kitchen the next,"" says George, who sees the prince's interest as being linked to Princess Diana bringing her sons to homelessness charities when they were children.",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1weg5en21wo,"Sean Coughlan,",2024-07-11 13:11:18,
294,Capsey guides England to T20 series win over New Zealand,"This video can not be played England beat New Zealand to seal series win Third women's T20 international, Canterbury New Zealand 141-8 (20 overs): Devine 58* (42); Ecclestone 4-25 England 142-4 (19.2 overs): Capsey 67* (60); Jonas 2-23 England won by six wickets and lead five-match series 3-0 Scorecard Alice Capsey hit an unbeaten 67 as England clinched a tense six-wicket win over New Zealand in the third T20 international to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Sophie Ecclestone's masterful 4-25 helped restrict the Kiwis to 141-8 while Lauren Filer (2-17) and Sarah Glenn (1-14) also bowled eye-catching spells. New Zealand were indebted to skipper Sophie Devine who accelerated in the final few overs to finish unbeaten on 58 off 42 balls after opener Suzie Bates had made 38. England lost in-form Maia Bouchier for a first-ball duck but Capsey and Sophia Dunkley (35) enjoyed a 66-run stand for the second wicket. Nat Sciver-Brunt, skippering the side after Heather Knight was rested, also departed without scoring but 19-year-old Capsey batted with maturity to see England home. With 28 runs required off 17 balls for victory Capsey whacked Amelia Kerr down the ground for a towering six to signal England's charge. Freya Kemp bludgeoned 16 off eight balls before Capsey hit the winning runs - albeit via a streaky shot and misfield - with four balls to spare. The fourth game takes place at Kia Oval on Saturday from 18:30 BST.  This video can not be played Capsey hits Kerr for 'big' six The margin of victory in the previous three one-day internationals and two T20s between the two sides had been so emphatic that England are heading into experimentation territory. In this contest that stretched to Knight sitting out and giving Sciver-Brunt a whirl at skippering the side under the guise of 'what if..?' contingency planning for the T20 World Cup, which takes place in Bangladesh in October.  Should Knight come a cropper in the tournament in Bangladesh the experienced Sciver-Brunt would be a more than capable stand-in – although that was probably already obvious before this match. England also gave opener Danni Wyatt the night off which afforded the talented Dunkley an opportunity at the top as she played her first T20 international since March and her breezy innings gave the hosts a positive start. It was Capsey’s innings that will have pleased England the most, though. The teenager is known for her attacking strokeplay but on occasions her aggressive intent can get the better of her. So the manner in which she batted in Canterbury to get England within striking distance of the total before upping the ante shows a growing maturity to go with her fearless talent. ""I love batting number three it is the best place to bat in T20,"" Capsey told Sky Sports. ""I feel like I have a good understanding of my game. I just want to perform for England so I'm happy to get a performance in today."" It was Capsey's top score in T20s for England - eclipsing knocks of 51 against Sri Lanka and Ireland in 2023.  That it came at a much slower strike-rate - 111.66 - compared to her other three T20 half-centuries does not matter a jot in the bigger picture. England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt: ""With a bowling attack we have got and the people on the sidelines waiting to come in it is a pretty easy job to chuck the ball to different people, so I'm happy I could keep the winning streak going. ""The last few overs were pretty nervy but the calmness they showed was pretty special. ""We don't want to do it all the time but putting ourselves under pressure like that and then come out the other side, if we can take to [the World Cup in] Bangladesh, that would be perfect."" New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine: ""We asked the group to be more competitive, have fight and ticker and we had that. I am really proud of the group - it has been a tough tour so far and to take them so close today was encouraging.  ""Our batters showed intent and were clear on how they wanted to score. To see those learnings is something we've asked for and we're starting to see with this group. I've still got a huge amount of belief in this group but we're working towards the pinnacle event at the end of the year.""

292,England have to be 'perfect' to beat Spain - Southgate,"Gareth Southgate has reached three semi-finals with England  England will have to be ""tactically perfect"" to beat Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final, manager Gareth Southgate says. England's men booked their first appearance in a major final on foreign soil with a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in their semi-final on Wednesday.  It's the third time in the past four major competitions that Southgate has guided England to the semi-final stage of either the Euros or the World Cup.  Southgate says three-time winners Spain are the ""favourites"" for the final as England's men bid to win their first Euros title.  ""They would be rightly favourites for what they have done this tournament. They have been the best team,"" said Southgate.  “They have got a day longer and in the past three finals, maybe more, it has been quite significant, so we have got to get our recovery spot on. “Tactically we will have to be perfect as they are such a good side. But, you know, we are here."" Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice says England's defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final will serve as motivation on Sunday. Italy beat England 3-2 on penalties at Wembley after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes in London. ""Seeing Italy lift that trophy will haunt me forever,"" said Rice. ""We are now presented with another opportunity where we can write our own history but we are up against another top side who we have to massively respect. ""Hopefully now we can do it. Not only for each other but also for the manager. I think he deserves it."" Chelsea's Cole Palmer said the side can ""finish the job"" and change their lives forever by winning in Berlin.  Palmer came off the bench to provide the assist for fellow substitute Ollie Watkins' last-minute winner in Dortmund.  ""Everyone's buzzing,"" the midfielder told the England YouTube channel.  ""Last night on the bus, tunes were on, [in the] changing room, everyone was just enjoying it. ""But obviously it's a short turnaround and it's a massive, massive game to change our lives, our family's lives, and to make everyone proud. That's what we're trying to do.  ""I think if you've got to this final then you have to hopefully finish the job. It's all good getting to the final, and you've got to enjoy it because you don't get many moments to enjoy. But, no, everyone just wants to win so bad.""

Palmer, who won the European Championship at Under-21 level with England in 2023, feels the Three Lions have found their rhythm.  ""In the first few games, we didn't play the best that we could and everyone knew that,"" added Palmer. ""But now I think as the tournament's gone on, especially yesterday, I think we had our best game in the tournament, and that's what you want going into the later stages. ""It's huge. We played them last year in the Under-21s final, England versus Spain.

291,Tori Towey 'so relieved' to be in Ireland after Dubai ordeal,"A woman charged with criminal offences in Dubai after she was allegedly a victim of domestic violence has said she is ""so relieved... thankful and grateful"" to have returned to Ireland. Tori Towey, 28, faced charges including attempted suicide and consuming alcohol and had her passport destroyed. Her flight from Dubai landed in Dublin at 12:21 local time. ""I'm just so relieved, I just I can't believe it,"" Ms Towey told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Ms Towey added that the support of the Irish people and the media had been amazing. And, now she plans to see her family and friends. But first of all, Ms Towey said she is going to ""go home and rest"" after an ordeal she described as ""tiring"". Ms Towey, from County Roscommon, was working as a flight attendant with an airline based in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when she was charged with attempting suicide and consuming alcohol. Her case prompted an intervention by Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris earlier this week after it was raised in the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament). Police in the UAE withdrew the charges against her on Wednesday and a travel ban was lifted. Ms Towey said she was ""so thankful and grateful to be back"" and spoke of her fear of not being able to return to Ireland. ""Obviously when my mother came out to me it was a massive help, but it was just the unknown and just not knowing anything, not knowing what's going to happen,"" she said. ""It's only kind of between yesterday and today that I kind of got clarity. I wasn't getting any answers, but I'm just glad to be back."" Ms Towey was speaking at the airport beside her mother, Caroline, and aunt Ann Flynn. Caroline said it is ""great to have her home"" and described the ordeal as ""a nightmare, a real nightmare"".  Ms Towey's mother said the plan now is to ""go home and get our heads together and move on"". Her case drew attention in Ireland when it was raised in the Dáil by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Tuesday. ""She has been the victim of the most gross domestic violence,"" Ms McDonald said. ""Her passport has been destroyed. There was a travel ban imposed on her."" The Irish government should make it ""absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way"", Ms McDonald told the Dáil, and that ""an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way"". The taoiseach thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention and said he was ready to ""intervene"". Mr Harris said her treatment had been ""utterly, utterly unacceptable"". He went on to say Ms Towey had ""been the victim of male violence"". ""What Tori has been through is, I think, unimaginable for so many people here in this country, that a woman who has been the victim of a brutal attack found herself waking up not in a hospital, but in a police station,"" Mr Harris added. On Wednesday, the taoiseach told the Dáil that a travel ban preventing Ms Towey from leaving the UAE had been lifted and Irish embassy staff would be escorting Ms Towey to the airport. After her arrival in Dublin Airport on Thursday afternoon, Ms Towey thanked the taoiseach, Ms McDonald, Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin and the Irish ambassador to the UAE. She also thanked human rights advocate and lawyer Radha Stirling from Detained in Dubai, who assisted her case.",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84j1r3pxk1o,Unknown,2024-07-11 16:11:18,
293,The marathon Indian wedding turning heads around the world,"How much is too much? That's the question many in India are asking as the months-long wedding festivities for the youngest son of Asia's richest man enter their final phase. The celebrations are expected to culminate this weekend when Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, ties the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant.   There have been four months of lavish events leading up to the wedding itself. All the glamourous outfits, stunning jewellery, fairytale-like decor and rare performances by Indian and global stars have been the focus of much public attention. ""It is nothing short of a royal wedding,"" says writer and columnist Shobhaa De. ""Our billionaires are the new Indian maharajahs. Their shareholders expect nothing less than a mega extravaganza."" Indians ""have always loved pomp and pageantry - just like the British"", she says, adding that ""the scale [of the wedding] is in keeping with the Ambani wealth"". But the hullabaloo around the wedding has drawn as much ire as public fascination. Many have criticised the opulence and the sheer magnitude of wealth on display in a country where tens of millions live below the poverty line and where income inequality is extreme.  ""[The wedding] can easily be seen as a kind of a mockery, a sort of blindness to the reality of the country at one level. At another level, however ridiculous this might be, it is still in keeping with the grossly distorted, almost grotesque bloating of Indian weddings in the last decade or so,"" writer and commentator Santosh Desai tells the BBC. ""It is part of a larger shift that is taking place. A generation or two ago, wealth was spoken of in whispers. Today, wealth must speak as loudly as possible. Even then, the scale of this wedding makes it an outlier.""  With a sprawling business empire - ranging from oil, telecoms, chemicals, technology and fashion to food - the Ambanis are a ubiquitous presence in India and their lives are the subject of intense public fascination. Mr Ambani's personal fortune is estimated at a staggering $115bn (£90bn). Anant, 29, holds a position on the Reliance Industries board of directors. Ambani senior, along with fellow Indian business tycoon Gautam Adani, is reported to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, with opposition parties accusing the authorities of unduly favouring the two business houses - accusations both the government and the businessmen deny. While the Ambani family’s enormous wealth and clout are well known in India, many outside the country may not have realised the extent of their riches until now. That changed in March, when Mr Ambani hosted a three-day pre-wedding party for his son. The festivities were held in the family's hometown Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, which is also the location of Mr Ambani's oil refinery - the largest in the world. Some 1,200 guests attended, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates. The party began with a dinner held inside a glasshouse especially built for the occasion. The stunning structure reportedly resembles Palm House, a crystalline Victorian-style building located in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which was a favourite of Ms Merchant when she was a college student in New York City. The feast was followed by a performance by Rihanna and viral videos showed the Ambani family grooving with the popstar on stage. If people hadn't been paying attention, they definitely were now. Through it all, dozens of speciality chefs served some 2,000 dishes, carefully curated from around the world, to guests lodged in luxury tents, with personal makeup artists and stylists at their service.  There was also a 10-page manual on the dress code for the events, which included a ""jungle fever"" theme for a visit to a family-owned animal sanctuary, followed by a Moulin Rouge-themed ""house party"" held at the sprawling grounds of their palatial residence. The bride-to-be wore a number of specially crafted outfits, including two lehngas (long bridal silk skirts) - one studded with 20,000 Swarovski crystals and another that reportedly took 5,700 hours to make - and a pink version of a Versace dress that actor Blake Lively wore to the 2022 Met Gala.  The groom mostly wore Dolce & Gabbana outfits and flaunted a Richard Mille wristwatch, worth an estimated $1.5m. A viral video of Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan gawking at the watch went viral in India. Newspapers and websites perfectly captured the opulence of these dazzling events, attended by the glitterati from around the world. ""It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,"" the New York Times reported. There was also backlash after India's government overnight designated the city's small airport into an international airport, expanded its staff and deployed military and air force personnel in service of the family. The final night of the three-day jamboree, which ended with a shower of confetti, fireworks and a lightshow, set the tone for what was to come next. In June, the couple and their guests took their pre-wedding celebrations overseas, literally. The party, which included top Bollywood stars, embarked on a luxury cruise along the stunning azure coastline of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy, to the French Mediterranean.  They stopped in Rome, Portofino, Genoa and Cannes for late-night revelry that reportedly brought complaints from local people. This time, the celebrations had performances by 90s teen heartthrobs The Backstreet Boys, singer Katy Perry and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. This week, yet another set of wedding celebrations kicked off on the family's home turf, Mumbai, with a performance by Justin Bieber. A video of him singing at the edge of the stage as the bride and her friends sing along has been viewed 38 million times. It shows ecstatic women in sequined gowns and saris as they punch their fists skyward in glee. The crowd doesn't miss a beat to Bieber's verse: You should go and love yourself. The scale of the celebrations show that nothing is out of reach for the family. And there is speculation that Adele could be performing at the actual wedding this weekend - the family, however, are tight-lipped. Of course, India isn't a stranger to the concept of big fat weddings - the country is the largest spender on marriage ceremonies after the US.  Tina Tharwani, co-founder of the Shaadi Squad, says in recent years, there's been a noticeable trend where weddings have become larger-than-life events that veer towards excessiveness, driven by societal expectations, competitive displays of status, and a desire to create memorable moments. So, we've seen expensive weddings routinely make headlines in recent years, such as this $74m wedding in 2016. Other Ambani children have also had lavish pre-wedding festivities. Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among attendees at Isha Ambani's pre-wedding bash in 2018, which featured a performance by Beyoncé. A year later, Akash Ambani's pre-wedding bash featured a performance by Coldplay. When it comes to scale, though, this is the mother of all weddings, says Ashwini Arya, owner of an event management company that has managed weddings in 14 countries.  ""It's like the bible for the industry with the best of logistics, tech, design and grandeur. ""You're talking about preparations of a minimum of two years, multiple recce trips, approvals and permissions from several countries, along with the logistics of arranging security and transport for some of the biggest personalities of the world,"" he says. The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them but Mr Arya estimates that they ""have already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m]"". It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Bieber is $10m.  Money was also lavished on constructing 14 temples inside a sprawling complex in Jamnagar to showcase India's cultural heritage and provide a backdrop for the wedding. As part of the celebrations, the Ambanis hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples too.  It's being said the family pulled out all the stops because with all the Ambani children married, this would be their last wedding for the foreseeable future.  But with each event, public criticism of the celebration in India has grown - from people aghast at the massive jewels worn by Nita Ambani to exasperation and anger among Mumbai residents over traffic restrictions in a city already struggling with traffic jams and monsoon flooding. For India's wedding industry though, it’s still an exciting marketing opportunity.

289,Paolini edges out Vekic in thriller to reach final,"This video can not be played Paolini beats Vekic in semi-final thriller Jasmine Paolini edged out a tearful Donna Vekic in a thrilling semi-final to become the first Italian to reach a Wimbledon women's singles final. In one of the best matches of the tournament, Paolini missed two match points and was 8-7 behind in the 10-point tie-break before recovering to clinch an incredible victory. The match lasted two hours 51 minutes, making it the longest women's singles semi-final at Wimbledon, with the Italian winning 2-6 6-4 7-6 (10-8). Seventh seed Paolini will now face Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova after she claimed a remarkable 3-6 6-3 6-4 comeback victory against Elena Rybakina, the 2022 champion. It means there will be a new name etched into the Venus Rosewater Dish following Saturday's final. Paolini, who had never won a match at this tournament before this year but who has gained huge popularity with her enthusiasm, bubbly personality and incredible shot-making skills, said: ""I was serving really bad so I am so happy. This match I will remember forever. “I was just trying to think about what to do on the court, point by point, because I was really in difficulty.” Vekic, who was also struggling with an injury to her lower right arm, was seen in tears at the changeover before the tie-break as the match was slipping away from her. ""I thought I was going to die in the third set,"" said a tearful Vekic in the post-match news conference. ""I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg. It was not easy out there, but I will recover. ""I was more crying because I had so much pain, I didn't know how I could keep playing. My team tells me I can be proud of myself.  ""It's tough right now. It's really tough to be positive right now. It was so close."" 'Emotional, cruel, euphoric' - the incredible semi-final 'I miss her so much' - Krejcikova remembers Novotna GB's Hewett into semi-finals despite shoulder injury This video can not be played Paolini reacts as she reaches first Wimbledon final Paolini lost in the French Open final in May and is the first woman to reach back-to-back Roland Garros and Wimbledon finals since Serena Williams in 2016. “I think these last months have been crazy for me,” added Paolini. “I don’t know, I am just trying to focus on what I have to do on court and enjoying what I am doing. “I love playing tennis. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid at Wimbledon. I am just enjoying it and trying to live in the present.” The 28-year-old Italian had lost all three of her matches here before this year, but has now created history - and has a chance of becoming the first Italian player, male or female, to win a Wimbledon singles title. Paolini had never reached the second week of a Grand Slam until six weeks ago when she made the French Open final. But she has quickly become a fans' favourite, with every successful point won against Vekic gaining a huge reception, with the majority of supporters cheering on the Italian. Paolini seemed to thrive on that support and the energy around Centre Court as Vekic struggled against her opponent and the crowd, which gave a deserved standing ovation to both players. Donna Vekic is set to move up to 21st in the world rankings, only two places off her best ever position, following her run to the Wimbledon semi-finals Croat Vekic, also aiming to reach her first Grand Slam final, stormed through the first set and then led 4-3 with a break of serve in the deciding set, needing only two holds of serve for victory. But amid sensational scenes on Centre Court, the hugely popular Paolini managed to instantly get the match back on serve. She failed to convert a match-point chance in the 10th game and then another two games later as the encounter went to a 10-point tie-break.  Vekic led 8-7 in that, as the lead had constantly changed hands and was two points from victory, but Paolini, chasing down every ball and able to unleash wonderfully-accurate forehand shots, went ahead and then kept her nerve to seal the win. Just a month ago, Vekic, 28, was on the verge of quitting tennis, having struggled with a run of injuries. But the world number 37 had found a golden run of form which could have rescued her career, with her set to move up 16 places in the rankings. Vekic was aiming to become the second successive unseeded player winning the women's tournament after Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic became the first female player to ever do so when she lifted the trophy 12 months ago. Vekic played a full part in a thrilling match that will live long in the memory, but Paolini was the one who was celebrating at the dramatic end. This video can not be played Barbora Krejcikova pays tribute to inspiration Jana Novotna after win Rybakina had fast become the favourite for the women's singles title at Wimbledon following a flurry of high-profile exits earlier in the tournament. After Paolini and Vekic played out the longest women's semi-final at Wimbledon, it looked like the 25-year-old would make quick work of Thursday's second match on Centre Court when she raced to a 4-0 lead before snapping up the first set. But Krejcikova struck back in the second and, with the crowd behind her, she needed just a single break of serve to take control of the decider. The 31st seed shot her arms into the air in celebration when fourth seed Rybakina fired long on the first match point. ""I am so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today,"" Krejcikova said. Asked if she ever believed she would reach a Wimbledon singles final, she said ""no, never"" before paying tribute to 1998 Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, who coached Krejcikova before she died in 2017 at the age of 49. ""I am fighting for every ball and I am sure that is what she would want me to do,"" she added. It is the first time Krejcikova - a doubles specialist - has reached a Wimbledon singles final, and her first at a Grand Slam since she triumphed at the French Open in 2021. It marks a remarkable return to form for the 28-year-old, who had a far-from-perfect build-up to Wimbledon - winning just three matches in the five months before the Championships after struggling with a back injury and illness.",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cqv53y38z07o,Michael Emons and Emily Salley,2024-07-11 23:11:18,
288,Man Utd close to £33.7m deal for striker Zirkzee,"Joshua Zirkzee made his first Netherlands appearance at Euro 2024 after replacing injured midfielder Frenkie de Jong Manchester United are close to completing a £33.7m deal to sign Dutch striker Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna. United sources say the club are set to pay a slight premium on the £33.67m release clause in order to secure an extended payment period for the 23-year-old. The Premier League club are determined to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) regards loss limits and accept their present situation is tight and will require discipline in their transfer dealings. Long-serving forward Anthony Martial left Old Trafford at the end of last season when his contract expired. The Frenchman’s extended absence because of injury, in addition to Marcus Rashford’s drop in form, left new signing Rasmus Hojlund to shoulder the striking burden.  Van Nistelrooy returns to Man Utd in coaching reshuffle Dutchman Van de Beek joins Girona from Man Utd  Hojlund ended up losing his place in Ten Hag’s starting line-up for the FA Cup final win over Manchester City as the manager used Bruno Fernandes in a false nine role. Zirkzee joined Bayern Munich from Feyenoord in 2017 before moving to Bologna for about £7.15m five years later after loan spells with Parma and Anderlecht. He scored 12 goals in 37 appearances last season as Bologna claimed a surprise spot in this season’s Champions League. Zirkzee was named in Ronald Koeman’s Euro 2024 squad but made just two substitute appearances for the Netherlands, totalling four minutes, plus injury time. He was introduced into Wednesday’s semi-final defeat by England immediately after Ollie Watkins’ winner.

287,England on 'brink of history' - Lineker,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Everything will be crossed for England - Lineker Former England striker Gary Lineker says Gareth Southgate's side are on the ""brink of history"" after reaching the Euro 2024 final. The Three Lions beat the Netherlands 2-1 in Dortmund on Wednesday night to book a spot in Sunday's final against Spain. It is the first time the men's side have reached a final outside England after playing the 1966 World Cup final and 2021 Euro final at Wembley, while the women's Euro victory in 2022 came on home soil. England's men have never won the European Championship, with their World Cup win in 1966 their only major silverware, while Spain are three-time European champions. ""I think it's hugely significant for English football,"" Lineker, who will present BBC One's coverage of the final on Sunday, told BBC Sport. ""They were in a final, they were in the last final of the Euros, of course, and that was at Wembley, and that ended up in huge disappointment [losing to Italy on penalties]. ""This is going to be tough, it's going to be difficult, but they're on the brink of history. No English team in football has ever won a major tournament abroad."" The closest a senior England team have come to winning a major tournament outside of England was in 2023, when the Lionesses were beaten by Spain in the World Cup final in Australia. Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in Dortmund on Wednesday but Harry Kane equalised from the penalty spot midway through the first half before Ollie Watkins scored the winner in the 90th minute. Watkins' winner was England's fourth goal of the tournament scored past the 80th minute, including extra time. ""They have got that kind of never-say-die attitude, which is something that is hugely important,"" said Lineker, who scored 48 goals in 80 appearances for England. ""Even when they weren't playing great, they were grinding out results. And it's an old football cliche that if you can win when you play badly, then things are not that bad."" Gary Lineker was capped 80 times by England  Spain have been in the eyes of many observers the outstanding team in Germany this summer and are favourites heading into Sunday's final. After a slow start, England have found some rhythm in the knockout stages and the win against the Netherlands was their best display of the tournament so far. ""I don't really think I'm surprised at how we have done it, because we've got the individuals, world-class footballers right across the pitch,"" Lineker continued. ""Yes, they started slowly and something wasn't quite right about things but they've worked it out and they've got gradually better as the tournament progressed. It's much better that way round."" So, is football coming home? ""I'm banning that statement,"" said Lineker. ""It's been bad luck for so long.""

286,Baltimore bridge survivor describes horror of collapse,"The sole survivor of the Baltimore bridge disaster has told how he watched friends and relatives fall from the structure and die as he fought for his own life. ""I relive it all the time, the minutes before the fall and when I'm falling,"" Julio Cervantes Suarez told NBC News in his first interview since the 100,000-ton cargo ship, the Dali, crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge on 26 March.  Mr Cervantes Suarez, 37, was one of seven maintenance workers fixing potholes at the time of impact. The force threw the van he was in off the structure and into the the Patapsco river around 180ft (50m) below. He said he prepared for death. ""I thanked God for the family he gave me. I asked him to take care of my wife and kids. And I asked for forgiveness,"" he said in an interview in Spanish.  He struggled in vain to open the doors as water rose to his neck, then managed to force a window open - squeezing out just before the vehicle sank. Unable to swim, he clung to a piece of wreckage and waited for rescue.  ""That's when I realised what happened. I looked at the bridge and it was no longer there,"" he said.  Mr Cervantes Suarez said he saw co-workers - some of whom were family - as ""the water covered them"".  ""I started to call out to each by name,"" he said. ""But no one answered me."" The first to fall was his nephew, Carlos Daniel Hernández, who was in a car when the Dali smashed into the bridge.  Mr Cervantes Suarez said he had told the 24-year-old, whom he considered a son, to take a break in the vehicle. ""If I had told him to come with me, maybe it would have been different,"" he said.  ""Maybe he would be here with us."" The other victims were:  The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after the Dali  lost power, veered off course and smashed into the structure. Rescuers searched the waters for days to recover the bodies of all the victims.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. A lawyer for Mr Cervantes Suarez and other victims told NBC that he was considering legal action against the Dali's Singapore-based owner, Grace Ocean.  Mr Cervantes Suarez said he wanted those responsible to ""pay"" for the damage, but said he knew that it would not bring back his loved ones and co-workers.  ""I know that money is not going to buy a hug from a father or a son,"" he said. ",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51ykdlg08do,"Madeline Halpert,",2024-07-11 15:11:18,
290,Girmay wins again as Roglic crashes and loses time,"Biniam Girmay now leads the green jersey points classification by a huge 111 points History-maker Biniam Girmay sprinted to his third victory at this year's Tour de France but overall contender Primoz Roglic lost significant time after a late crash on stage 12. Eritrean Girmay became the first black African to win a Tour de France stage with his opening win on stage three and also triumphed on stage eight. Intermarche-Wanty rider Girmay, 24, beat Wout van Aert in a frantic bunch sprint in Villeneuve-sur-Lot, with Mark Cavendish originally finishing fifth before being relegated. Tadej Pogacar retained the leader's yellow jersey and remains one minute six seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard a further eight seconds behind. But podium contender Roglic, who finished with a ripped jersey and bloodied shoulder, dropped from fourth to sixth in the general classification after he lost two minutes 27 seconds on the leaders after being caught up in a late crash. Pogacar, of UAE Team Emirates, was also held up behind a crash in the peloton early in the stage, and required a bike change, but re-joined the main group without issue. The 203.6km route from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot offered one of the few remaining opportunities for a bunch sprint - assuming the sprinter's teams could control any potential breakaway. A four-man group featuring Groupama-FDJ riders Valentin Madouas and Quentin Pacher, Jonas Abrahamsen of Uno-X Mobility and Total Energies' Anthony Turgis managed to open up a three-and-a-half-minute advantage over the peloton. But that move was shut down with more than 40km remaining to set up a long-inevitable dash to the line, in which Girmay prevailed to further assert himself as the fastest sprinter at this year's race. In doing so he also extended his lead in the green jersey points battle, opening up a likely unassailable 111-point advantage over Jasper Philipsen. ""The green jersey gives me wings - I feel super fast. It's in the head. I've had my ups and downs in recent seasons but I changed things this year and it's working,"" Girmay said. A rare moment of calm in the peloton was interrupted with 12km remaining when Alexey Lutsenko crashed and took down Slovenian Roglic. The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe rider had been one minute 31 seconds adrift of the podium but that deficit now stands at three minutes 28 seconds. Reacting to Roglic's incident, race leader Pogacar said: ""It is really devastating. He was in very good shape already and I could feel he was getting better with every stage.  ""I’m pretty sure he would have been fighting for the GC in the next few days."" Both Astana Qazaqstan rider Cavendish and Arnaud Demare, of Arkea-B&B Hotels, were relegated following illegal moves they made in the sprint. Stage 13 on Friday is a relatively flat 165.3km route from Agen to Pau but, as the race enters the Pyrenees, hilly terrain approaching the finish could prove difficult for the sprinters. That is one of only two expected remaining opportunities for the sprinters - including Cavendish, who claimed a record 35th Tour de France stage win last week - to take victories at this year's race, along with stage 16 in Nimes.

298,Many Democrats are sticking with Biden. Here's why,"Headlines scream for Joe Biden to quit. Donors threaten to withhold campaign funds, and a growing list of Democrats call time on the president's career. But for all the stories dominated by the latest politician, fundraiser or left-wing actor to voice their displeasure, a longer list of Democrats are sticking by him. At least 80 Democratic politicians have publicly backed the 81-year-old, and more are joining them as he insists he is going nowhere.  To many, his political record, his principles and his 2020 victory over Donald Trump mean more than the damage of a rambling performance in any debate or public appearance, or health fears during a new four-year term. Mr Biden's first solo news conference of the year on Thursday, though hampered by mistakes, sparked several more public expressions of support. “Tonight, President Biden was knowledgeable, engaging, and capable,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on social media afterwards. “No one is more prepared to lead our nation forward than Joe Biden.” Gavin Newsom, the California governor touted as a possible successor, told CBS on Friday he was ""all in"" for Mr Biden, adding that there was ""no daylight"" between them. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said Mr Biden ""showed he knows a million times more about policy"" than Trump, ""the convict conman"". Experts say these politicians have a host of reasons for their support, including Mr Biden's record in office, his 2020 victory against Trump and the gamble of putting in a new candidate so close to the November election.  ""The president has made it clear he wants to continue to run, and I think people are being very respectful of that,"" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist. ""And it's also true that in our system, replacing a candidate for president this late is hard and is unprecedented, and so there's enormous reticence about making a big change."" He added that there was a ""healthy debate"" about who the nominee should be. However, a range of groups have said that the candidate should be Mr Biden, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr Biden met earlier this week.  Ameshia Cross, a former Obama campaign adviser, said that the black caucus, as well as many black voters, see Mr Biden as a president committed to civil rights, unlike his rival, Trump.  ""They understand what is at stake with a Donald J Trump presidency,"" she said. ""This is a guy who has stood against DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.""  Mr Biden has received public support from several politicians on the left, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have previously criticised Mr Biden for an agenda they have said is not progressive enough.  Ms Cross said many recognise the risks a Trump presidency brings to civil and LGBTQ rights, and climate change. ""These are things that matter to the progressive left, and the president has actually worked on those things,"" she said.  To date, most of Mr Biden's support comes from politicians running for re-election in safer districts, rather than those who worry Mr Biden could harm their own election chances in tougher seats. Mr Rosenberg said that the White House ""needs to be respectful of their concerns and deal with them, I think, in a far more aggressive manner"". Even as calls grow for Mr Biden to exit the race, the most recent poll seems to suggest that he has not lost much voter support.  The Biden campaign has touted a survey from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos published this week, which shows Mr Biden and Trump in a dead-heat, similar to survey results from before the debate. But the poll also found two-thirds of Americans want Mr Biden to step aside.  Mr Biden has also lost support from some donors, including Democratic fundraiser and actor George Clooney, who wrote a damning op-ed this week calling on Mr Biden to step down.  Other top donors, however, are sticking by the president.  Shekar Narasimhan, who has been organising fundraisers for Democrats for more than two decades, said there had been no change in his plans. ""Our eyes can see what’s going on, our ears can hear what's being talked about but we are keeping our heads down to get the work done,"" said Mr Narsimhan, who is the founder of the Asian American Pacific Islander Victory Fund Super-PAC. ""It's the president’s decision to make, whether he wants to run or not, and we will go with whatever he decides,"" he said. ""But it's better to end this discussion as soon as possible."" He said his support for Mr Biden came from the belief that he would win. ""This election will be decided by no more than a total of 50,000 votes in three states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - and we have the ground game and infrastructure to win there,"" he said. Frank Islam, who sits on the National Finance Committee, said he had a fundraiser planned at his Maryland home later this month. ""I am absolutely going ahead with it because I know he [Mr Biden] will win,"" he said.",2024-07-12 23:09:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4y3xd4r1po,"Madeline Halpert & Brajesh Upadhyay,",2024-07-12 19:09:06,

311,Death and rubble fill streets of Tal Al-Sultan as rescuers dodge Israeli fire,"The things they see. The dead girl lowered by a rope from a ruined building. She sways slightly, then comes to rest, legs folding beneath her on the rubble. They see people and parts of people lying out in the open where the blast or the bullet caught them. Violent death in all of its contortions. Bodies lying in the streets, in the blasted open sitting rooms of houses, under the rubble. Sometimes covered by so much concrete the men will never reach them, and only in the future when the war is over will somebody come and give them a decent burial. The men of the Gaza Civil Defence cannot close their eyes to any of this. There is no shutting out the smell. Every sense is on alert. Death can come from the skies in an instant.  When the fighting in places like Shejaiya in eastern Gaza City, or Tal Al-Sultan, near Rafah, in the south, is as fierce as it has been in the last few days, the ambulances of the Civil Defence dare not venture out. “Entering areas close to the Israeli occupation is dangerous, but we try to intervene to save lives and souls,” says Muhammed Al Mughayer, a local Civil Defence official. He and his men seize any lull in the conflict to recover the dead and the wounded. Families constantly ask about missing relatives. “It is very difficult to identify the bodies,” explains Mr Mughayer. “Some remain unidentified due to complete decomposition.”  Stray animals also prey on the corpses, tearing off clothes and scattering papers that might be used to identify them. The ambulance crews are short of fuel. Two days ago one broke down in Tal Al-Sultan and had to be towed out, a nerve-wracking experience for the crews. The risk of being fired on by the Israeli forces, says Mr Mughayer, means seriously injured people often cannot be rescued. “There is currently a report of an injured person near Al-Salihin Mosque from two days ago, but we can't reach them due to delays in coordination. It may result in their death.” Refugees are continuing to flee from Gaza city and areas like Shejaiya. Many have been displaced multiple times.  For them it is a world without laws or rules. World leaders express concern. But nobody is coming to rescue them. Nothing is more acute for these people than the sense that they can die at any moment. Sharif Abu Shanab stands outside the ruins of his family home in Shejaiya with an expression that is part bewilderment, part grief. ""My house had four floors, and I can't enter it,” he says. “I can't take anything out of it, not even a can of tuna. We have nothing, no food or drink. They bulldozed all the houses, and it is not our fault. Why do they hold us accountable for the fault of others? What did we do? We are citizens. Look at the destruction around you… ""Where do we go, and to whom? We are thrown in the streets now, we have no home or anything, where do we go? There is only one solution and that is to hit us with a nuclear bomb and relieve us of this life."" There are occasional glimpses of reprieve. The Al-Fayoumi family, arriving close to Deir Al Balah in central Gaza, were relieved to have escaped from Gaza City. This after a warning this week to evacuate from the Israel Defense Forces sent thousands of people onto the road south. In the boiling heat of the asphalt road, without shade, family members were reunited with others who had gone ahead of them. The new arrivals were given water and soft drinks. A boy sucked from a carton of juice, then squeezed it with all his strength to coax out a last few drops. Nobody in the group took their survival for granted. So to see everyone alive, all in the one place, brought smiles and cries of happiness. An aunt reached into a car to hug her young niece. At first the child smiled. Then she turned her head and sobbed. Where will they be tomorrow, next week, next month? They have no way of knowing. It depends on where the fighting moves next, on the next Israeli evacuation order, on the mediators and whether Hamas and Israel can agree a ceasefire. These lines could have been written at any time in the last few months. Civilians dying. Taking to the roads. Hunger. Hospitals struggling. Talks about a ceasefire. Since February, we have been following the story of Nawara al-Najjar whose husband Abed-Alrahman was among more than 70 people killed when Israeli forces launched an operation to rescue two hostages in Rafah.  They had fled Khan Younis 9km (6 miles) to the north, and took refuge closer to Rafah when bullets and shrapnel tore through the tented camp where they slept. Nawara was six months pregnant when she was widowed, and taking care of six children, aged from four to 13. When a BBC colleague found her again today, Nawara was nursing her newborn baby, Rahma, just one month old. She gave birth on a night of heavy airstrikes, rushed to the hospital by her in-laws. “I kept saying: ‘Where are you Abed-Alrahman? This is your daughter coming into the world without a father.’"" Baby Rahma has red hair like her dead father. The Israeli advance into Rafah last month sent Nawara and her children fleeing again, back to their old home in Khan Younis.

310,Hackers steal call records of 'nearly all' AT&T customers,"Hackers stole call and text records data from ""nearly all"" of 109 million AT&T Wireless customers, the telecommunications company disclosed on Friday.  The firm said one suspect had been arrested after the records - from May to October 2022 - were illegally downloaded and copied to a third-party platform this April. The stolen data did not contain the content of calls or texts, but did record the numbers contacted, as well as the number and lengths of interactions, the company said. The Justice Department said the delayed announcement of the hack was justified on national security grounds. “We sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care,” AT&T said in a statement. The company said in its filing to the securities and exchange commission it had secured its systems from further similar hacks and did not believe what was stolen was publicly available. It said it first learned of the breach five days after hackers started stealing data on 14 April. They continued to do so until 25 April, the company said. Experts have warned that the information could be used to identify work places, approximate home locations, as well as potential colleagues and friends. The breach comes months after AT&T disclosed  that data from 2019 of 73 million former and current customers had been stolen and placed on the ""dark web"" by fraudsters. AT&T said it would alert affected customers. Users could also log into their account to see if their data was affected, and request a report that would provide a more ""user-friendly"" version showing what was compromised. It warned users to be cautious about email or text requests that ask for personal information.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yemmmg9mo,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-12 18:09:07,

308,Eight photos that make us question what we see,"""The effect that scares me most is not that we'll be fooled by fake photos but that we'll ignore the real ones"" – how photographers are dealing with shifting perceptions of reality. It seemed unlikely that the Pope would wear a puffer jacket or that Nigel Farage would play Minecraft, but Katy Perry making a big entrance at the Met Gala or Rishi Sunak pouring a bad pint appeared entirely plausible. In fact, all of these images were fake. ""I think it's getting harder to know what is true,"" says Jago Cooper, the director of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich, which is part-way through a six-month series of interlinked exhibitions based around the question What is Truth? It's a theme that's being taken up by a number of museums. In Maastricht, Fotomuseum aan het Vrijthof's Truth is Dead is currently displaying Alison Jackson's amusingly misleading photographs of celebrities, for example; while Foam Amsterdam is exploring how the intersection of art and technology can change our perception of reality with Photography Through the Lens of AI. ""People genuinely want to know how they know what is true in the world today,"" says Cooper. ""Truth is so hard to find and it's a really interesting question."" Unsurprising, then, that it's become a prevalent theme for many contemporary artists, eager to open up conversations about the trustworthiness of visual media. One such artist is the Irish film-maker and photographer Richard Mosse. His photograph Poison Glen (2012) from The Enclave series features in the Sainsbury's Centre's newest exhibition The Camera Never Lies: Challenging images through the Incite Project. The eastern Congolese landscape in the frame ought to appear as green as the Donegal valley it is named for, but by using infrared film, a device normally intended to reveal information, Mosse has instead deceived us. A landscape populated by armed rebels, who are part of a conflict which has cost over 5 million lives, is turned an inviting sugar pink: the nightmare now looks like a fairytale. Also in The Camera Never Lies – which re-evaluates the most iconic images of the past 100 years – is Stuart Franklin's The Tank Man (1989). In the photo, a lone protester in Beijing's Tiananmen Square stands in the path of tanks just minutes after the Chinese authorities gunned down anti-corruption and pro-reform demonstrators. Over time, different truths have been attached to the image – a key part of the exhibition's purpose, exploring how photos have become the memory bank of our lives and how far they are a true reflection of history or merely the images that form our perception of it. Initially, Franklin told Vice in 2020, the captured moment was ""a very useful event politically ... because, in a sense, it was all about restraint. They [the Chinese authorities] didn’t kill him … and it managed to play itself over the top of all the pictures of dead bodies.""  Later, as the collective memory of the massacre faded, it became more expedient to airbrush it out of history. ""In the Western world, it's an iconic image of protest and the dangers of autocracy and the suppression of free speech,"" says Cooper. ""Whereas, within China, you don't see the image at all."" The Emmy award-winning In Event of Moon Disaster (2019), created by American new media artist Halsey Burgund and British digital artist Francesca Panetta, is also on show at the Sainsbury Centre. The film, shown on a vintage TV as part of an immersive installation of a 1960s living room, plays on the many conspiracy theories surrounding the first Moon landing by presenting an alternative version of reality and asking if viewers can spot a deepfake. Some elements are real – the script prepared in case the astronauts on Nasa's Apollo 11 mission in 1969 died, for example – while others, such as the deepfake of President Richard Nixon reading out the script created by synthesising an actor's voice using AI, are not. ""All of the footage we used was real archival footage from Apollo 11,"" the quiz explains at the end. ""However, we used techniques of misinformation to tell a story vastly different from what actually happened."" ""The effect that scares me most is not that we'll be fooled by fake photos but that we'll ignore the real ones, or choose which to believe based on our presumptions,"" Athens-based photographer Maria Mavropoulou tells the BBC. In 2023, interested in how new image-making tools may shift our perception of reality, she used the prompt ""A Self-Portrait of an Algorithm"" to invite AI to introduce itself. The portraits that emerged, some of which are currently on show in Photography through the lens of AI at Amsterdam's Foam Museum, were different every time she asked. AI's identity was shifting − the truth of what it really was, intangible. ""It seems to me that truth is an idea that is sometimes too difficult to pin down and that it is not to be found on the surface of an image,"" she says. For years, Mavropoulou's own portrait was rarely taken, her itinerant childhood leaving much of her early life undocumented. In Imagined Images (2023), she used what she knew about her family history as prompts for text-to-image software and created the family photo album she never had. At first, the photographs seem unremarkable, but looking closely at A five-year-old girl blowing out birthday candles, we see that the children's faces are distorted, a bowl floats off the tablecloth and ""party food"" has become a hybrid of cake and chips. The album's images are made up of what she calls ""statistical truths"" based on typologies, such as ""mother"", ""party"" and ""holiday"", synthesised from a multitude of data sources. Yet though real photo albums have ""no clear intention to lie or deceive"", the story they tell is also unreliable, says Mavropoulou. ""Only happy moments, celebrations and milestones make it in the album, while difficulties, struggles, and loss are left unphotographed."" The in-built biases in AI are also the subject of Where Am I From (Ana Min Wein?) (2022), a short film and visual diary created by New York-based visual artist Nouf Aljowaysir. The work forms part of the Saudi-born artist's exploration into a genealogical journey led by two narrators: the artist and AI. ""Through my mother's beautiful story, I felt belonging,"" she tells the BBC. ""However, as I processed these images through computer vision techniques, this revealed failures in the form of generalisations and stereotypes, uncovering systemically embedded prejudice within commercial AI tools."" Desert scenes were interpreted as military operations, for example, and AI cannot decide if a hijab is ""a poncho"", a ""costume"" or a ""tent"". There's an element of comedy and surprise, but the overall effect is unsettling. ""The film shows how artificial intelligence sees my culture through a simplistic and biased Western lens, reducing my identity, culture and erasing collective ancestral memories,"" she says. BBC Verify With misinformation on the rise, the BBC has launched a brand aimed at countering fake news. BBC Verify is dedicated to examining the facts and claims behind a story to try to determine whether or not it is true, bringing together journalists with a range of forensic investigative skills and open-source intelligence (Osint) capabilities. As well as fact-checking, verifying video, countering disinformation and analysing data, the team transparently shares their evidence-gathering with the audience, explaining complex stories in the pursuit of truth. Reclamation of the Exposition (2020), by British-Nigerian visual artist Tayo Adekunle, exposes the colonial lens behind the 19th-Century ""truth"" about the black female body expressed in the archival images of Prince Roland Napoleon Bonaparte. ""The Bonaparte images were actually taken in the botanical gardens in Paris, and these were South African women who were brought over and put on animal skin [made to pose standing on it] to replicate an exotic environment,"" Adekunle tells the BBC. These staging elements also included removing the women's clothes. Their images became curios for what she describes as ""pseudo-science"" and were distributed as pornographic postcards. ""They perpetuated the idea that black women were more sexual and that people from Africa were savages because they didn't wear clothes,"" says Adekunle. Her decision to place herself in the image and mimic their pose is a gesture of solidarity and a symbol of the timelessness of these mistruths. ""There's a power struggle that happens when you have a photographer and a sitter, and even more so, when that photographer is a white man and the sitter is a black woman,"" she says. ""I didn't want the images, this legacy in the relationship, to feel like it was only existing in the past."" More like this: • How the American Dream came to represent both a utopia and a dystopia • The early Soviet images that foreshadowed fake news • Drowning World: Striking photos of the climate crisis While misrepresentation, as in the case of Bonaparte, can be disturbing, deception is something different in the work of British photographer Alison Jackson more than a century later. In her solo show at the Vrijthof, Royal Selfie appears to show Elizabeth II taking a family snap, while Trump and Money features an open-shirted Donald Trump lookalike with his arms around two women, and is one of several images in the show that play with public perceptions of the US presidential candidate. Such realistic images – placing famous lookalikes in amusing or compromising situations – are a reminder, says the museum, ""that we cannot trust our own eyes when it comes to photography"". Even the best-known faces in the world can fool us. ""The truth is dead,"" Jackson says. ""Nothing we are shown can be trusted; everything can be faked and nothing is authentic."" Jackson's work was initially inspired by the mourning of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales by a public that had never met her, which she felt exposed a tension between perception and reality. Speaking to Euronews in 2020, she said: ""We've got mistaken over what is real and what is not and that is what interests me… We're prepared to go along with a bunch of media narratives – we're all so surface."" In Event of Moon Disaster and The Camera Never Lies: Challenging images through The Incite Project are at the Sainsbury Centre, Norwich until 4 August and 20 October respectively.

306,Extravagant wedding of India tycoon Ambani’s son in full swing,"After months of lavish celebrations, the wedding ceremony of the son of Asia's richest man is finally under way in the Indian city of Mumbai.   Anant Ambani, son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, is tying the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant. The four-day extravaganza is the final stop in a string of elaborate parties the family has hosted since March, which have featured performances by popstars including Rihanna and Justin Bieber.  Reality TV star Kim Kardashian, and former UK PMs Tony Blair and Boris Johnson, were among the international guests. Also spotted was US wrestler and actor John Cena, who was seen hugging and congratulating relatives of the host. Key roads in Mumbai are being sealed off for several hours a day until the festivities end on Monday. Social media is awash with updates on the wedding, with people sharing minute-by-minute details of Bollywood stars and celebrities arriving. But the extraordinary opulence has also led to backlash - city dwellers have complained the road closures have worsened traffic snarls caused by monsoon flooding, while others have questioned the ostentatious display of wealth at the seemingly never-ending celebrations.  Mukesh Ambani, 66, is at present the world's 10th richest man with a net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes. Reliance Industries, founded by his father in 1966, is a massive conglomerate that operates in sectors ranging from petroleum and retail, to financial services and telecoms. Anant Ambani is the youngest of his three children, all of whom are on the board of Reliance Industries. The 29-year-old is involved in Reliance's energy businesses and is on the board of Reliance Foundation. The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them but wedding planners estimate they've already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m]. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Justin Bieber is $10m. One unnamed executive at Reliance claimed the event was a ""powerful symbol of India's growing stature on the global stage"" in a note shared with reporters. But opposition politician Thomas Isaac said it was ""obscene"". ""Legally it may be their money but such ostentatious expenditure is a sin against mother earth and (the) poor,"" he posted on X. On Friday, the groom set off from his residence in a luxurious red car covered in strings of white flowers, as joyful guests danced around it.  A convoy of cars, also decorated with flowers and carrying family members, followed him with music and cheers.  The grand procession, known as the baraat, culminated at the wedding venue - a  convention centre owned by the Ambanis - where several Bollywood stars joined in another round of singing and dancing. Reports say the bride and groom will exchange garlands to kick off the wedding. The pheras - the main wedding ritual of the couple walking around the sacred fire seven times - is set for 21:30 (1600GMT).  Guests will reportedly bless the newly-weds in a formal ceremony on Saturday - followed by a grand party where unconfirmed reports say pop stars Drake, Lana Del Ray and Adele are likely to perform.  Pictures and videos of Kim Kardashian, who is in the city with her sister Khloé Kardashian, are being widely shared online.  Reports say the sisters have brought a team of stylists, including celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton, along with a group of producers to capture every detail of their trip.   Former Indian president Ram Nath Kovind, British High Commissioner to India Lindy Cameron, and US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti are also in the city to attend the wedding. Rajan Mehra, CEO of air charter company Club One Air, told Reuters that the family had rented three Falcon-2000 jets to ferry wedding guests to the event. “The guests are coming from all over and each aircraft will make multiple trips across the country,” he said.  The wedding festivities began in March when the family held a three-day pre-wedding party in their home state of Gujarat. Among the 1,200 guests to attend that celebration were Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates.  The party started with a performance by Rihanna on the first night. Diljit Dosanjh, the first Punjabi singer to perform at Coachella, took the stage on the second night, while rapper Akon closed the show on the final day of celebrations.  In June, the Ambanis organised another pre-wedding celebration, this time, a luxury cruise from Italy to France. The Backstreet Boys, Katy Perry and Pitbull performed for the 800 guests, which included Bollywood stars and cricketers. Money was also lavished on constructing 14 temples inside a sprawling complex in Jamnagar to showcase India's cultural heritage and provide a backdrop for the wedding. As part of the celebrations, the Ambanis hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples. On Wednesday, the family hosted a bhandara - a community feast for underprivileged people.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x22w0xl0o,"Zoya Mateen & Meryl Sebastian,",2024-07-12 19:09:07,
301,Poland considers downing Russian missiles over Ukraine,"Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has said Warsaw is considering a proposal from Kyiv to shoot down Russian missiles heading towards Polish territory while they are still in Ukrainian airspace. The proposal was included in a joint defence agreement between the two countries signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Warsaw earlier this week. ""At this stage, this is an idea. What our agreement said is we will explore this idea,” Mr Sikorski told the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. He said some Russian missiles fired from the St Petersburg area towards Ukrainian targets near the western city of Lviv, not far from the Polish border, traversed Belarus and entered Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before turning towards their targets in Ukraine. Mr Sikorski acknowledged that such a short time gave Poland little time to react. However the proposal would theoretically cover any missile traversing western Ukraine in the direction of Poland. “We are a frontline state and Russian missiles breach our airspace. We assume by mistake,"" Mr Sikorski said. “Our dilemma is the following. If we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property.  ""And the Ukrainians are saying, ‘Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they’re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory.  ""To my mind, that’s self-defence but we are exploring the idea,” Mr Sikorski said. Mr Sikorski said an unarmed Russian missile landed near his home in Bydgoszcz about 500km (311 miles) from the Belarusian border, without harming anyone, in December 2022. Two Polish citizens had been killed by falling debris when Ukraine shot down a Russian missile near the Polish border a month earlier. Earlier this week, Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would consult with its Nato allies and seek their agreement before attempting to shoot down any Russian missiles. “If there would be such a decision, it can only be an allied decision. It will never be an individual decision,” Mr Kosiniak-Kamysz told Poland's TVN broadcaster at a Nato summit in Washington DC.  ""The key opinion is the United States, who is quite sceptical in this matter, so Poland will certainly not make such a decision on its own,” he added. Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polityka Insight, told the BBC the idea could prove perilous for Poland. “Without robust allied support, which there isn’t, this proposal is very risky,"" he said. ""From the point of view of our air defence assets and the fact we might be subject to some kind of Russian response.” Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Poland has provided Ukraine with 44 packages of weapons and ammunition, including more than 250 tanks, MiG-29 fighter jets, combat helicopters, artillery systems and portable air defence missile systems worth more than €4bn ($4.4bn; £3.4bn). Poland plans to provide additional military assistance to Ukraine this year.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09234xxn1o,"Adam Easton,",2024-07-12 17:09:07,
304,Eminem's The Death of Slim Shady 'a mixed bag',"Guess who's back, back again?  Eminem's latest album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), has been released and is being met with mixed reviews by critics.  In the US rapper's 12th album, his alter ego Slim Shady is killed off - the artwork shows Shady in a body bag, and in the music video for Tobey, Eminem takes a chainsaw to him. Clash called the album ""a mixed bag"" and described it as ""at once an effective piece of fan service, while also being a record that disappoints"". ""It doesn’t quite feel like an ending, but neither does it feel like a continuation,"" Robin Murray wrote. ""A mixed, often muddled album, it features some of Eminem’s best rapping in a decade – those fast, skippy-yet-intricate flows will never fail to thrill – but his pen is often blunted."" Ahead of the release, Eminem told fans this is a ""conceptual album"" and the songs should be listened to in order.  The 19 tracks include previously released singles Tobey and Houdini, as well as a sequel to his 1999 hit Guilty Conscience with Dr Dre.  Billboard ranked the latter song as one of the best on the new album and said ""it’s not the original, but is a worthy second coming"". ""At one point, Slim Shady puts Marshall on blast for creating him as an alter-ego to stir up controversy and essentially be a shield to say jarring things that he didn’t really have the courage to stand on,"" Michael Saponara wrote. USA Today said the 51-year-old is a ""lyrical pugilist throughout, except when he turns misty-eyed dad rapping about daughter Hailie Jade"".  His song Temporary starts with old recordings of the rapper and his daughter talking as a child.  Melissa Ruggieri said it was the most memorable song on the album ""because it gives Eminem permission to drop the shtick and explore his vulnerability – which isn’t often apparent elsewhere on the album"". Eminem calls on his 28-year-old daughter to ""be strong"" and that he will always be her rock. On his track Fuel, Eminem references the multiple sexual assault allegations against fellow rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. ""I'm like an R-A-P-E-R/I got so many S-As/S-As/Wait, he didn't just spell the word rapper and leave out a 'P', did he?"" the lyrics say. Pitchfork said Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers III, ""reckons with his controversies while taking pains to create new one"".  The track Antichrist ""take pains to offend as crudely as possible"" with references to pronouns, woke society and ""the harrowing video of Diddy attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie in a hotel in 2016"". Mr Combs, one of rap's most successful moguls, apologised for his ""inexcusable"" actions shown in that video, and has denied all allegations of sexual assault. A review by the Independent gave the album two stars and said the rapper was ""punching downwards, joylessly and without inspiration"".  ""Much of The Death Of Slim Shady resembles a Telegraph op-ed: the ham-fisted mashing of people’s buttons, the blethering about 'the PC police' and 'Gen Z' coming to get him.

303,Children killed in Nigeria school collapse,"A number of children have died and more than 100 others are trapped after a school building collapsed in Nigeria’s central Plateau state, local officials say.  Saint Academy in the state capital Jos caved in while students were in class on Friday morning.  Trapped pupils  were calling for help from under the rubble, AFP reported, with parents frantically searching for their children. The National Emergency Management Agency  (Nema) said ""the exact number of deaths is still being confirmed"". Media reports say at least 17 students were killed. In a post on X, Nema said more than 40 trapped students were rescued and taken to local hospitals. Nigeria's Punch newspaper reported 17 dead while the AFP news agency quoted Red Cross spokesman Nuruddeen Hussain Magaji as saying 21 people were killed. The school is believed to have more than 1,000 pupils. Local resident, Abel Fuandai, told the BBC that his friend's son had been killed and said ""the scale of the tragedy is frightening"". He said rescue workers and emergency officials were racing to save those trapped and using excavators to dig through the rubble. The cause of the collapse is not known but residents said it came after three days of heavy rains in Plateau. Speaking from hospital, injured student Wulliya Ibrahim told AFP: ""I entered the class not more than five minutes, when I heard a sound, and the next thing is I found myself here. ""We are many in the class, we are writing our exams,"" he said. Resident Chika Obioha said he had seen a number of dead bodies and that dozens of people had been rescued. ""Everyone is helping out to see if we can rescue more people,"" he said. There have been several major building collapses in Nigeria in recent years, with observers blaming a mix of bad workmanship, poor quality materials and corruption. In 2021, at least 45 people were killed when a high-rise building under construction collapsed in a wealthy Lagos neighbourhood. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

302,US allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato - but is that even possible?,"Only one US president has been at the Nato summit in Washington this week, but the shadow of another - his predecessor - has loomed over this meeting of the world's most powerful military alliance. While the host Joe Biden has presided over a message of unity from the group's 32 members, the Nato-sceptic views of his rival for power, Donald Trump, have imbued conversations here with an urgency and an anxiety. At times the smiles from world leaders in the conference hall have felt fragile. Trump “hangs over every conversation here"", said one Eastern European diplomat who asked to remain nameless.  The Republican's election as president in November ""could change everything”, the diplomat said. The fact that Mr Biden has been trying to fend off a political crisis over his frailty has only sharpened the sense that a second Trump term could bring far-reaching changes to an alliance forged in the ashes of the World War Two and still reliant on hard US military power to deter adversaries. So does Nato need to “Trump-proof” itself - as some describe it -  and if so, is it possible?  There is a lot of evidence of efforts by Nato allies to reach out already to those in  Trump’s political orbit to try to manage relationships and limit what they would see as the potential damage of a second term. But others suggest something more unmanageable. Camille Grand, a French former official who was one of Nato’s deputy leaders throughout the Trump administration, described himself as “much more worried” than colleagues who think a second term may be “Trump [term] one on steroids” but ultimately workable for the alliance.  “He doesn't have the same sort of guardrails, he doesn't have the same sort of adults in the room. And he has around him a team that is trying to turn his instinct into policy,” said Mr Grand, who is now a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.  Four members of visiting delegations, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC their concern was not necessarily that a Trump administration would withdraw entirely from Nato, as he has threatened before. Rather it is a fear that the US commitment to the alliance's core principle of collective security - ""all for one and one for all"", meaning any ally under attack can expect defence from the others - could wane. Trump’s positions on Nato have veered erratically from outright hostility - portraying the alliance as a bunch of freeloading Europeans surviving off protection paid for by US taxpayers - to suggesting his outbursts are simply part of a cunning negotiating tactic to compel more of Nato’s members to meet its defence spending targets.  He has frequently tried to rally crowds of supporters with attacks on the organisation. As the summit began, he posted to his Truth Social network that when he started as president most Nato members were “delinquent” until they “paid up” due to his pressure.   By the end of Trump’s presidency, four more Nato countries had hit the alliance’s guidelines of spending at least 2% of national income on defence. So far during President Biden’s term, another 13 countries have reached the target. That progress is frequently touted by the Biden administration and its backers, although in reality much of the increase was triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to Nato countries that did not spend enough.  That sparked outrage from some quarters in Washington, but privately his threats are said to have gone further.  At a panel event in January,  European Union commissioner Thierry Breton  described a meeting he had attended in 2020 between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  “Donald Trump said to Ursula: ‘You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you. And by the way, Nato is dead. And we will leave, we will quit Nato.’  ""It was the president of the United States of America,” recalled Mr Breton. “He may come back.""    Trump’s campaign has been approached by the BBC with a request to confirm whether the account was accurate. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, believes there remains a real concern even over Nato’s existence under Mr Trump.  “I think there is a danger with Trump that he tries to pull us out of Nato. I won't sugarcoat that,” said Dr Farkas, now executive director at public policy think tank the McCain Institute.  “The reality is Trump is dangerous to the alliance in that America is still the strongest economic, political, military power and Nato is stronger if Nato has the United States inside the alliance."" But one of those familiar with the thinking in Trump’s political orbit, Dan Caldwell from the right-wing think tank Defence Priorities, believes the former president's priority is to push European nations to invest more in their own militaries.  “I don't think he wants to withdraw from Nato, but he has said that the United States should re-evaluate its role and the purpose of Nato going forward,” he said.  “Not only the former president but more and more national security experts on the right believe the United States has really no choice but to do less in Europe. So I think that there's some larger forces at play, that will eventually force the next president, regardless of who it is… to substantially pull back from Nato."" The most detailed account of policy positions that might influence a second Trump term comes from an initiative being brought up by supporters and detractors of Trump alike. Overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, “Project 2025” is a 900-page detailed blueprint for a Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.  The initiative says a future president should “transform Nato” so that America’s role is primarily for its nuclear deterrent, while other members should field “the great majority” of conventional forces required to deter Russia.  This is in keeping with the project’s foreign policy position, seeing the main threat to US primacy as China and therefore calling for the next president to “bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions” sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  Trump himself has equivocated over the war but has said he would end it in “24 hours”. He favours brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine on terms that many Nato allies would see as surrender for Kyiv.  Trump has partially disavowed Project 2025, saying he does not know who is behind it but many of his former officials had a hand in writing it, including a former acting defense secretary.  Since Trump left office, the increase in the number of Nato members spending at least 2% of their income on defence has better insulated the alliance for the future, said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Asked about ""Trump-proofing"", he said Congress had also moved to shield America's membership of Nato from the whims of the White House, in a law passed last year. “We clarified no president can unilaterally withdraw from Nato without a vote of approval from the Senate,” Mr Coons told the BBC.  He also highlighted the $60bn military assistance package for Ukraine finally passed in April in a bipartisan effort following nine months of paralysis, after allies of Trump blocked passage of the bill through Congress.  ""It is my hope that we will continue to be a counterweight and a counterbalance to the president should we, I think, make the tragic mistake of moving forward with a second Trump term.” But Trump has repeatedly challenged current levels of US military provision for Ukraine, again arguing he could negotiate the war’s end with Russia.  Another possible attempt to future-proof US support for Ukraine is by moving more co-ordination for arms supply to Nato itself - taking it further out of reach of a future American president. Such a move has been pitched by Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as a way to ""shield"" Ukraine's supply of aid “against the winds of political change"", officials told The Financial Times.  At the summit the alliance agreed to launch a new program in which Nato will supplement, but not replace, a 50-nation “contact group” that co-ordinates delivery of weapons. Camille Grand, the former Nato official, thinks the summit may have “raised the cost” for a future President Trump to roll back the ""messaging” from Nato, but in the end, he said, Trump-proofing was impossible.  “If the US, as the biggest shareholder in the alliance, decides to be tough on the alliance, on Ukraine, there is no nothing in the [summit agreement] and previous summits that prevent it from doing that.  “But I think it's sending an important message to Trump and his team, which is that the Europeans have turned the corner when it comes to [increased] spending.” Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský reiterated that, telling me that any future president of the US that wanted to change things on Nato had the power to do so.  The real work of “Trump-proofing” at this summit has instead felt like Nato supporters pitching the alliance to conservative Americans to try to change their view. This found its most striking moment when President Zelensky appeared at the Reagan Institute for an on-stage conversation with Fox News host Bret Baier.  Mr Zelensky repeatedly raised the memory of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan, quoting Cold War lines on deterring enemies through working with allies.   Reagan is a favoured reference for Democrats trying to expose Republican divisions and what they see as the maverick isolationism of Trump. The subtext is: Reagan would turn in his grave at Trump’s Nato-sceptic stance. But it's a message that may fall flat with those who Mr Zelensky thinks need to hear it.

300,German shock at reported Russian assassination plot,"German political figures have reacted angrily to a report that Russia had plotted to kill the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall, Armin Papperger. The CNN report said US officials had told their counterparts in Berlin earlier this year and security around him was stepped up. Germany's interior ministry refused to comment but Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock appeared to confirm the details. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months,"" she told reporters at the Nato summit in Washington. ""Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression."" In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations. ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously."" Rheinmetall avoided commenting on issues of ""corporate security"", but Mr Papperger is now being described as the most highly protected figure in Germany's economy. He told the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"". The company is one of the world's biggest producers of ammunition and has become key to supplying Ukraine with arms, armoured vehicles and other military equipment. Rheinmetall recently opened a tank repair plant in western Ukraine. Last month, it signed an agreement with Ukraine to expand co-operation in the coming years, including a joint venture to produce artillery shells. Mr Papperger said at the time his company wanted to hand over the first Lynx infantry fighting vehicles later this year and to start producing them in Ukraine soon. Although Chancellor Olaf Scholz avoided commenting on the reported assassination plot directly, he said it was well known that Germany was exposed to a variety of Russian threats and was paying close attention to them. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said ""we are taking very seriously the significantly heightened threat of Russian aggression"". Earlier this week, a senior Nato official told the BBC that Russia was ""engaging in aggressive covert operations across Europe – involving sabotage, arson and assassination plots – aimed at weakening public support for Ukraine"". The German foreign minister said the Baltic states had already highlighted the various methods deployed by Russia's Vladimir Putin in his war on Ukraine. As well as sabotage, she spoke of cyberattacks and disrupting GPS signals so that Baltic flights could no longer land in neighbouring countries. ""We have seen that there have been attacks on factories, and that again underlines that, together, we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,"" Ms Baerbock told reporters. In early May, a building complex owned by the Diehl Metall firm went up in flames in south-west Berlin. Although a technical fault was blamed for the fire, sabotage has not been ruled out. Suspicious fires have also been reported in Poland and Lithuania. Last April, Mr Papperger's garden house was set alight at Hermannsburg in northern Germany, although there has been no evidence of a Russian link. The fire was quickly brought under control and a rambling, anonymous confession purportedly from leftist militants appeared on activist network Indymedia.  The reported plot against such a high-profile German CEO has prompted widespread alarm. Leading conservative figure Roderich Kiesewetter said the chancellor should come clean with the German population about how great the threat from Russia really was. German intelligence needed to be boosted to the level of neighbouring countries, he said. ""We must take it very seriously and also prepare ourselves accordingly,"" he told public broadcaster ZDF. Michael Roth, who chairs Germany's foreign affairs committee told Bild newspaper that Vladimir Putin was waging a ""war of extermination not only against Ukraine, but against its supporters and our values"".  The head of the defence committee, Marcus Faber, added his condemnation, saying if information about Russian intelligence involvement came to light, then ""the expulsion of diplomats must follow and, if necessary, international arrest warrants must be issued"".",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wej84e9l7o,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-12 12:09:07,

Anant Ambani is tying the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of Indian pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant, in a traditional Hindu ceremony in Mumbai city on Friday. The wedding events began with parties and celebrations in March, before the family invited over 800 guests to join them on a cruise around Europe.  But Friday saw the arrival of some of the world's most recognisable faces, as politics, power and celebrity mixed on the red carpet.  Among those who crossed the globe for the events were several prominent political leaders. Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - accompanied by his wife Carrie  - was seen dancing as he entered the venue with one of his young children.  His predecessor, Tony Blair, was also in attendance. He was joined by his wife Cherie. The pair sported traditional Indian attire and arrived just days after Mr Blair's Labour Party returned to power in the UK.  Reality TV star Kim Kardashian documented her arrival on Instagram, travelling with her sister Khloe. She hinted that their journey to the ceremony would be featured in the upcoming season of the Kardashians.  Sporting stars were also in attendance. Indian cricket legend MS Dhoni was accompanied by his family, while Fifa President Gianni Infantino was spotted hitting the red carpet with his wife Leena Al Ashqar. WWE legend John Cena followed soon after, cracking jokes with photographers as he entered the venue.  Bollywood's leading lights also dazzled. Priyanka Chopra arrived in Mumbai with her husband, singer Nick Jonas. The pair were seen grooving on the dance floor, according to Indian media.  Kriti Sanon walked the red carpet in a pink lehenga, while Ananya Panday - who is a bridesmaid - appeared in a tiger-print yellow lehenga embroidered with ""Anant's Brigade"" on the back. The couple's wedding celebrations are likely to continue over several days. Parties have been reportedly planned for Saturday and Sunday and a grand reception is scheduled for Monday.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng8z8mj12o,Unknown,2024-07-12 22:36:07,
305,Alec Baldwin's Rust trial dismissed amid claims of hidden evidence,"Alec Baldwin broke into tears as a New Mexico judge dismissed manslaughter charges over the shooting death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of his film Rust. The dismissal came three days into Baldwin's trial in Santa Fe, at a court just miles from the Western film set where Ms Hutchins, a cinematographer, was shot with a revolver Mr Baldwin was using in rehearsals.  His lawyers alleged police hid evidence of the source of the live round that killed her. It is the second time the case against the actor has been dismissed since the October 2021 shooting.  A key aspect of the case has been how live ammunition ended up on the film set and Mr Baldwin’s lawyers have questioned the investigation and mistakes made by authorities who processed the scene. The motion set off a remarkable set of events with one of the two special prosecutors leading the case resigning, and Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissing the jury so she could hear from multiple witnesses.  The bullets, Mr Baldwin's lawyer said, could be related to Hutchins' death but were filed in a different case with a different number.  Prosecutors argued the ammunition was not connected to the case and did not match bullets found on the Rust set. Mr Baldwin broke into tears as the judge read from a lengthy statement detailing her reasons for the dismissal. His wife, Hilaria, covered his mouth. Other members of his family cried and smiled. Judge Sommer said that even if this evidence was not critical or relevant to the case, it is required that it should have been given to the defence. ""The state's wilful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,"" she said from the bench. ""There is no way for the court to right this wrong."" The evidence came to light on Thursday, when a crime-scene technician said in evidence that a man named Troy Teske, a retired police officer, had turned over live ammunition that could be related to the case.  Mr Teske is friends with the step-father of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year.  He was working with Seth Kenney, who helped with props on the film set.  In 2023, prosecutors in the case dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Mr Baldwin, saying they had new evidence and needed more time to investigate. They refiled that charge in January. This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly. Please refresh the page for the fullest version.

312,The three-way international tussle for Euro 24 star Lamine Yamal,"The teenage sensation has shone at the Euros Lamine Yamal's peformance at the ongoing European Championships is set to boost football in Equatorial Guinea, says the country’s football federation. The 16-year-old, who has stunned the world with his displays in Germany, plays for Spain despite having an Equatoguinean mother and a Moroccan father. He was born in Barcelona, where he grew up and is coming through La Masia academy for the five-time European champions, with whom he recently concluded his first season of action. ""Even though Lamine is not playing for Equatorial Guinea, we hold him very close in our hearts and think he is going to do many things for Equatoguinean football,"" Venancio Tomas Ndong Micha, the country’s football federation president, told BBC Sport Africa. ""We are enjoying his extraordinary performances at the Euros, on top of the great season with FC Barcelona. ""He has our roots, and this shows that we are a country of good footballers,"" added Ndong Micha. Entrusted with dead-ball situations for a major European football nation despite his tender age, Yamal has shown his all-around ability with his stunning goal against France and assists in the games against Croatia, Georgia and Germany. He is set to play the final against England on Sunday, a day after he turns 17, making him the youngest player to contest a final at either the Euros or World Cup. Pele is the youngest to play in a World Cup Final. He was 17 years 249 days when he played in Brazil's 5-2 triumph over Sweden in the 1958  final, when he scored twice. Yamal's record as the youngest goal scorer at a Euros (aged 16 years 361 days) will be very hard to beat. As will his feats at Barcelona – for whom he is the youngest player to start a league game (16 years and 38 days) – and in La Liga, where he is the youngest scorer in history (16 years and 87 days).  Equatorial Guinea is a country split into two parts, with the capital Malabo located on one of its island areas while the largest city on its African mainland section is Bata, where Yamal’s mother was born. She eventually found her way to Spain where she was working as a waitress when she met his father, from whom she has since separated. While his mother and grandmother live in Barcelona, the rest of Yamal’s maternal family are still in Equatorial Guinea, a country which has reached the knock-out stages at the last two Africa Cup of Nations despite its small stature. Three years ago, Equatorial Guinea’s football federation (Feguifoot) tried to secure the winger’s services for the team currently ranked 89th by Fifa, only to discover they were far behind Spain, who play England in Sunday’s European Championship final. ""We contacted the family in 2021 but the advances with the Spanish football federation had gone very deep,"" Ndong Micha explained. ""But we did try, because I am a good friend of the family by chance – particularly the grandfather – and all the family used to talk about the kid. ""Then, there were also the Moroccans who went after him... but the Spanish beat us."" Faouzi Lekjaa, the president of Morocco’s football federation, has explained how their attempts to secure Yamal last year ended in defeat, given the teenager's firm desire to play for Spain. Nonetheless, both African countries remain close to Yamal’s heart – as can be seen by the presence of their respective national flags on the football boots his feet dazzle in. “This shows that even though he is playing for Spain, he is not forgetting his Equatoguinean roots,” added Ndong Micha. His boots nod to his parents' home countries - Morocco and Equatorial Guinea Ndong Micha believes that Yamal is placing his mother’s nation firmly in the global spotlight, saying it echoes Ansu Fati’s breakthrough at an early age, also at Barcelona, when people learnt about his family’s country Guinea-Bissau. ""His performances – coupled with those in the Barca first team – show that Equatorial Guinea has an extraordinarily different way of playing to most African countries,"" argues Ndong Micha. ""Given his talent, and his roots, we could one day have more players like Lamine here."" Yamal is not the first Spain-based player with Equatoguinean roots to hit the headlines this year, after Emilio Nsue stunned global observers when finishing top scorer at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations aged 34. Far less welcome global headlines followed last month, when Fifa ruled that the striker had never been declared eligible to play for Equatorial Guinea, for whom he is top scorer with 22 goals. Nonetheless, his goals helped the ""National Thunder"" reach the final 16. The nation of under two million people has reached the knock-out phase at all four Afcons they have contested. ""We have to continue preparing well,"" says Ndong Micha. ""The government will soon invest in football academies so that we can unearth more Lamines and Emilios in future. It is prepared to keep investing as it has in recent years to continue searching for natural talent from Equatorial Guinea, but particularly in the country itself. ""Prior to my arrival, we had never qualified for a Nations Cup on our own merits – only as a host nation (twice) – but we have now qualified twice for Afcon outright (in 2021 and 2023). ""On a sporting level, with Fifa, the Confederation of African Football, and our government we are going to keep growing football-wise so that in the next few years, Equatorial Guinea will be the model of a small country but a big giant-killer.” If Ndong Micha gets his way and the tiny central African nation secures a historic first World Cup qualification, there is even a chance that Yamal could face his mother’s nation on the biggest stage one day. Equatorial Guinea may be small but it punches well above its weight in football",2024-07-12 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn07d8g16xno,Piers Edwards,2024-07-12 23:09:08,

314,Australian soldier charged with spying for Russia,"An Australian soldier and her husband have been arrested and each charged with spying for Russia. Investigators say the couple - both Russian-born Australian citizens - obtained Australian Defence Force (ADF) material to share with Moscow. However, Australian police say ""no significant compromise"" of military secrets has been identified. It is the first time stricter foreign interference laws - introduced by Australia in 2018 - have been used to lay espionage charges. Kira Korolev, a 40-year-old army private, and her 62-year-old husband Igor Korolev faced court in Brisbane on Friday, each on one count of preparing for an espionage offence – which carries a maximum 15-year jail sentence. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been ""briefed extensively"" by the nation's security agencies but would not comment on the case directly as it is now before the courts. Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the couple had been in Australia for more than a decade before the alleged offending and had both become citizens several years ago. Igor worked as a self-employed labourer, and Kira was an information systems technician in the army, a role for which she had obtained a security clearance, police say. Mr Kershaw alleged she secretly travelled to Russia while on leave from the ADF, then instructed Igor to access her work account and send sensitive material so that she could forward it on to Russian authorities. An investigation in to whether any of the material was ever delivered to them is still underway, Mr Kershaw said, adding that the charges could be upgraded. Both Mr Kershaw and Australia's spy agency boss Mike Burgess – who addressed media together on Friday - declined to answer questions about the nature of the documents or how authorities were tipped off about the alleged crimes. But Mr Burgess said that the ongoing threat of espionage is ""real"". ""Multiple countries are seeking to steal Australia's secrets. We cannot be naive, and we cannot be complacent."" ""If you are spying in this country, we are looking for you. If you are being spied on in this country, we are looking out for you,"" he added. Mr Kershaw stressed that Australia's allies could be ""confident"" that the country would ""continue to identify and disrupt espionage and foreign interference activity"". In a statement, the ADF said it was aware one of its members had been arrested and that it ""takes all breaches of security seriously"".",2024-07-12 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yl3pvl1xo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-12 04:09:08,
315,Kenya's police chief resigns after deadly anti-tax protests,"Kenya's police chief Japhet Koome has resigned, following weeks of violent protests against proposed tax hikes in which more than 40 people died. Human rights groups have accused police of shooting dozens of protestors, some of them fatally, and abducting or arbitrarily arresting hundreds more. The resignation comes a day after President William Ruto sacked most of his cabinet, following pressure from the protest movement which is largely coordinated online by young Kenyans. Two weeks ago protesters stormed parliament, shortly after legislators passed the controversial finance bill. Police responded by opening fire on demonstrators in the streets. President Ruto later withdrew the bill but that has failed to satisfy the demonstrators, who want him to step down and are planning more protests to demand further reforms. Deputy police chief Douglas Kanja takes over running the force with immediate effect, the Kenyan presidency has said. Mr Koome's resignation has been welcomed by Kenyans, yet police officers who caught on film firing at protesters remain at large. Last week during an unprecedented discussion on X, formerly Twitter, President Ruto promised Kenyans he would take action against those police officers once he received video evidence. It is not clear whether this has happened. On Friday at least 11 dead bodies, some of them dismembered, were found at a rubbish tip in the capital, Nairobi, after residents raised the alarm. It is not yet clear whether their deaths have any connection with the protests. In the midst of the biggest crisis of his two-year presidency, Mr Ruto earlier this week met opposition leader Raila Odinga and announced plans to form a 150-member dialogue panel to help find a solution to the country's problems. After sacking key cabinet members on Thursday including the attorney-general, the  president said he would now consult widely in order to set up a broad-based government. The proposed tax measures were intended to help ease the country's debt burden of over $80bn (£63bn). About 60% of Kenya’s collected revenues goes to servicing debt. But protesters have insisted the government should first cut spending, saying there was too much waste and corruption. In response to this demand, the presidency last week announced a number of austerity measures. Additional reporting by Natasha Booty Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

316,Titanic mission to map wreck in greatest-ever detail,"A team of imaging experts, scientists and historians set sail for the Titanic on Friday to gather the most detailed photographic record ever made of the wreck. The BBC had exclusive access to expedition members in the US city of Providence, Rhode Island, as they made preparations to leave port. They'll be using state of the art technology to scan every nook and cranny of the famous liner to gain new insights into its sinking. This is the first commercial mission to Titanic since last year's OceanGate tragedy. Five men died while trying to visit the lost ship in a novel submersible. A joint memorial service will be held at sea in the coming days for them and the 1,500 passengers and crew who went down with Titanic in 1912. The new expedition is being mounted by the US company that has sole salvage rights and which to date has brought up some 5,500 objects from the wreck. But this latest visit is purely a reconnaissance mission, says RMS Titanic Inc, based in Atlanta, Georgia. Two robotic vehicles will dive to the ocean bottom to capture millions of high-resolution photographs and to make a 3D model of all the debris. ""We want to see the wreck with a clarity and precision that's never before been achieved,"" explained co-expedition lead David Gallo. The logistics ship Dino Chouest is going to be the base for operations out in the North Atlantic. Weather permitting, it should spend 20 days above the wreck, which lies in 3,800m (12,500ft) of water. It will be a poignant few weeks for all involved. One of the five who died on the OceanGate sub was Frenchman Paul-Henri (""PH"") Nargeolet. He was the director of research at RMS Titanic Inc and was due to lead this expedition. A plaque will be laid on the seabed in his honour. ""It's tough but the thing about exploration is that there's an urge and a drive to keep going. And we're doing that because of that passion PH had for continuous exploration,"" explained friend and historian Rory Golden, who will be ""chief morale officer"" on Dino Chouest. There can be few people on Earth who don't know the story of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic and how it was holed by an iceberg, east of Canada, on the night of 15 April 1912. There are countless books, movies and documentaries about the event. But although the wreck site has been the target of repeated study since its discovery in 1985, there still isn't what could be described as a definitive map. And while the bow and stern sections of the broken ship are reasonably well understood, there are extensive areas of the surrounding debris field that have received only cursory inspection. Two six-tonne remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) intend to put that right. One will be fitted with an array of ultra-high-definition optical cameras and a special lighting system; the other will carry a sensor package that includes a lidar (laser) scanner. Together, they'll track back and forth across a 1.3km-by-0.97km section of seafloor. Evan Kovacs, who's in charge of the imaging programme, says his camera systems should produce millimetre resolution. ""If all of the weather gods, the computer gods, the ROV gods, the camera gods -  if all those gods align, we should be able to capture Titanic and the wreck site in as close to digital perfection as you can get. You would be able to quite literally count grains of sand,"" he told BBC News. There's huge anticipation for what the magnetometer aboard the sensor ROV might produce. This is a first for Titanic. The instrument will detect all the metals at the wreck site, even material that is buried out of sight in the sediment. ""It would be an absolute dream to determine what has happened with Titanic's bow below the seafloor,"" explained geophysics engineer Alison Proctor. ""Hopefully, we'll be able to deduce whether or not the bow was crushed when it hit the seabed, or if it might actually extend down well into the sediment intact."" The team wants to review the state of some well known objects in the debris field, such as the boilers that spilled out as the opulent steamliner broke in half. There's the desire, too, to locate items thought to have been sighted on previous visits. These include an electric candelabra, which in its day would have been a fascinating curio, as well as the possibility of a second Steinway grand piano. The musical instrument's wooden surround would have long since decayed away, but the cast iron plate, or frame, that held the strings should still be there, perhaps even some of the keys. ""For me, it's the passengers' possessions, especially their bags, that are of greatest interest,"" said Tomasina Ray, who curates the collection of Titanic artefacts held by the company. ""It's their belongings - if we are able to retrieve more in the future - that help flesh out their stories. For so many passengers, they are just names on a list, and it's a way to keep them meaningful."" This will be RMS Titanic Inc's ninth visit to the wreck site. The firm has attracted controversy in recent years with its stated desire to try to bring up part of the Marconi radio equipment that transmitted the distress calls on the night of the sinking. It won't happen on this expedition but if and when it does occur, it would mean extracting an object from inside the disintegrating ship. For many, Titanic is the gravesite to the 1,500 who died that night in 1912 and should not be touched, its interior especially. ""We get that and understand it,"" said company researcher James Penca. ""We dive to Titanic to learn as much as we can from her; and like you should with any archaeological site, we do it with the utmost respect. But to leave her alone, to just let her passengers and crew be lost to history - that would be the biggest tragedy of all.""

323,"Remember me as 'decent', says retiring Anderson","This video can not be played Anderson gets standing ovation after England win James Anderson said he would like to be remembered as a “decent” bowler after he ended his legendary England career with victory over West Indies. Anderson took one more wicket as England wrapped up an innings win on the third morning, to end with 704 and sit third on the all-time list of Test bowlers. In moving and celebratory scenes at Lord’s, Anderson was given a guard of honour by both teams at the beginning of the day, then later appeared on the England balcony as spectators were allowed onto the outfield. “The way I have loved the sport so much, I would love for there to be people out there that have taken up the game because they have watched me bowl,” said the 41-year-old. “That people have been entertained by watching me bowl and there are kids or grown-ups who have taken up the art of swing bowling because they have seen me bowl. That would make me so happy.” Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, is the most successful pace bowler in the history of the game, with only spinners Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne ahead of him on the all-time list. In a 21-year career he won 188 Test caps, more than any other England player, but said he retires without ever feeling like he was a “great” of the game. “You go so up and down,” he told Sky Sports. “Some series you feel amazing and some not quite on it and a batter gets the better of you. “Playing against Virat Kohli in the early days, you felt you could get him out every ball and then recently like you can’t get him out at all. You feel so inferior. “I have never felt great at any stage. I know that sounds strange. I have always thought ‘how can I get better for the next series?’. That has helped me play for such a long time.” This video can not be played England make short work of West Indies in Anderson's final Test Anderson said he wondered if his career was over during last summer’s Ashes series, when he only managed five wickets in four Tests. He survived to be part of the tour of India, when he became the first fast bowler to reach 700 wickets in the final Test, but is now retiring from international cricket after the England management told him they want to blood younger bowlers. And, despite being part of four Ashes series wins, Anderson said he did not “nail” cricket against Australia, whereas his long-term new-ball partner Stuart Broad often found his best against England’s oldest rivals. “Unlike Stuart I don’t feel like I ever rose to the occasion,” said Anderson. “There were times where maybe I was trying too hard.” Anderson will immediately move into England’s backroom staff, becoming a bowling mentor for the second Test at Trent Bridge next week. England captain Ben Stokes has said Anderson could be part of the coaching team for the Ashes tour of Australia in 2025-26. Anderson has said he is unlikely to play county cricket for Lancashire again this summer, but has not ruled out a return in 2025, when he will be nearly 43.

325,Djokovic sets up Alcaraz rematch in Wimbledon final,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2024: Djokovic beats Musetti in straight sets to make tenth Wimbledon final Novak Djokovic outclassed Italian underdog Lorenzo Musetti to reach the Wimbledon final and set up a showdown with reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in a repeat of last year's final. The 37-year-old impressed as he stayed on course for a record-equalling eighth men's singles title at Wimbledon with a 6-4 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 victory on Centre Court. Musetti, 22, had one chance to get the break back in the final set but sent a forehand into the net and crouched down with his head in his hands, knowing the end was near. Djokovic made sure his opponent did not get another opportunity.  Under pressure, Musetti sent a shot long before Djokovic walked to the net, knowing he had reached his 37th Grand Slam final and 10th at Wimbledon. The Serb then moved his racquet over his shoulder and imitated playing a violin, in a gesture aimed at his six-year-old daughter Tara, with television cameras showing her grinning along. Some fans, however, started booing, thinking Djokovic, who produced the same celebration following his win over Holger Rune in the last 16, was being disrespectful. Alcaraz beat Djokovic in last year's showpiece, winning 1-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 3-6 6-4 in a five-set epic, which lasted four hours 42 minutes and is regarded one of the best matches in the tournament's history. The pair meet again on Sunday in what could be another amazing chapter in Wimbledon folklore. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2024: Crowd boos as Djokovic performs violin celebration after win Asked about Spaniard Alcaraz, Djokovic said: ""He's a great example of a player that has an all-round balance, he has a great team around him, great values, a lot of charisma and carries himself superbly - that's one of the reasons why is so popular. ""He's one of the greatest 21-year-olds we've ever seen and we're going to see a lot of him in the future, no doubt. He's going to win many Grand Slams, but hopefully not in two days. He can do it when I retire."" Djokovic, 16 years older than Alcaraz, added: ""He already beat me here in a Wimbledon final in a five-set thriller so I don't expect anything less than a huge battle. ""He is as complete a player as they come, so it's going to take the best of my ability to beat him."" Novak Djokovic is trying to match Roger Federer's total of eight Wimbledon titles Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slam titles, but this one would surely be the most remarkable of them all. The Serb had to withdraw from May's French Open before his quarter-final after suffering a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. Djokovic underwent surgery in early June and his participation in this tournament was in doubt. Yet now he is one match away from not only equalling Roger Federer's tally of eight Wimbledon titles, but also surpassing Margaret Court's total of 24 Grand Slam championships. ""There was plenty of doubt,"" admitted Djokovic. ""I came into London eight days before the tournament started. I didn’t know [if I would play] and was keeping everything open until the day of the draw. ""I played a couple of practice sets with top players and that proved to me I was in a good enough state to not just be in Wimbledon, but to go deep into the tournament."" Djokovic was playing for the first time since Monday when he beat Denmark's Rune in the last 16, but then accused some of the fans of disrespecting him. Some supporters were chanting the Dane's name, but stretching the start of it, with Djokovic saying it was used as an opportunity to boo him. There had been fears the same thing might happen again, using Musetti's name. But the match was largely played amid a wonderful atmosphere with both players receiving plenty of support and applause when merited. There threatened to be a flashpoint in the third set when a point was challenged, with Djokovic unhappy, and a delay to the action led to boos from a few fans. But the situation was soon dealt with, before Djokovic glared at a spectator who called out when he was playing a shot shortly after he had failed to take a match point. Again, the tension quickly passed as the match was played to a conclusion. Musetti, who had won a five-set quarter-final against 13th seed Taylor Fritz, had produced his best run in a Slam and gave everything against Djokovic, who gained the first key break in the sixth game. Unlike against Rune, Djokovic largely did not get involved in the crowd, although Musetti gained an instant break in the second set - a leaping, spinning overhead smash also brought sporting applause from Djokovic. The same happened following a glorious cross-court Musetti winner, but once the Serb won the tie-break, there looked no way back for his opponent. So it proved, with Djokovic breaking early in the third set on his way to yet another final as Musetti was unable to follow in the footsteps of fellow Italian Jasmine Paolini, who plays Barbora Krejcikova in Saturday's women's final. ""Nole played a really incredible match,"" said Musetti. ""He showed he's in great shape - not only in tennis. His tennis fits very well on this surface, it was a joke at the end how he was returning.""

324,Sancho trains with Man Utd after Ten Hag meeting,"Jadon Sancho was a runner up in last season's Champions League final on loan with Borussia Dortmund Jadon Sancho has returned to training with Manchester United following a meeting with manager Erik ten Hag. The English winger, 24, fell out with Ten Hag last season and was forced to train away from the first team before rejoining former club Borussia Dortmund on loan in January. Sancho impressed at Dortmund and his future has been the subject of speculation this summer, but he returned to United on Wednesday for testing before training with his team-mates the following day. Meanwhile, veteran defender Jonny Evans has signed a new one-year deal with the club.  The 36-year-old Northern Irishman made 30 appearances for United last season after rejoining the club on a one-year deal from Leicester City. Simon Stone, chief football news reporter Club sources have confirmed a clear-the-air meeting took place between Ten Hag and Sancho earlier this week and both parties agreed to draw a line under their previous disagreement. It has not been established whether Ten Hag received the apology he demanded after Sancho posted an inflammatory message on social media in response to the United boss saying his training performances had not been good enough before a Premier League game at Arsenal in September. As recently the beginning of last month, United were adamant their intention was to sell Sancho, whether Ten Hag remained as manager or not. However, BBC Sport was told Sancho was resistant to that idea given he has a lucrative contract that runs to 2026. In addition, United were not certain of getting back the kind of transfer fee that would make economic sense, given they paid £73m for the England international in 2021. Sancho will not be involved in Monday's opening pre-season friendly with Rosenborg in Norway. However, sources say the 24-year-old will be available for the remainder of United's programme, which includes a trip to Edinburgh to play Rangers at Murrayfield on 20 July and a three-match tour of the United States. Man Utd close to £33.7m deal for striker Zirkzee Dutchman Van de Beek joins Girona from Man Utd  Evans, meanwhile, progressed through the club's academy to the senior side in his first spell before permanently moving to West Brom and then Leicester. He made a substitute appearance for Erik ten Hag's side in last season's FA Cup final victory over rivals Manchester City. ""I am delighted to have extended my contract at Manchester United for another season,"" said Evans. ""To play for this great club and feel the support from our incredible fans is always a privilege. ""Returning to the club last season was an honour; representing the team on the pitch alongside fantastic team-mates under an excellent manager. ""Winning the FA Cup together was an unforgettable experience; I know we can challenge for more trophies in the season ahead.""

326,Paolini faces Krejcikova in unexpected final showdown,"Barbora Krejcikova (right) beat Jasmine Paolini in the pair's only previous meeting in the first round of Australian Open qualifying in 2018  Wimbledon 2024: Women's singles final (14:00 BST) Coverage: Watch live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 13:15 BST, listen on Radio 5 Live and follow live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app. A new women's champion will be crowned at Wimbledon on Saturday when surprise finalists Jasmine Paolini and Barbora Krejcikova face each other in an intriguing encounter. Paolini is vying to become Italy's first Wimbledon singles champion, while her opponent is hoping to continue the Czech Republic's proud record in the championships. At 5ft 4in tall, Paolini would also be the shortest Grand Slam singles champion in the Open era, having never tasted victory in a main tour match on grass until this summer. Krejcikova had only won three matches in five months before the tournament after struggling with illness and injury. The two 28-year-olds have taken advantage of an open women's draw and are now one match away from lifting the famous Venus Rosewater Dish. Whoever wins on Saturday, it is also guaranteed there will be a first-time Wimbledon champion for the seventh year in a row. This video can not be played Paolini beats Vekic in semi-final thriller Paolini, the first Italian woman to reach a Wimbledon final in the Open era, had lost in the opening round at SW19 in each of her three previous appearances. But she has made up for lost time this fortnight and picked up new fans along the way with her athleticism and warm personality, even admitting after one match that she found time to do her nails before her semi-final. Too scared to admit ""winning Wimbledon was one of her dreams"" until this week, her remarkable run was kickstarted at the French Open six weeks ago.  Paolini went beyond the third round of a major for the first time and eventually made it all the way to the final, losing to world number one Iga Swiatek. At Wimbledon, the seventh seed has continued her fantastic form, storming to victory in her first three matches before her fourth round match against Madison Keys was ended abruptly by injury to the American. Paolini took just 58 minutes to breeze past Emma Navarro in the quarter-finals and followed that up with an astonishing, record-breaking semi-final win over Donna Vekic. Six-time singles champion Billie Jean King praised her shot-making afterwards, with 2021 champion Ash Barty remarking there is ""no ball she doesn't run or fight for"". 'Emotional, cruel, euphoric' - the incredible semi-final This video can not be played Barbora Krejcikova pays tribute to inspiration Jana Novotna after win World number 32 Krejcikova had a difficult season before Wimbledon and admitted to ""doubts inside"" before her team told her to ""keep going and fighting"". She is now aiming to follow in the footsteps of compatriot Marketa Vondrousova, who stunned Ons Jabeur in last year's final. Krejcikova is the fifth Czech player to reach a Wimbledon final in the Open era, with other singles champions at SW19 including two-time winner Petra Kvitova and Jana Novotna, who coached Krejcikova before she died of ovarian cancer in 2017. ""We have a huge tennis history in the Czech Republic at Wimbledon,"" said Krejcikova.  ""When I was growing up, I had a lot of players that I could look up to."" She has the experience of playing in and winning a Grand Slam singles final, having triumphed at the 2021 French Open. She has also completed the career Slam in doubles, and has an Olympic doubles title to boot. Will that give her the advantage on Saturday - or will Paolini's never-give-up approach prove to be the difference? 'I miss her so much' - Krejcikova remembers Novotna Krejcikova, who won the French Open three years ago, reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January but was soon hampered with back problems and illnesses. She only played nine matches between the Australian Open and Wimbledon, winning three, with two of those victories coming in Birmingham in June. But at Wimbledon she has excelled, beating 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round, former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, and recovering from a set down to beat favourite Rybakina in the last four. Krejcikova can also take heart from the two women's doubles titles at Wimbledon she lifted with Katerina Siniakova in 2018 and 2022. And, always the doubles specialist, she still likes to approach the net to finish off points quickly - a stark contrast to Paolini who controls lengthy rallies from the baseline. Henry Patten has won two tournaments on tour, both with Harri Heliovaara who he started partnering this year. The men's doubles final, which features Briton Henry Patten, follows the women's final on Centre Court. Eight years ago, the 28-year-old was working courtside at Wimbledon as a statistician. Now Patten is a match away from his first Grand Slam title, having never previously gone beyond the third round of a major. ""Every single year I would watch Wimbledon and it's surreal for me given my pathway,"" he said. ""I think we have to remind ourselves how well we've done to get here."" Patten and Finland's Harri Heliovaara - who only teamed up in April and upset British 2023 champion Neal Skupski and New Zealand's Michael Venus in the last four - face Australian duo Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson in the final. Meanwhile, Andy Lapthorne will play in the quad wheelchair doubles final alongside Israel's Guy Sasson. They face Dutch duo and top seeds Sam Schroder and Niels Vink.

320,French rugby players charged with raping woman in Argentina,"Two French international rugby players have been charged with the aggravated rape of a woman following a match in Argentina, prosecutors in the South American country say.  Hugo Auradou, 20, and Oscar Jegou, 21, are accused of raping a 39-year-old woman after France beat Argentina on Saturday.  She alleges that they raped her multiple times and beat her in a hotel room in the city of Mendoza.  The pair, who chose ""not to testify"" at a hearing in the city, say they had consensual sex with the woman and deny rape. They will remain in custody while authorities investigate further.  Warning: this story contains details that some readers may find upsetting The woman alleged the attack took place at the Diplomatic Hotel, where France's players and staff were staying as part of a tour of South America.  Her lawyer says she left a nightclub with one of the men and accompanied him to the hotel room, where she alleges that she was raped ""at least six times"" by one of the men and once by the other.  Ms Romano told AFP that her client suffered ""fierce"" violence, with injuries to her face, back, breasts, legs and ribs as well as various bite and scratch marks. The woman was held against her will for several hours and tried to escape several times, Ms Romano said. Her client went to hospital on Thursday after feeling ill emotionally and physically because of the incident and is receiving treatment at a health facility, she added. On Friday a lawyer for the players said his clients were confident in their version of events. ""They are well and sure of their version, they are calm because they know they are innocent, but of course they are worried about this whole situation that they have had to live through,"" German Hnatow told reporters. On Wednesday another lawyer said the ""sexual relations"" had been consensual.  ""There are witnesses who saw her leave [the hotel]. There are cameras that saw her leave.  Apparently no injuries are seen in the footage,"" Mariano Cuneo Libarona told journalists.  French Rugby Federation (FFR) president Florian Gill, who is in Argentina, also told AFP that the players had ""quite a different version of events"".  ""We are not judges. We are not investigators. But we think that the Argentine justice system should look at the case very quickly,"" he said.

319,RFK Jr texts apology to sexual assault accuser - reports,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has apologised to a former family babysitter who accused him of sexual assault, US media report. Mr Kennedy reportedly texted his apology to Eliza Cooney, shortly after her allegations were published in Vanity Fair magazine.  Ms Cooney accused the former environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist of groping her on several occasions in the late 1990s. “I have no memory of this incident but I apologize sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable or anything I did or said that offended you or hurt your feelings,” Mr Kennedy said according to screenshots of the text the woman shared with US media. “I never intended you any harm. If I hurt you, it was inadvertent. I feel badly for doing so.” The message was first reported on Friday by the Washington Post and Reuters, which said it had verified the message and linked the phone number it was sent from to Kennedy. Mr Kennedy told the Post “the text message speaks for itself"" declining to comment further. The BBC has contacted Mr Kennedy’s campaign for comment. Ms Cooney was 23 at the time of the alleged assault and was working as a live-in babysitter to Mr Kennedy’s children and at the same time helping him with his legal work. She told the Post that she found the message from Mr Kennedy “disingenuous and arrogant”. “I’m not sure how somebody has a true apology for something that they don’t admit to recalling. I did not get a sense of remorse,” she said. The Vanity Fair story included a number of allegations about the candidate, including that he ate dog meat during a trip abroad, had several extramarital affairs and vigorously defended a cousin, Michael Skakel, who was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old girl in Greenwich, Connecticut. Mr Kennedy, the nephew of President John F Kennedy and son of Robert F Kennedy, called the story a ""lot of garbage"".  He denied eating dog meat and shortly after the story came out he told a podcast: ""I am not a church boy."" “I had a very, very rambunctious youth,” he said. “I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.” He did not directly address the sexual assault allegations.

318,What world leaders thought of Biden’s Nato summit performance,"Western leaders have rallied round Joe Biden at the Nato summit, amid concerns about the US president's age and ability to serve another term. Calls are growing for Mr Biden to drop out of the presidential race this November, and his attempts to diminish fears about his re-election bid at the summit were marred by two serious gaffes. French President Emmanuel Macron said Mr Biden was ""in charge"" and ""clear on the issues he knows well"", while UK PM Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""on good form"". But Mr Biden's first gaffe, in which he introduced Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin, was ridiculed in the Russian media.  And later in a news conference - Mr Biden's first unscripted public appearance since the debate - he referred to his ""Vice-President Trump"" when meaning to say Kamala Harris. The US president has been under pressure to quit since a disastrous performance two weeks ago in a debate with his Republican rival in the upcoming elections, Donald Trump. But throughout the summit, other Nato leaders have defended him and his ability to lead.  Mr Macron, speaking after Thursday's White House dinner, said he had had a long discussion with Mr Biden during the meal, and appealed for understanding of his flaws. ""I saw him as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well,"" he said. ""We all make slips of the tongue sometimes. It has happened to me before, it will probably happen to me tomorrow. ""I would ask you to show the same leniency that should be shown between caring people."" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also addressed the gaffes.  “Slips of the tongue happen, and if you always monitor everyone, you will find enough of them,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir said repeatedly during the summit that the US president had achieved much to be proud of there, and was ""across all the detail"". On Friday he added: ""We've been through two days of this council and come to a very good outcome... And I think he should be given credit for that."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was a privilege and a pleasure to work with Mr Biden. ""[Biden's] depth of experience, his thoughtfulness, his steadfastness on the greatest issues and challenges of our time is a credit to the work that we're all doing together,"" he said. Polish President Andrzej Duda, seen as being close to former President Trump, said, quoted by AFP: ""I talked with President Biden, and there is no doubt that everything is ok."" Meanwhile Finnish President Alexander Stubb combined a defence of Mr Biden with fears about the atmosphere in the US elections. ""I have absolutely no concern about the capacity of the current president of the United States to lead his country and to lead our fight for Ukraine and to lead Nato,"" he said, quoted by AFP. ""The only thing I'm worried about is that the political climate in the United States right now is too toxic, is very polarised, and that doesn't leave enough room for a civilised and constructive debate."" Not all Nato leaders were prepared to weigh in on behalf of Mr Biden, though. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán reportedly made almost no comments to the media in Washington. Instead he left immediately after the end of the summit for Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump's Florida residence, where the two men talked about the war in Ukraine. ""We discussed ways to make peace,"" Mr Orbán said on social media. ""The good news of the day: he's going to solve it!""  But if leaders of allied countries have been unwilling to criticise the US president for his frailties, Moscow has been similarly restrained. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the gaffes were clearly slips of the tongue and ""not our business, an internal matter for the USA"". Not so the Russian media, which have been all over Mr Biden's confusion of Mr Putin with Mr Zelensky. Official Rossiya TV showed it at the top of its 9pm bulletin, saying that ""America's vassals pretended that they'd not noticed anything"". NTV said Biden had never been so close to a fiasco and that his ""latest slip of the tongue is worthy of an Oscar"". And popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets ran an article headlined ""Senile Leaders"", comparing Joe Biden to the elderly Communist leaders of the USSR. ""What's more dangerous, a monkey with a grenade or a shaking hand on the nuclear button?"" it asked.

317,England reaching Euros final feels 'normal' - Southgate,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Reaching final 'feels a little bit more normal' for England - Southgate Gareth Southgate says England felt ""perhaps less satisfaction"" at reaching the Euro 2024 final compared to their Euro 2020 experience. The Three Lions' 2-1 victory against the Netherlands on Wednesday set them up for a second consecutive European Championship final. England finished runners-up at the delayed Euros in 2021, losing 3-2 to Italy in a penalty shootout at Wembley following a 1-1 draw. That was the men's first final appearance since the 1966 World Cup, and now another awaits them on Sunday when Spain will provide the opposition. Southgate has guided England to the semi-finals or further in three of his four major tournaments in charge - World Cups and Euros - without yet winning a trophy. Including fixtures decided on penalty shootouts, Southgate's England have won nine knockout games and lost three, also losing a third-place game. ""There's a different feel [than 2021]. We're now in a different moment as a team, two tournaments on and a lot more big match experience,"" Southgate told BBC Sport. ""I guess there was less of a celebration, perhaps less satisfaction at reaching a final. ""I wouldn't say it becomes run of the mill but it's a little bit more normal for us. That statement in itself is probably a bit ridiculous given our history."" When asked if that meant that winning was now essential, Southgate said, “Yeah, we needed to win the last one! We didn’t. What we do know is that in the end, how we’ll be viewed by others will be determined by the result on Sunday” England have to be 'perfect' to beat Spain - Southgate  We don't care how we win, says England's Watkins Penalties, red cards and shocks - England's 58 years of hurt After being named the Football Association's head of elite development in 2012, Southgate was appointed England's Under-21 manager a year later. He replaced Sam Allardyce as manager of the senior team in 2016. ""What that journey's taught me is what it means to English football really to have credibility on the European and world stage,"" said Southgate. ""I know what it means to people working at every level from youth development all the way through to senior football."" Southgate's England deal, which he extended in November 2021, is due to expire in December. The 53-year-old said he would not be discussing his future before Sunday's final. ""Emotionally it would be impossible for me to make a logical decision at the moment on any of that because my sole focus for two years has been winning this tournament,"" said Southgate. ""The last five or six weeks have been an absolute rollercoaster, so I don't really know where I am with anything other than very focused on preparing the team for this game and determined to keep leading them in the way we have over the last month.""

321,I was arrested because of my baby's birthmark,"The mother of a six-month-old baby said she was treated ""like a criminal"" after her son's birthmarks were mistaken for bruising. Laxmi Thapa's son was born with blue spot - blue-grey markings common on babies with brown or black skin. After being referred to hospital in Basingstoke she was arrested when medical staff and police followed procedures for suspected child abuse. Campaigners have called for better awareness of the condition and said misdiagnosis can be ""devastating"" for wrongly accused families.  Ms Thapa, a Nepalese national living in Basingstoke, had taken her baby to her GP in May after becoming concerned that the blue spot markings had become darker and he had developed new ones. Her son's existing blue spot - sometimes known as Mongolian blue spot - on several parts of his body had been noted in his medical records, following his birth in November. Ms Thapa was referred to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital where she was arrested by police on suspicion of actual bodily harm assault and neglect of her baby. The 29-year-old, who was breastfeeding at the time, spent 20 hours in a cell at Basingstoke Police Station until being released pending a medical report. ""It was hard for me,"" she said. ""I have never been separated from my baby since his birth. ""At that time I was like a criminal. I stayed overnight in a cell like a criminal. ""Without medical proof, they put me in custody."" Her baby was looked after by the hospital while she was detained and she was permitted to express milk to allow him to be fed. After her release, a social services home visit determined her son was not in danger. A series of scans later showed no skeletal injuries and a dermatologist determined the markings were blue spot and not bruises. Police confirmed no assault had taken place. Faye Wheeler, founder of Blue Spot Campaign, said said she receives regular reports of misdiagnosis of the birthmarks, which she said can appear after the a child is born. She said: ""There is a lot of devastation from families and this leads to mistrust with working with health professionals. ""There seems to be a lot of suspicion around blue spot. I feel there is a lack of education, there is a lack of training."" Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it could not comment on individual cases, but said staff ""will have followed guidelines"". ""Safeguarding babies and children will always take priority,"" it said. ""Differentiating between suspected bruising and Mongolian blue spot is complex, and protocols have to be followed."" Det Ch Insp Gemma Anacora, from Hampshire Constabulary, said police  automatically become involved when a case was referred as a child safeguarding issue. She said: ""I do sympathise, it must be a very difficult situation, however we do follow procedures, so her arrest was necessary for us to obtain evidence by questioning and to safeguard the child through bail conditions."" Independent child protection researcher Dr Bernard Gallagher, from the University of Huddersfield, said it was an ""appropriate expectation"" for agencies to intervene when child abuse was suspected. ""Sometimes they make mistakes and maybe they are acting too drastically or too quickly, but it’s a very difficult balance to strike,"" he said. Ms Thapa said she had received a verbal apology from a doctor at the hospital. She is working with local campaign group Basingstoke Unites Against Racism on an official complaint. In a statement it said: ""We are committed to addressing all concerns within the BAME community. This includes collaborating with external organisations, as we did in this case, to ensure comprehensive support."" Ms Thapa said: ""I am going through this situation that was unacceptable and I don't want others to,"" she said. ""I don't want anyone to be separated from their baby like I was.""

335,Biden is teetering. Trump's plan? Let it happen,"As Joe Biden attempted to calm the storm engulfing his presidential re-election campaign, he hit an early snag: referring to ""Vice-President Trump"" during a Thursday press conference when he meant Kamala Harris. Within minutes, Donald Trump mocked the gaffe on his social media platform, Truth Social, with an accompanying clip. ""Great job, Joe!"" he wrote. It was the kind of reaction voters have come to expect from Trump, who has spent years insulting the president, 81. And yet, for the past two weeks, as Mr Biden was fighting for his political life, Trump remained uncharacteristically quiet, letting Democrats argue among themselves. Republican strategists claim the relative silence is down to Trump's new-found discipline - a change from his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. ""He's played it brilliantly by not saying much about the Democratic crisis,"" said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former senior Senate and House leadership aide. ""Why take the shovel away when they're digging their own hole?"" Trump, 78, has not gone entirely underground. Since Mr Biden's poor debate performance in late June, Trump has given a handful of radio interviews, appeared at rallies in Virginia and Florida, and kept up a steady drumbeat of posts on Truth Social. ""The radical left Democratic party is divided in chaos,"" Trump said at a Tuesday campaign rally in Miami. ""They can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president, sleepy, crooked Joe Biden or laughing Kamala."" He also challenged  the president to a golf match, claimed all US airports were dirty, said that visitors to Washington DC end up ""shot, mugged and raped"", claimed 45,000 people were at the Miami event when there were closer to 700, and pondered why ""we don't eat bacon anymore"". But experts say that compared to past behaviour, the Republican has been restrained. Some have suggested Trump's camp may even be delaying his choice for vice-president to avoid stealing attention from Mr Biden's problems. ""If you compare this strategy and execution [in] this campaign to 2016 and 2020, it is far more strategic, far more disciplined,""  said Kevin Madden, a Republican communications expert who worked on Mitt Romney’s presidential bids. With the Democratic Party fracturing over Mr Biden's candidacy, Corey Lewandowski, Trump's 2016 campaign manager, said the approach taken by Trump since the debate had been effective. ""The Trump campaign has done an outstanding job of allowing the Biden campaign to self-destruct,"" he said. That implosion may have been what the Trump campaign was banking on from the start. The Republican plan to win over the American people has, for a while now, leaned on voters' well-documented fears about Mr Biden's age. Speaking to The Atlantic's Tim Alberta, Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita said he had planned for an ""extraordinarily visual"" match-up where Mr Biden was viewed as old and frail while Trump appeared strong and vigorous. ""The debate was exactly what they wanted,"" Mr Madden said. ""They got the perfect split-screen that was going to endure."" A number of recent polls put Trump consistently - if still narrowly - ahead of Mr Biden. But there is concern within the Trump camp that anxiety over Mr Biden's fitness has peaked too soon. Were he to be replaced by a younger nominee, Trump would lose two main lines of attack - age and frailty. And it would be harder to directly blame a new candidate for the president's perceived policy failures: Mr Biden scores badly with voters on the economy and the southern border crisis. ""They're silently hoping, with their fingers crossed, that Biden is the nominee,"" said strategist Ron Bonjean of Trump's campaign. ""They feel they will win the election with Biden as their opponent."" Some of Trump's closest surrogates have seemed to suggest they want Mr Biden to stay on. On Thursday, while Democrats parsed the impact of the president's defiant press conference, Trump's son Don Jr offered rare praise. Mr Biden's performance had been ""not too bad"", he said. ""He did fine enough to be able to stay in it - he doesn't want to go.""  Last week, Trump's daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Lara Trump, suggested it would ""go against the democratic process"" if Mr Biden were to be removed. Nevertheless, Mr Bonjean and other Republican experts made clear that if it was hard for Republicans to take on a new candidate, it would be harder still for Democrats to choose one. ""Yes, it will cause the Trump campaign to scramble a little bit. But their scrambling is not nearly what it will be for the Democrats,"" said Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist who served as chief of staff to former House majority leader Eric Cantor. ""They have to figure out how to nominate somebody else… they have to build a brand-new structure from scratch."" Meanwhile, Republicans are combing through records of Ms Harris and other possible replacements, he said. ""They're not prepared, necessarily, for this, but they are preparing."" Next week, at the Republican party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Trump will reclaim centre stage, officially accepting his party's nomination and making a primetime speech that will set the tone for the final months of his campaign. Mr Heye suggested that the convention - four days of party fanfare built around a candidate who revels in the spotlight - will have made it easier to sell Trump the benefits of the strategy of remaining largely quiet. ""If you're committed to keeping your candidate under wraps for an extended period, there has to be a pay-out later on,"" he said. ""His leadership can say: 'You've got all of next week, it's going to be the Donald Trump show'.""",2024-07-13 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd17yd3jq4ro,"Holly Honderich,",2024-07-13 02:09:08,

Krejcikova, a French Open winner in 2021, held her arms aloft as she sealed a 6-2 2-6 6-4 victory on her third championship point. She shared a warm embrace with Paolini at the net before looking up and blowing a kiss towards the sky. With the victory, Krejcikova, 28, has emulated her late friend and coach Jana Novotna. The 1998 Wimbledon champion died from ovarian cancer in 2017 at the age of 49. ""Jana was the one who told me I had the potential and I should definitely turn pro and try to make it. Before she passed away she told me to go and win a Slam,"" Krejcikova said of her fellow Czech. ""I achieved that in Paris in 2021 and it was an unbelievable moment for me, and I never really dreamed that I would win the same trophy as Jana did in 1998."" The 31st seed also followed in the footsteps of 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova to make it back-to-back triumphs for the Czech Republic in the women's singles. In keeping with Wimbledon tradition, Krejcikova clambered up to the players' box to celebrate with her team and family, many of whom were in tears. ""I don't have any words right now - it's just unbelievable, it's definitely the best day of my tennis career and also the best day of my life,"" she added. As the magnitude of her achievement sank in, Krejcikova, trophy in hand, burst into tears as she left Centre Court. The result is a second straight Grand Slam final defeat for Paolini, who fell to Iga Swiatek in straight sets in last month's French Open showpiece. The 28-year-old was bidding to become Italy's first women's singles champion at Wimbledon. This video can not be played Barbora Krejcikova reacts as she becomes Wimbledon 2024 women's singles champion With both players being unexpected finalists, it was guaranteed there would be a first-time women's champion for the seventh Wimbledon in a row. And after nearly two hours on court, it was Krejcikova's name that was etched on the Venus Rosewater Dish. It had been a difficult season until now for Krejcikova, who has been hampered by a back injury and illness. Between the end of January's Australian Open and this month's Championships, she had played nine singles matches, winning just three. Now she has won through seven matches in the space of two weeks. ""Two weeks ago [in the first round against Veronika Kudermetova] I had a very tough match, and I wasn't in good shape before that because I was injured and ill,"" Krejcikova said. ""I didn't really have a good beginning to the season. It's unbelievable I'm stood here now and I've won Wimbledon. I have no idea [how it happened]."" A seven-time major winner in women's doubles, and a three-time champion in mixed doubles, Krecjikova holds an incredible 12-1 overall win-loss record in Grand Slam finals. She will receive £2.7m in prize money for winning this year's women's singles at Wimbledon.

A late bloomer, she won a prestigious WTA Tour title in Dubai in February before going on a surprising run to the final of the French Open - the first time she had been beyond the fourth round of a major. Her staggering run at Wimbledon showed her appearance in that Roland Garros final was no fluke. The seventh seed has become a fan favourite at the All England Club thanks to her bubbly attitude and sheer doggedness to fight for every point. At the end of a first-set drubbing, Paolini headed off court to reset before emerging with a new-found determination. Having initially appeared to lack her usual cheery energy, she was soon giving fist pumps and a steely look, and she struck early in the second set to get back on track. Backed by the crowd and blessed with a never-say-die attitude, Paolini broke serve again at 5-2 to force a decider - to the delight of many inside Centre Court. Yet Krejcikova did not go away, firing booming groundstrokes until momentum swung her way when Paolini double-faulted to give away the all-important break. Despite fighting until the very end, the 5ft 4in Italian eventually lofted a backhand long on the third championship point. ""The last two months have been crazy for me,"" said a smiling Paolini, who had never won a tour-level match on grass before June. ""Today I am a little bit sad. I try to keep smiling because I have to remember today is still a good day. I made the final of Wimbledon.""

333,Alec Baldwin sobs as Rust trial is ended over hidden evidence,"Alec Baldwin broke down in tears as a New Mexico judge dismissed the involuntary manslaughter case against him for a fatal shooting on the set of the film Rust.  The trial collapsed three days into Baldwin's trial in Santa Fe, at a court just miles from where Halyna Hutchins, a cinematographer, was shot with a revolver that Mr Baldwin was using in rehearsals.  It is the second time the case against the actor has been dismissed since the October 2021 shooting. He will not be tried again. ""There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now,"" Mr Baldwin wrote on Instagram on Saturday. ""To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family."" His lawyers alleged police and prosecutors hid evidence - a batch of bullets - that could have been connected to the shooting.  A key aspect of the case has been how live ammunition ended up on the set and Mr Baldwin’s lawyers have questioned the investigation and mistakes made by authorities who processed the scene.  Their motion to dismiss sparked a remarkable set of events, with one of the two special prosecutors leading the case resigning, and Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissing the jury to hear from multiple witnesses.  The bullets, Mr Baldwin's lawyer said, could be related to Ms Hutchins' death, but were filed in a different case with a different number.  Prosecutors argued the ammunition was not connected to the case and did not match bullets found on the Rust set. The judge ruled, however, that they should have been shared with Mr Baldwin's defence team regardless.  ""The state's wilful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,"" she said from the bench. ""There is no way for the court to right this wrong."" Prosecutors will not be able to lodge the charge against Baldwin again, as the judge did not rule the case a mistrial, but instead outright dismissed it with prejudice.  ""It was the nuclear option. The case is over,"" Los Angeles trial attorney Joshua Ritter told the BBC. Mr Baldwin, best known for his role on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for portraying Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live, wept as the judge read from a lengthy statement detailing her reasons for the dismissal. His wife, Hilaria, covered her mouth. Other members of his family cried and smiled. The actor hugged his lawyers then embraced his wife, who was seated behind him. They walked out hand-in-hand through a tunnel of press into a black vehicle without answering any questions or making any comments.  The evidence came to light on Thursday, when a crime-scene technician told the court that a man named Troy Teske, a retired police officer, had turned over live ammunition that could be related to the case.  Mr Teske is friends with the step-father of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year.  He was working with Seth Kenney, who helped with props and ammunition on the film set. After the judge sent the jury home on Friday, the court heard from a series of witnesses about the bullets, including authorities who led the case and Mr Kenney.  Towards the end of the hearing, one of the prosecutors leading the case - Kari Morrissey - took the stand to testify about the bullets and why they weren't shared with the defence. It's remarkably rare for a prosecutor to testify in a case they bring about their role in the investigation.  Ms Morrissey testified the ammunition had “no evidentiary value” from her perspective. While on the stand, she said that her co-prosecutor, Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, resigned on Friday as the judge weighed to dismiss the case.  She explained Ms Johnson ""didn't agree with the decision to have a public hearing"" over the evidence claims.

331,Hamas-run health ministry says 90 killed in Israeli strike targeting military chief,"The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 90 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a designated humanitarian area. About 300 people have been injured, according to the health ministry's statement, in an attack which Israel says targeted senior Hamas leader Mohammed Deif and his deputy Rafa Salama.  In a news conference on Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was ""no certainty"" that either of them had been killed.  The strike hit the al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis, which the Israeli military has designated as a humanitarian zone. An eyewitness in al-Mawasi told the BBC that the site of the strike looked like an ""earthquake"" had hit. Videos from the area show smouldering wreckage and bloodied casualties being loaded on to stretchers.  People can be seen trying desperately to pick through the rubble of a large crater with their hands. BBC Verify has analysed footage of the aftermath of the strike, confirming that it took place within an area shown on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) website as a humanitarian zone. Mr Netanyahu said he gave the order for the operation to go ahead after being briefed by his general security forces.  He said he wanted to know there were no hostages nearby, the extent of the collateral damage and what kinds of weapons would be used. During the news conference, he promised to eradicate all of the group's senior members.  ""Either way, we will get to the whole of the leadership of Hamas,"" Mr Netanyahu added.  Later Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, quoted by the AFP news agency, accused Mr Netanyahu of seeking to block a ceasefire in the Gaza war with ""heinous massacres"". Hamas said the claim that their leaders were targets was ""false"". ""It is not the first time Israel claims to target Palestinian leaders, only to be proven false later,"" the group said in a statement. An Israeli military official said the strike took place in an ""open area"" where there were ""no civilians"". He refused to say whether it was inside a designated safe zone, but said Hamas leaders had “cynically” set up in a civilian area. The official also said he was unaware of any hostages taken during the 7 October attack on Israel being in the area. He added that ""accurate intelligence"" was gathered before the ""precision strike"".  One of the doctors at a hospital dealing with the aftermath of the attack has told the BBC it is “one of the black days”. Speaking to Newshour on the BBC World Service, Dr Mohammed Abu Rayya said the majority of cases coming in were dead, with others suffering from multiple shrapnel wounds. He said it was like being in ""hell"", adding that many of the casualties were civilians, notably women and children. Footage from the nearby Kuwait field hospital showed scenes of chaos with patients being treated on the floor. The Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis is ""overwhelmed"" and no longer able to function, said British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing the al-Qassam Brigades, is one of Israel's most wanted men. He has near-mythical status in Gaza after escaping capture and surviving several assassination attempts, including one in 2002 when he lost an eye. He was imprisoned by Israeli authorities in 1989, after which he formed the Brigades with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers. Israel accuses him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. It is thought he was one of the masterminds behind the 7 October Hamas attack, when about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages. It led to the major Israeli military operation in Gaza which has killed more than 38,400 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  A Hamas official, cited by Reuters, called Saturday's attack a “grave escalation” that showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire negotiations being held in Qatar and Egypt ended on Friday without success, the BBC understands. Gaza’s Hamas-run civil defence agency said that in a separate incident, 17 people had been killed in an Israeli strike west of Gaza.  The attack is said to have targeted a prayer hall in the Shati refugee camp to the west of Gaza City.  The Israeli military has not yet commented on the claim.",2024-07-13 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyx0qdkn45eo,"Rushdi Abualouf, Tom McArthur and Lucy Clarke-Billings,",2024-07-13 22:50:08,
332,Celebrations continue for star-studded Ambani wedding,"Lavish wedding celebrations for the son of Asia's richest man resumed on Saturday with a star-studded guestlist including Hollywood celebrities, global business leaders and two former British prime ministers. Billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani's youngest son Anant and fiancee Radhika Merchant, both 29, are tying the knot this weekend in Mumbai, India, following months of pre-marriage parties. Saturday will see a blessing ceremony during which the world's rich and famous will greet and pay their respects to the couple at a 16,000-capacity convention centre owned by the Ambani family's conglomerate. This will be followed by a grand party where unconfirmed reports say pop stars Drake, Lana Del Rey and Adele are likely to perform.  It follows a formal ceremony and party on Friday evening which was attended by the likes of socialite Kim Kardashian, actor John Cena and former British leaders Tony Blair and Boris Johnson. Fifa boss Gianni Infantino, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee were also among hundreds of famous figures who made an appearance. ""Great wedding!"" China's ambassador to India Xu Feihong wrote on social media platform X along with footage of the couple from inside the venue. ""Best wishes to the new couple and double happiness!"" This weekend's celebrations end on Sunday with a reception party.  Wedding events earlier this year included a party at the Ambanis' ancestral home, where a purpose-built Hindu temple was unveiled alongside private performances by singers Rihanna and Justin Bieber. Guests included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former US president Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka. In June, the couple embarked on a four-day Mediterranean cruise with 1,200 guests, while singer Katy Perry performed at a masquerade ball at a French chateau in Cannes. The Backstreet Boys, US rapper Pitbull and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli also provided entertainment. Rajan Mehra, chief executive of air charter company Club One Air, told Reuters that the family had rented three Falcon-2000 jets to ferry wedding guests to this week's string of events.  “The guests are coming from all over and each aircraft will make multiple trips across the country,” he said.  On Wednesday, the family hosted a bhandara - a community feast for underprivileged people. Anant's father Mukesh, 66, is chairman of Reliance Industries, a family-founded conglomerate that has grown into India's biggest company by market capitalisation. The patriarch is the world's 11th richest person with a fortune of more than $123bn, according to Forbes. The family's lucrative interests include retail partnerships with Armani and other luxury brands, more than 40% of India's mobile phone market and an Indian Premier League cricket team. His 27-floor family home Antilia is one of Mumbai's most prominent landmarks, reportedly costing more than $1bn to build, with a permanent staff of 600 servants. Merchant is the daughter of well-known pharmaceutical moguls. Key roads in Mumbai are being sealed off for several hours a day until the festivities end on Monday, while social media is awash with minute-by-minute updates. But the extraordinary opulence has also led to a backlash.  People living in the city have complained that road closures have worsened traffic problems caused by monsoon flooding, while others have questioned the ostentatious display of wealth.  The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them, but wedding planners estimate they have already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m].  It was rumoured Rihanna was paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Justin Bieber is $10m. One unnamed executive at Reliance claimed the event was a ""powerful symbol of India's growing stature on the global stage"" in a note shared with reporters. But opposition politician Thomas Isaac said it was ""obscene"". ""Legally it may be their money but such ostentatious expenditure is a sin against mother earth and [the] poor,"" he posted on X.",2024-07-13 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x22w0xl0o,"Zoya Mateen & Meryl Sebastian,",2024-07-13 12:09:08,
329,"'I'm not a believer in fairytales, but I am a believer in dreams'","This video can not be played Euro 2024: 'I am not a believer in fairytales, but I am a believer in dreams' Gareth Southgate says he is ""not a believer in fairytales but is a believer in dreams"" as he prepares to lead England in Sunday's Euro 2024 final against Spain. The men's team are looking to end their wait for a first trophy since winning the 1966 World Cup. Southgate featured as a player at Euro 1996, which was played in England but won by Germany. Asked if he felt it was fate the Three Lions now have the chance to win a European Championship in Germany, he said: ""I am not a believer in fairytales but I am a believer in dreams.  ""We have had big dreams and felt the importance of that, but you have to make those things happen. “The run we’ve had, the late goals and penalties, doesn’t equate to it being our moment. We have to make it tomorrow and perform.  ""It would be a lovely story and it's in our hands but the performance is the most important thing."" Gareth Southgate has led England to a second successive European Championship final Back in that 1996 tournament, Southgate missed the decisive shootout penalty in the semi-final against Germany. The current England team have also gone through difficult experiences at recent tournaments, losing on penalties to Italy in the final of Euro 2020 and exiting at the quarter-final stage at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after losing to France. They were seconds away from going out of the Euros at the last-16 stage against Slovakia until Jude Bellingham's overhead kick took the game to extra time and Harry Kane’s header sealed victory. Since then, they have beaten Switzerland on penalties and come from behind to see off the Netherlands to reach the final. Southgate believes his players should go into Sunday's final at Berlin's Olympiastadion against a strong Spain side better for their past experiences. ""I don't have any fear about what might happen [against Spain] because I've been through everything,"" he added. ""I want the players to feel that fearlessness. I want them to be able to be the best version of themselves because, whatever happens, we're so strong as a group."" England beat Switzerland on penalties to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2024 England captain Harry Kane says the final defeat to Italy at Wembley has given him and his team-mates that extra motivation to put things right by beating Spain. Asked what it would mean to lift the European Championship trophy, he added: ""It would mean everything. It would be the most incredible feeling. ""For the fans to have that moment in history and celebrate that, it would be special. ""We have been here before, it was a tough finish in the last Euros, there's extra hunger and fire in our belly to make sure this one goes our way."" For Kane, victory on Sunday would also see the 30-year-old win a first trophy for club or country. The Bayern Munich striker is both England and Tottenham's all-time leading scorer, won the 2018 World Cup golden boot, the 2024 Champions League golden boot and three Premier League top-scorer awards. Asked if he would swap all of those accolades in an instant for victory against Spain, Kane said: ""Of course, it's no secret that I haven't won a team trophy. ""Every year that goes by, you're more motivated and you're more determined to change that and now I have the opportunity to win one of the biggest trophies you could ever win and to make history with my nation. ""I'm extremely proud to be English. I'd swap everything in my career to have a special night by winning [on Sunday]."" This video can not be played Euro 2024: I'm determined to make tomorrow special - Kane Under Southgate, England have reached back-to-back European Championship finals as well as the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the last eight of the tournament in Qatar four years later. The Three Lions boss believes his side now have the mentality of being a team that reaches the latter stages of major tournaments - and feels they now need to take that next step by winning Euro 2024. ""I've travelled to World Cups, European Championships, watching as an observer and watched highlight reels of matches on the big screens - and we weren't in any of them,” Southgate said. ""We needed to change that. We had high expectations but they didn't match where we were performance-wise. Now the high expectations are still there but we've had consistent performances, certainly over three of the last four tournaments and a quarter-final in the fourth. ""In the end you have to be in the latter stages of tournaments to learn how to win the big games.  ""A lot of records we have broken but we know we have to do this one, to get this trophy to really feel the respect of the footballing world."" Spain have been impressive at Euro 2024, winning all six of their games in either 90 or 120 minutes and beating France and hosts Germany along the way. In contrast, England have received criticism for some of their performances at this tournament. But Spain boss Luis de la Fuente believes all that counts for nothing on Sunday. ""We know there is no favourite, it is a very, very equal game,"" he said. ""We know that if we don't play above the level we have shown so far, are not completely focused - we won't be able to win if we don't do all of that.""

328,"High on Yamal fever, Spaniards think Euros victory is theirs","""This undoubtedly surprises you more than it surprises us,"" Spain’s manager Luis de la Fuente told his country’s journalists. His team had just beaten France in the European Championship semi-finals, setting up a showdown with England in Sunday’s final. And surprise - of the pleasant kind - is perhaps the best word to describe what many Spanish fans have been feeling throughout this tournament. Expectation was low on Spain's sun-kissed streets as the Euros got underway, but that has quickly become national jubilation, helping to bring this much-divided country together. Quite a difference to the trials and tribulations of Three Lions supporters. ""At first my friends and myself thought that the players selected were a very personal choice of the coach and didn’t represent the opinion of most Spaniards,"" said Jorge Gallego, a Spain fan in Madrid. ""We didn’t expect to reach the final but throughout the tournament we started to realise that we could go far."" While an estimated 11,500 Spanish fans have travelled to Berlin for the final, back home giant screens are being installed in parks, sports centres and squares on which to watch it. Here in Madrid, local authorities have said that, if Spain wins, victory celebrations will take place around the Plaza de Cibeles in the capital’s centre. Meanwhile, the players are being lauded, among them defender Marc Cucurella, who has become a folk hero thanks to his big hair and an online song about him which has gone viral. The lyrics feature paella and beer - it's a chant often heard in the stands of his league club, Chelsea. The buoyant atmosphere surrounding the football contrasts with Spain’s rancorous and often toxic politics, where the left-wing government and right-wing opposition seldom agree on anything. The football team provides a rare rallying point. Parties and politicians have celebrated not just the results but the emergence of players, like Lamine Yamal, who turned 17 on Saturday and has turned out to be the star. This team also represents Spain’s multi-cultural reality. Yamal’s father is Moroccan and his mother is from Equatorial Guinea, while Nico Williams’s Ghanaian parents reached Spain after travelling across the Sahara Desert and scaling a fence that surrounds the enclave of Melilla. Yamal has underlined his humble origins, holding his fingers up after scoring to show the postcode 304, the working-class, multi-cultural district of the Catalan town of Mataró where he grew up. It’s a place that a member of the far-right Vox party, Manuel Gavira, once described as a ""multi-cultural dung heap"".  But the overwhelming sensation is that Spaniards are embracing their team, both for its performances and what it represents. El Periódico newspaper said ""a young Spain, sassy and reinvigorated, has become the mirror for a country which has changed and is multi-racial and diverse"". Even King Felipe joined in the plaudits, saying that the men’s team, radiated ""excitement, joy and security"", while praising the ""sparkle"" of Yamal. It's easy to forget that Yamal's selection raised eyebrows and led to accusations that De la Fuente - a relatively junior coach who had never worked with a top-flight club - did not have the experience to succeed.  On the face of it, the team was a far cry from the star-studded side that conquered two European titles and the World Cup between 2008-2012. Now, there is a feeling that the national team has returned to the elite, restoring the self-esteem of Spanish fans in the process. Results are an obvious reason for the renewed belief. It has six wins out of six – a first for any team in the Euros – against opponents that included not just Didier Deschamps’s France, but also hosts Germany and Euro 2020 champions Italy. The style of those victories has also been crucial. Gone is the close-passing, possession-obsessed ""tiki-taka"" play which brought Spain so much success in the past. Instead, Spain is playing more directly, with two of its emerging stars, Williams and Yamal, wreaking havoc down the wings. The result is a less controlled and more thrilling style than in the past.

327,Celebrity sex therapist Dr Ruth Westheimer dies at 96,"Renowned sex therapist and talk show host Dr Ruth Westheimer, who spoke openly about sex and intimate subjects, died on Friday at 96 years old.  Her publicist confirmed her death to BBC News partner CBS News without providing a cause.  Ruth Westheimer, often referred to as Dr Ruth, became known for talking openly about sex, becoming a pop culture icon as well as a best-selling author with guides like ""Sex for Dummies"".  She pushed for having open conversations about sex with a non-judgmental approach.  Dr Ruth, who spoke with a German accent, is a Holocaust survivor who was born in Frankfurt, Germany.  In the 1980s, she had her own local radio program called ""Sexually Speaking"" which became well recognized and placed her on the path to national fame when it was nationally syndicated in 1984.  She wrote her first book, Dr Ruth's Guide to Good Sex, in 1983 in which she aimed to demystify sex. It was the first of more than 40 books she authored.  Dr Ruth launched a television program the following year called The Dr. Ruth Show and wrote a nationally syndicated advice column.  “I knew that there is a lot of knowledge that is around but doesn’t get to young people,” Dr Ruth told NBC Nightly News in 2019.  Dr Ruth frequently made appearances on talk shows including The Howard Stern Radio Show, the Dr. Oz Show, Nightline, the Tonight Show and Late Night with David Letterman.   Last November, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced Dr Ruth would become the state's honorary ambassador to loneliness.  ""I am deeply honoured and promised the governor that I will work day and night to help New Yorkers feel less lonely!"" Dr Ruth said at the time.  Born in 1928 as Karola Ruth Siegel, at ten-years-old her parents sent her to Switzerland to escape Kristallnacht, a violent riot Nazis carried out against Jews before the Holocaust.  Dr Ruth never saw her parents after leaving for Switzerland and believed they were killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz - a Nazi death camp.

330,Trump rushed off stage at rally as bangs heard,"Secret Service agents have rushed former President Donald Trump off stage after what sounded like gunshots rang out at a rally in Pennsylvania. Footage showed him grimace and raise a hand to his ear, before ducking as sharp cracks - apparently shots - broke out.  He was quickly swarmed by secret service agents and rushed off stage to a waiting vehicle.  In a statement Trump's campaign said he was ""fine"" and was being ""checked out"" at a local medical facility.  “President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act,” spokesman Steven Cheung said.  The former president appeared to have blood on his right ear and raised a fist as he was led off stage.  Armed police took to the podium soon after.  In a statement, the Secret Service said Trump was safe and that measures for his protection had been implemented.  They added that an active investigation was now under way and that further information would be released when available.  The Republican candidate for president had been addressing his supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania - a crucial swing state in November's election.  Multiple bangs rang out as Trump attacked his successor, President Joe Biden, and his administration.  Several supporters holding placards and standing behind Trump ducked as the apparent shots were heard.  The White House said President Biden, who is in his home state of Delaware, has received an initial briefing.  This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

336,Meet the tycoons behind the grand Indian wedding,"For the last few months, Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has been grabbing the spotlight in India. It's not because he has completed a major acquisition or cut a big philanthropic cheque, but it's his son’s grandiose wedding celebrations that have entranced the entire nation and the world. The pre-wedding parties, which began in March, have put the Ambani family firmly at the centre of many breakfast, lunch and dinner table conversations. Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant at a family-owned convention centre in Mumbai on Friday, in a culmination of six-month-long festivities that have taken place across the globe. Indian weddings can be lavish, but the sheer scale and size of the Ambani jamboree have perhaps eclipsed the celebratory fervour displayed by erstwhile royals. The unerring presence of Bollywood A-listers at every party, the million-dollar performances by global pop-stars like Rihanna and Justin Bieber, and a bevy of VVIP dignitaries descending upon the celebrations have been a source of endless fodder for the paparazzi. Consider some of the global elite who made it to the functions - Meta’s Mark Zuckerburg, Samsung CEO Han-Jong Hee, Bill Gates, former US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, former UK prime ministers Boris Johnson and Sir Tony Blair, Fifa president Gianni Infantino and the Kardashian sisters. And the list goes on. “These are very busy people. They aren’t coming just to have fun,” James Crabtree, author of The Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India’s New Gilded Age, told the BBC.  ""What this tells you is that global business leaders believe the Ambanis are strategically important and also that they see India as a very big market."" Meet the family The Ambanis are often described as India’s most prominent business family.  They run Reliance Industries, an oil to telecoms conglomerate that was founded by Mukesh Ambani's father Dhirubhai Ambani - a man with a controversial legacy who attained legendary status for deftly navigating India’s controversial pre-liberalisation polity, while creating enormous wealth for his company’s shareholders. Dhirubhai died in 2002, and the empire he founded was split between his two sons – Anil and Mukesh – after what could be described as one of India's most acrimonious succession battles. Since then, the brothers’ fortunes have diverged, with the younger Anil declaring bankruptcy and Mukesh pivoting more and more to consumer-facing businesses, even while retaining his pole position in Reliance’s mainstay - petrochemicals.  His oil refinery in the western town of Jamnagar is the largest in the world.  In recent years, Reliance has brought some of the world’s most celebrated luxury brands to India, from Valentino to Versace and Burberry to Bottega. Among other things, the company now owns a team in the world's richest cricket tournament and the iconic British toy retailer Hamleys. In 2021, it acquired the historic country club Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire for £57m. Earlier this year, Reliance signed a binding pact to merge its entertainment platforms with Disney, in its latest attempt to transform the company’s industrial moorings. It is a deal that makes Mukesh Ambani a formidable player in the digital streaming space, with rights to cricketing tournaments and international shows. But the conglomerate really began its shopping spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, when it got billions of dollars in investment from more than a dozen global players, including Meta and Google. The plan with Meta has been to connect WhatsApp’s more than 400 million users in India with its online grocery platform JioMart. The company’s aggressive pricing strategy has mounted a serious challenge to foreign entrants like Netflix and Amazon.  Privately, foreign players, who compete in the same sectors as Reliance, sometimes complain of a lack of level playing field, claiming the Ambanis are among a select few who’ve benefited from the Indian government’s policy of awarding preferential contracts to local tycoons. “Foreign players face a difficult choice,” says Mr Crabtree. “They can either fight with Reliance or get into bed with Reliance. Zuckerburg has chosen to partner with them, while Amazon has decided to fight. But these battles are often very costly, and foreigners end up losing.” Now, Mukesh Ambani's next target is financial services, with Reliance entering into a joint venture with US-based BlackRock for a brokering and wealth management business. Not surprisingly then, for the Ambanis, this is much more than just a wedding.  It is a show of strength and of the clout they command, says Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist. “It’s a show of the fact that this family is a magnet that attracts people from all walks of life - business, politics and entertainment.” The media blitzkrieg around it, he adds, is also a way for them to make a personal event “even more personal to the whole world” – such as the consumers of Reliance products and services for instance – who would never have got an invite. If the Ambani patriarch, Dhirubhai, was credited with introducing the stock market to India’s retail investors, his son Mukesh is well recognised for creating a myriad touchpoints between his businesses and the average Indian consumer. A bulk of what Indians consume today, from the shows they watch, to the clothes they wear and potentially even how they will transact in the future, comes from the Ambani stable. And that is why there couldn’t have been a better occasion than a dazzling wedding for the family to market its brand to India’s burgeoning consumer class. And sure enough, the wedding has captivated people in India and across the world. ",2024-07-13 23:09:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yp353g0ro,"Nikhil Inamdar,",2024-07-13 01:09:10,
337,How Banksy sparked a steel town's love for colour,"When Banksy artwork Season's Greetings appeared on a garage in Port Talbot in 2018 it kicked off a three-year saga that ended in it being removed from the town. But more than five years on it has left a lasting legacy - a vibrant street art community. ""There were people doing it anyway,"" said steelworker and street artist Ryan Davies. ""But there's no two ways about it - when Banksy turned up in town, that really kicked off a scene here that had been bubbling under."" Anyone paying a visit to the steel town could not help but notice its ever-growing collection of street art - everything from imposing murals to graffiti lettering and tagging. ""Port Talbot is renowned for it now,"" said Ryan. Ryan, a boiler man at the local steelworks for 33 years, began painting on walls over two years ago. When he is not on shift he can be found painting alongside twin brothers Matthew and Aiden Cole. Together they are known as THEW Creative. On a Friday afternoon they were at Margam Football Club, which had commissioned  them to paint a mural on its clubhouse in the shadow of the steel plant's blast furnaces. With looming mass job cuts at the steelworks, Ryan said it was a welcome distraction from the day job, where people were feeling ""very demoralised"". ""With me coming up to 50, I’m lucky enough to have paid off my mortgage... but there’s boys in their twenties there and they’ve just taken on mortgages, they've got young kids and a long way to go before retirement - so for them it’s very, very nerve-wracking,"" he said.  Ryan said having colourful street art around the town was a hopeful sight during difficult times.  ""It makes you think the town might actually have a chance and it's not just about the steelworks,"" he added. ""[The Banksy] made the common person realise that it's not just anti-social, art is art,"" said Aiden.  ""People started realising ‘we could have art in our garden, on our children’s bedroom wall, on our football club, on our restaurant - it has really bloomed and there’s a nice scene going on in Port Talbot at the moment."" But not everyone in Port Talbot is a fan. ""We got accused of making the place look like a third world country the other day by a random old man - fair enough,"" said Aiden.  ""But overwhelmingly it’s a positive reaction, I would say,"" added Ryan. ""You can’t please everyone, can you,"" added his friend. It was back in December 2018 when Season’s Greetings appeared on steelworker Ian Lewis’ garage in Taibach, and following online speculation it was soon claimed by the famous anonymous street artist. With an estimated 20,000 visitors flocking to see the artwork, wardens were drafted in to control traffic and film star Michael Sheen, who grew up in the area, helped pay for a protective plastic screen and round-the-clock security. It was eventually bought by gallery owner John Brandler and taken to a building in the town centre so it could be viewed by the public.  But once an agreement to keep it there expired Mr Brandler moved it out of Wales in February 2022. ""It was a travesty,"" recalled Ryan. ""It was taken away from us, a very rich person came in and bought it and off it went."" When this was put to Mr Brandler he said he had bought the artwork intending to keep it in the town and create an international street art museum - but the idea had been scrapped by the local council. A spokeswoman from Neath Port Talbot council said at the time: ""Discussions were held on the potential for the work to remain in Port Talbot but the council was informed it would have to meet the costs of its removal and installation into a new venue, to continue to cover the insurance and to pay a fee in the region of £100,000 per year for the loan of the work."" Recalling the dispute, Mr Brandler said: ""I was travelling to Wales virtually every week costing me a day-and-a-half of my business time to have meetings, to be greeted by the phrase that it wasn't going to happen because - and I quote - 'Banksy isn't Welsh'."" He added he was ""so, so saddened"" that the artwork had not been able to remain in the town which he said was ""in dire need of tourism"". Thirty miles away in Cardiff, the Banksy effect is also being felt. There, graffiti writer Amelia Thomas, better known as Unity, said: ""People have their own feelings about Banksy, but something that can't be disputed is one thing that Banksy has done is raise the profile of people painting on walls being acceptable. ""There's a lot of people in Port Talbot who had already been painting for years and not getting any recognition, so it's a bit barmy that it takes someone from outside to paint something for people to actually appreciate the local people."" Amelia grew up in rural Llanfihangel Talyllyn in Powys, and said she had always been drawn to ""making marks on walls"". ""I was getting into trouble because no-one else was doing it and it was quite obviously me,"" she said. Everything changed when she saw a graffiti magazine at her cousin’s house. ""I was like ‘Oh, my God, there's other people doing this, that's what I'm being drawn to."" After moving to Cardiff in the mid 2000s she found walls where she could paint ""without getting hassled"". ""It's much easier to paint on the street without having people hassling you now, because people are used to seeing it for one. But also and there are places where you can say, ‘I'm allowed to be here, it's nothing to do with you, leave me alone’,"" she said. Many places around the UK have open walls where artists are able to paint. ""That’s a massive step from where things were,"" said Amelia. For Amelia, expressing herself through art is a way of protecting her mental health. ""It’s about raising awareness to the public that actually, this is something that's benefiting the person that's painting, they're not doing it to annoy you, they're doing it because it's something that they need to do, that they're compelled to do and that helps them keep their head above the water, because that's what it is for me,"" she said. ""When you're painting, nothing else in the world exists. It's just you and that wall."" Hasan Kamil grew up in Swansea with a passion for creating graffiti art. After spending five years working as a graphic designer he now lives in Bristol, and works creating large-scale murals and bespoke lettering. When he is outside painting murals people frequently stop to ask him about his work, so he said he has a good gauge about how the public feel about art popping up on buildings, walls and underpasses. ""The average perception [says] 'I love the street art but hate the graffiti, hate the tagging',"" he said. ""But they don't realise they coexist and graffiti was kind of there first, so I will always be a big advocate for graffiti."" There’s another frequent comment. ""The B word - Banksy. ‘You’re not Banksy are you?’ You get that a lot.""",2024-07-13 23:09:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cerrz8edyd0o,"Nicola Bryan,",2024-07-13 06:09:10,
338,I cannot forgive Mugabe's soldiers – massacre survivor,"An astounding number of mass graves surround Thabani Dhlamini’s home in south-western Zimbabwe. One pointed out to the BBC lies near the ablution block at a primary school in the village of Salankomo in Tsholotsho district. Teachers were killed and dumped there in the 1980s. In another, steps away from Mr Dhlamini’s house, 22 relatives and neighbours are buried in two graves - all killed by Zimbabwe’s military under the command of then-leader Robert Mugabe. Mr Dhlamini was just 10 at the time - but the slightly built, soft-spoken farmer is still haunted by the memories. “We were not able [to talk about it] and we were in fear to speak about it,” the 51-year-old told the BBC. They were all victims of ethnic killings between 1983 and 1987, when Mugabe unleashed the North Korean-trained Five Brigade in strongholds of Joshua Nkomo, his arch-rival.  Some describe what followed as a genocide. It is not known how many people died - some estimates put it at more than 20,000 people. Nkomo was a veteran freedom fighter from the south-western province of Matabeleland who, more than two decades after his death, is still fondly known as “Father Zimbabwe”. The two men had had a fractious relationship during the long liberation struggle against white-minority rule - Nkomo came from Zimbabwe's Ndebele minority and Mugabe from the nation's Shona majority. They fell out two years after independence in 1980, when Mugabe fired Nkomo from the coalition government, accusing his party of plotting a coup. Operation Gukurahundi was launched, which at the time the government said was a counter-insurgency mission to root out dissidents who had been attacking civilians. “Gukurahundi” means “cleansing rain” in the Shona language. Those targeted by the elite soldiers were mainly from the Ndebele ethnic group in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces, and the killings laid the foundation for lingering ethnic tensions. Mugabe ruled for another three decades - only after he was deposed by his former deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa did it seem that Gukurahundi might be properly confronted, even though he has also been accused of involvement. Mr Mnangagwa made a point of addressing the subject of reconciliation, given the criticism over how various initiatives to allow exhumations and reburials had foundered. Even so it has taken seven years for President Mnangagwa to establish what he has called the Gukurahundi Community Engagement Programme. A series of village-level hearings, where survivors can air their grievances, is set to follow Sunday's launch. Mr Dhlamini said he would take part in the hearings. “I want to free myself from what I witnessed, I need to vent out what I felt,” he said, tapping his chest. He, along with a group of boys from his village in 1983, saw how soldiers frog-marched 22 women, including his mother, into a hut which they then set on fire. When the women broke down the door to flee the flames, the soldiers mowed them down with their guns before they could escape. Mr Dhlamini’s mother was the only survivor as she managed to hide along the side of a nearby grain hut. The soldiers then ordered the older boys in the terrified group watching nearby to carry the bullet-ridden bodies of the women into the smoking hut and another alongside it. Mr Dhlamini’s 14-year-old friend Lotshe Moyo was one of them - but because he was wearing a pin supporting Nkomo, afterwards he too was ordered inside, shot and both huts burnt to ashes. Today their remains are still in the ruins - an overgrown area surrounded by a chain-link fence and lots of crosses. On a whitewashed brick wall, the names of the dead are inscribed. “When we started talking about it my memory returns and it seems as if it had happened today. It makes me feel as if I can cry,” said Mr Dhlamini, who added that his mother had been so traumatised she had never been able to live in the village. Victims and survivors’ families are divided over whether the new government initiative will bring healing and change their fortunes. In the neighbouring village of Silonkwe, 77-year-old Julia Mlilo shuffles slowly to meet us. She can barely walk now, but remembers every detail of what happened on 24 February 1983. At the sound of gunfire she had dropped her hoe in the field where she was working and escaped into the bush with her husband and children. When they emerged her father and more than 20 of her husband’s relatives had been badly assaulted and burnt, many beyond recognition. “Only the heads were identifiable,” she said. They gathered up the remains into a tin basin that had been used for bathing and buried them in a nearby pit. The place where they were slaughtered and the area of their burial, adjacent to a field of crops, are now marked by reflective white and red crosses. “I haven’t forgiven them, I don’t know what would make me forgive. Whenever I see soldiers I feel the pain and I start trembling,” Ms Mlilo told the BBC. “I don’t trust the process because it's being done by the government, but I will take part in it,” she said. While Gukurahundi has ended, many believe they are still being punished.  Tsholotsho, like many parts of Matabeleland, remains a desolate and forsaken area, with little to no infrastructure and very little development over the last 40 years. And since the 1980s the findings of various commissions of inquiry into the atrocities have never been made public. During the Mugabe era, a programme to give identity documents to children whose parents had perished or disappeared did begin and continues. But previous public hearings and exhumation programmes have stalled. In Bulawayo, the main city in Matabeleland, Mbuso Fuzwayo from the local pressure group Ibhetshu LikaZulu spoke to the BBC as he collected a metal plaque to commemorate those killed in Silonkwe. Several plaques commissioned by the group have been stolen or destroyed - a sign, he believes, that Zimbabwe is still not ready to confront its past. The country has a long history of human rights abuses and impunity dating back to the white-minority government when it was called Rhodesia. “We have a lot of violations of the people. What happened during the liberation struggle is that there was no-one who was brought to justice,” Mr Fuzwayo sid. “After the genocide no-one was taken to justice,” he said, referring to Gukurahundi. “What we are saying is that once justice takes place, people will start to respect the rights of other people.” The suspicion and misgivings about the latest process are a big hurdle for President Mnangagwa to overcome as he presents himself as an honest broker, with a genuine desire to reunite Zimbabwe and redress the past. He was minister of state security during the massacres, which explains the wariness felt towards him in the south-west. Some of that strong opposition comes from traditional leaders who will be conducting the hearings. Chief Khulumani Mathema from Gwanda North feels the process is fundamentally flawed. “It needs to be a national issue that focuses on international best practices, which is how genocides are addressed in the whole world,” he told the BBC. Everyone in the region was touched by the atrocities and has a story to tell. As a young boy, the chief was beaten up by soldiers. “We’ve got countries that went through genocide. We’ve got Rwanda, we’ve got Germany, but we want to create and reinvent the wheel, which I think is not feasible,” he said. “There’s no single genocide that has ever been completely solved when the perpetrators are still in charge of the levers of power.” Mr Fuzwayo, whose grandfather was allegedly abducted and never heard from again during the massacres, agrees. “They must not try to say this was a Mugabe thing. It was a collective thing. The chief perpetrator might be dead, that is Mugabe - but Emerson Mnangagwa remains in the absence of Mugabe,” the 48-year-old said. Despite the continued finger-pointing, Mr Mnangagwa has always denied accusations he played an active role in Gukurahundi and successive governments have rejected allegations that the operation amounted to genocide. Chief Mathema said the priorities of communities would be to exhume and identify bodies from the mass graves and allow families space to mourn their relatives appropriately. But he believes there is another piece of the puzzle that the government will need to complete - truth-telling about what happened and the whereabouts of the disappeared. This new inquiry will test President Mnangagwa’s sincerity - will the hearings get to hear from the perpetrators? Will they open up and provide answers to the survivors? Will the findings of previous investigations now be made public? “Up to today we don’t know why the people were killed - the motive,” said Mr Fuzwayo. “And they don’t want to talk about it and I still believe that they have got a lot that they are hiding.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

339,"As Apple headset reaches Europe, will VR ever hit the mainstream?","To get a sense of the public interest in the Vision Pro, Apple's very high-tech, very expensive virtual reality (VR) headset - finally launched in the UK and Europe on Friday - where better to head than one of its own stores? In the past, people camped outside Apple branches overnight, so desperate were they to get their hands on the tech giant's latest product. When I went to its branch in central London on Friday morning, though, there was just a small group, mainly comprised of men, waiting for the doors to open. Partly, that's because people these days prefer the convenience of pre-orders.  But it also perhaps tells us something about the question that continues to hang over the VR headset market: will it ever escape the realm of tech aficionados and go truly mainstream? Apple's plan to make its product break through is to position it as a product you use to do the stuff you already do – only better. Home videos become 3D-like, panoramic photos stretch from floor to ceiling, 360 degrees around you. Apple keeps reminding me it calls this “spatial content”. Nobody else does. Plenty suck their teeth at the Vision Pro's price though - a whopping £3,499. Facebook owner Meta has been watching Apple’s approach closely. It’s been in the VR game a long time. At a recent demo for the Meta Quest 3, which has been available in the UK since 2023, the team was very keen to talk to me about “multi-tasking” – having multiple screens in action at once. In a demo I had a web browser, YouTube and Messenger in a line in front of me. “We always did this, we just didn’t really talk about it,” one Meta worker told me. And in its most recent advertisement, a man wears a Quest 3 to watch video instructions while building a crib. Not the most exciting concept, perhaps, but it shows just how Meta wants people to see its tech. Oh - and it costs less than £500. Apple and Meta are the two big players but VR is a crowded market - there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of different headsets already out there.  But what unites them all is none have quite hit the mainstream. Up until now, the Vision Pro has only been on sale in the US - research firm IDC predicts it will shift fewer than 500,000 units this year. Meta, which has been in the market longer, does not release sales data for the Quest either but it's thought to have sold around 20 million worldwide. VR headsets are nowhere near as ubiquitous as tablets, let alone mobile phones. And it gets worse - George Jijiashvili, analyst at market research firm Omdia, said of those devices sold, many are abandoned. “This is largely due to the limited in-flow of compelling content to keep up engagement,” he said. But of course lack of content leads to reduced interest - and a reduced incentive for developers to make that content in the first place. ""It's a chicken and egg situation,"" Mr Jijiashvili told the BBC. Alan Boyce, the founder of mixed reality studio DragonfiAR, warned that early adopters of the Vision Pro would have to “be patient” while more content arrived. That's where the Quest 3 wins out for him - it already has a ""robust library"" of games, and it can perform virtual desktop tasks just like the Vision Pro. And IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo says we should not be too quick to write off a slow start for Apple’s new product. “There’s always the expectation that Apple with every single product will sell in the millions straight away, there’s always the comparison with the iPhone,” he said. But the reality is even the iPhone took time to find its feet - and a huge number of buyers. According to Melissa Otto from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the iPhone only became mainstream when the App Store ""started to explode with apps that added value to our lives"". ""When people start to feel their lives are becoming better and more convenient, that's when they're willing to take the leap,"" she said. There is another factor to consider here too though: the physical experience of using a headset. Both Apple and Meta use so-called ""passthrough"" technology to enable what is known as mixed reality - the blending of the real and computer-generated worlds. By utilising cameras on the outside of the headset, users are given a live, high-definition video feed of their surroundings - meaning they can wear it while doing things like walking or exercising. But strapping something to your face weighing half a kilogram is not something that feels particularly natural. Generally headsets now are lighter than before, but I still can’t imagine wearing any of them for hours on end - though a colleague says he often does just this. A sizeable number of people, myself included, have experienced VR sickness, which is when being in VR makes you feel queasy. This has significantly improved as the tech has advanced and is much less of a problem - but any experience that has you moving around with a controller instead of your feet will still take some getting used to.  Most VR experiences now include all sorts of settings to avoid this, such as the ability to ""teleport"" between locations. Sony's VR game Horizon: Call of the Mountain solved the problem by letting you move by swinging your arms up and down - it sounds silly, but it goes some way to trick the brain and avoid nausea. Whatever the experts say, the companies themselves appear bullish about their products, and their respective strengths It’s no secret that the long-term ambition from the tech giants here is for mixed, or augmented, reality to become normal reality. Facebook owner Meta renamed itself after its grand plan for us all to inhabit a virtual world called the Metaverse – working, resting and playing there, and presenting ourselves as digital avatar versions of our ordinary selves. That all seems to have gone a bit quiet at the moment. But they are all right in that one day, something will replace our phones and perhaps that thing is some form of VR headset. Eventually, I expect these things will start to look more like glasses and less like giant ski goggles... if they’re not brain implants (I’m not joking). ""The devices that look like what they look like today - I think we know that's not a mass market device. It's too heavy, it's too awkward,"" said Mr Jijiashvili.  That's an area where rivals have focused their efforts, with Viture and XReal producing sunglasses with high-fidelity screens embedded in them. Melissa Brown, head of Development Relations at Meta, told us she “absolutely” thought the Quest 3 could one day replace the smartphone. But the next day Meta’s PR team got in touch with a more measured response from Mark Zuckerberg, in which he said ""the last generation of computing doesn't go away... it's not like when we got phones, people stopped using computers"". Judging by what I saw in the Apple store in London’s Regent Street, the UK is not about to be flooded with people wandering around in Vision Pros or Quest 3s.  The very first customer I spoke to had actually just popped in for a charger and was a bit bemused by Apple staff applause as he walked in.

340,Restrictions on Trump's Facebook and Instagram lifted,"Meta has lifted the final restrictions on Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in the run up to US presidential elections in November. The ex-US president and convicted felon’s accounts were suspended in 2021 after he praised supporters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Trump’s accounts, which combined have over 60 million followers, were re-instated in 2023 but subject to additional monitoring, which has now been removed, the social media giant said in a blog post. Meta said it had a responsibility to allow political expression and that Americans should be able to hear from presidential nominees on an equal basis. It added that US presidential candidates ""remain subject to the same Community Standards as all Facebook and Instagram users, including those policies designed to prevent hate speech and incitement to violence."" Since returning to Meta’s platforms, Trump’s accounts have mostly posted campaign details and memes including attacks on his presidential race rival Joe Biden. Prior to his 2021 ban, Trump’s Facebook posts were often some of the most popular in the US, according to data at the time from CrowdTangle. Trump is the first former president to be convicted of a crime and was also banned from Twitter and YouTube. Restrictions on these accounts were also lifted last year, but despite this Trump communicates now on Truth Social, a social media platform he owns, before reposting to other networks. Trump returned to Twitter - now called X – after the company’s CEO Elon Musk held a poll that asked users to click ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether Trump's account should be reinstated. ""Yes"" won, apparently with 51.8% of the vote. The big tech companies acted after the deadly Capitol Hill riots which injured more than 100 police officers. Trump was accused of inciting violence and repeatedly spreading disinformation.",2024-07-13 23:09:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngj2x5638o,"Tom McArthur,",2024-07-13 09:09:10,
346,Bear rescued from Ukraine dies in West Lothian zoo,"A bear rescued from the war in Ukraine and rehomed in a West Lothian zoo has died. Staff at Five Sisters Zoo in West Calder said they were ""utterly devastated"" that Yampil had died following an anaesthetic procedure. The 12-year-old Asiatic black bear had been rehomed at the zoo in January after being rescued from the village of Yampil in the Donetsk province of eastern Ukraine.   Ukrainian soldiers had discovered an abandoned zoo in the village when they arrived there in July 2022, five months after the Russian invasion. They found Yampil injured and traumatised after Russian shelling of the zoo. Of nearly 200 animals at the zoo, he was one of seven survivors. Rescuers initially moved him to an animal sanctuary in Belgium before he was permanently rehomed in Scotland. Romain Pizzi, a specialist vet at Five Sisters Zoo, said Yampil had been ""comfortable and happy"" at the West Lothian zoo. However, he said animals that had been rescued from such ""traumatic circumstances"" could have ""complicated health problems such as dental problems or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."" He said: ""Yampil was anaesthetised for further treatment for his health problems which were worrying the team. ""Sadly, anaesthetising animals always carries risks, and Yampil did not recover from the procedure."" The bear was being observed for signs of PTSD when he arrived at the zoo after being concussed by shellfire in the warzone. The vet said staff at the zoo were all ""deeply affected by the loss of our beloved Yampil"". He added: ""We appreciate this will be a truly sad day for all the incredible people who helped make his rescue possible. ""While the zoo will remain open as usual, we kindly request respect and privacy for our owners and staff during this difficult time."" The Asiatic black bear - also known as moon bears because of crescent-shaped yellow fur on their chests - are classed as a vulnerable species by conservation groups, with estimates suggesting there are fewer than 60,000 of them left in the world. They are medium-sized bears averaging 4.5 - 5.4ft (137-165cm) in height, and weighing 90-115kg. The males are often heavier and can weigh up to 181kg.",2024-07-13 23:09:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728zyw0x47o,Unknown,2024-07-13 15:09:11,
344,Prince William to attend Euro 2024 final in Berlin,"The Prince of Wales will attend the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday to watch England play Spain, Kensington Palace has confirmed. He will be joined by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as the England men's team aim to secure their first major trophy in 58 years. Prince William is president of the Football Association (FA), and attended England's victory over Switzerland in the quarter-final and the group stage match against Denmark. After the semi-final win over the Netherlands on Wednesday, Aston Villa fan Prince William congratulated the team in a post on X, saying: ""What a beauty, Ollie!"" Substitute Ollie Watkins secured victory with a last-minute strike which spared England from entering extra time. The prince's father the King also congratulated the Three Lions on their victory in the semi-final and sent his ""best wishes"" for the match on Sunday. He added: ""If I may encourage you to secure victory before the need for any last minute wonder-goals or another penalties drama, I am sure the stresses on the nation’s collective heart rate and blood pressure would be greatly alleviated!""  The Prince of Wales took his eldest son Prince George to the final of the delayed Euros in 2021 at Wembley, when England lost on penalties to Italy. Prince William attended the Lionesses win against Germany in the Women's Euro 2022 and awarded the players their medals. Earlier in the tournament, the prince described the win against Slovakia as an ""emotional rollercoaster"" and the victory against Switzerland as ""nail-biting to the very end"". The men's team has not won a major tournament since the World Cup in 1966 and has never won the European Championship. Thousands of England fans are expected to be in Berlin on Sunday, with the match at the Olympiastadion kicking off at 20:00 BST. Asked about a potential bank holiday if England win, Sir Keir said ""we should certainly mark the occasion"" but stopped short of confirming a day off for the country, saying he did not want to ""jinx it"". Some businesses have already said they will be making changes to their opening times on Sunday and Monday because of the match. Sainsbury's has said its local shops and petrol stations in England will close early at 19:30 BST, and Lidl said it will open its stores an hour later on Monday. Before the semi-final win on Wednesday, Tesco said it would close 1,800 of its Express stores early at 19:30 BST on Sunday if England made it to the final. A surge in beer, burger, and pizza sales is expected, and pubs and shops are competing for customers who will watch the match either at home or at a bar. Music festival Wireless has announced it will end early at 19:00 BST on Sunday to give fans ""plenty of time to travel home"" to watch the game.",2024-07-13 23:09:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5ypd3v7ngo,"Hollie Cole,",2024-07-12 23:09:11,
345,Normal People star: I'd like to revisit role,"Daisy Edgar-Jones, who starred as Marianne in hit TV series Normal People, has said she would like to revisit the role in the future. ""I love those characters,"" the British actress, 26, tells BBC News. ""It would be wonderful to explore them again."" Based on Sally Rooney's novel, the BBC Three drama charted the on-off relationship of teenagers Marianne and Connell, played by Paul Mescal. Released in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic, it propelled its young leads to fame. Both are now starring in major new films, Edgar-Jones in Twisters and Mescal in Gladiator II. ""Normal People was a series that was such a lockdown phenomenon,"" Edgar-Jones says. ""I think it introduced Paul and I to a lot of people and film-makers,"" she says, adding that she felt ""really lucky"" for the opportunities it opened up. I meet Edgar-Jones in a central London hotel, where she is doing press interviews for her new film. This round of promotion is very different from her experience during the pandemic, when she was ""on Zoom for months on end"". ""I haven't done that many in-person interviews yet,"" she says. ""It's so nice."" Since Normal People, Edgar-Jones has starred in films like Fresh and Where the Crawdads Sing, true crime mini-series Under the Banner of Heaven, and now Twisters. For a lot of fans, she remains firmly in their minds as the smart and unafraid schoolgirl Marianne, whose relationship with Connell transfixed viewers. A few months ago, Edgar-Jones and Mescal almost broke the internet with an Instagram post that appeared to tease a Normal People sequel. The pair later clarified that, in fact, they were reuniting to host a marathon screening of Normal People for charity. But Edgar-Jones indicates that she hasn't shut the door on it yet. ""If [Rooney] is up for writing a new story, who knows,"" she says. So is she open to the idea? She laughs. ""Keeping it open. Always open."" Having shot to prominence during Covid, Edgar-Jones says fame is only now ""starting to feel real"". ""I can't believe I'm in a film of this scale,"" she says of Twisters. ""It's definitely a pinch yourself moment."" In the film, a sequel to 1996 blockbuster Twister, Edgar-Jones plays Katie Cooper, a retired storm chaser who returns to the open plains in central Oklahoma to test a new tracking system. Edgar-Jones notes that Cooper, who is haunted by a tragic past encounter with a tornado, bears similarities to other characters she has played. ""I think my characters tend to be, and have been historically, quite introspective. Or characters who have a complex inner life, who are dealing with things that are heavy and emotional,"" she says. She relates to those roles, but adds that she has ""a bit more craic"" than her characters. ""I think maybe I'm more light-hearted. I'm quite silly."" That said, this film did allow her to have some fun, including running and screaming across fields. ""I did do a lot of running. Which isn't my strong suit,"" she says. ""I've actually got a bit of a weird run, which I've been told, so I actually just tried to practice not looking like an eejit as I was running. That was the main thing."" She also ate a lot of Oklahoma cuisine on set, possibly offsetting all the exercise she was getting. ""I had something called chicken fried steak, which I'd never had, which is steak - actual steak - which they fry in chicken batter, which was cool"". Edgar-Jones stars opposite US actor Glen Powell as Tyler Owens, a social media superstar who shamelessly chases tornadoes for likes. Powell, who has also starred in Top Gun: Maverick, Anyone But You and Hit Man, is seen by many as Hollywood's latest heartthrob. ""I feel like I have a habit of starring with a lot of the men of the moment,"" Edgar-Jones says. ""I've worked with a lot of really brilliant actors who have buzz around them too,"" she says. She describes Powell as ""magical"", and adds that Mescal is ""one of my all time best friends"". The Normal People co-stars were recently seen together at Glastonbury festival, in pictures posted on social media. ""We had the best time. Glastonbury is maybe one of my favourite places on Earth when the festival's on,"" Edgar-Jones says. ""It's so much fun. I love dancing, I love being with all my friends, I love camping, I love it all. So yeah. We had such a blast."" Twisters has received mixed reviews from critics. The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded it four stars, praising it as a ""comfortingly old school affair"" and calling its leads ""charismatic"". Meanwhile, writing in Variety, Owen Gleiberman described it as ""less awesome than the original"". The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave it three stars, calling it a ""fun film with some big set-piece scenes"" but adding it was ""weirdly coy"" about mentioning climate change. Edgar-Jones, for her part, says climate change was definitely a theme in the film. ""There's an element of climate change and what that means for how tornado alley is expanding and how more frequently we're getting extreme weather events,"" she says. ""And I think the film really touches on that in a way that it's encouraging you to be aware of it and think about how we can be more concerned about how we look after our planet."" And while comparisons with the first film are inevitable, Edgar-Jones says the new version brings something different. ""Its so fun to see what the new technology will bring to this film,"" she says. Many of us also remain fascinated with films about the dark side of nature. Edgar-Jones counts herself among that camp. ""I'm fascinated by extreme weather,"" she says. ""I think growing up in London I'm used to pretty average mizzle, or miserable drizzle, as I call it. So when I was filming in Oklahoma during tornado season, and I saw really extreme storms, it was incredible. ""It's amazing how massive they are and how small they make you feel.""

341,Alec Baldwin's Rust trial dismissed over hidden evidence,"Alec Baldwin broke down in tears as a New Mexico judge dismissed the involuntary manslaughter case against him for a fatal shooting on the set of the film Rust.  The trial collapsed three days into Baldwin's trial in Santa Fe, at a court just miles from where Halyna Hutchins, a cinematographer, was shot with a revolver that Mr Baldwin was using in rehearsals.  It is the second time the case against the actor has been dismissed since the October 2021 shooting. He will not be tried again. ""There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now,"" Mr Baldwin wrote on Instagram on Saturday. ""To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family."" His lawyers alleged police and prosecutors hid evidence - a batch of bullets - that could have been connected to the shooting.  A key aspect of the case has been how live ammunition ended up on the set and Mr Baldwin’s lawyers have questioned the investigation and mistakes made by authorities who processed the scene.  Their motion to dismiss sparked a remarkable set of events, with one of the two special prosecutors leading the case resigning, and Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissing the jury to hear from multiple witnesses.  The bullets, Mr Baldwin's lawyer said, could be related to Ms Hutchins' death, but were filed in a different case with a different number.  Prosecutors argued the ammunition was not connected to the case and did not match bullets found on the Rust set. The judge ruled, however, that they should have been shared with Mr Baldwin's defence team regardless.  ""The state's wilful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,"" she said from the bench. ""There is no way for the court to right this wrong."" Prosecutors will not be able to lodge the charge against Baldwin again, as the judge did not rule the case a mistrial, but instead outright dismissed it with prejudice.  ""It was the nuclear option. The case is over,"" Los Angeles trial attorney Joshua Ritter told the BBC. Mr Baldwin, best known for his role on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for portraying Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live, wept as the judge read from a lengthy statement detailing her reasons for the dismissal. His wife, Hilaria, covered her mouth. Other members of his family cried and smiled. The actor hugged his lawyers then embraced his wife, who was seated behind him. They walked out hand-in-hand through a tunnel of press into a black vehicle without answering any questions or making any comments.  The evidence came to light on Thursday, when a crime-scene technician told the court that a man named Troy Teske, a retired police officer, had turned over live ammunition that could be related to the case.  Mr Teske is friends with the step-father of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year.  He was working with Seth Kenney, who helped with props and ammunition on the film set. After the judge sent the jury home on Friday, the court heard from a series of witnesses about the bullets, including authorities who led the case and Mr Kenney.  Towards the end of the hearing, one of the prosecutors leading the case - Kari Morrissey - took the stand to testify about the bullets and why they weren't shared with the defence. It's remarkably rare for a prosecutor to testify in a case they bring about their role in the investigation.  Ms Morrissey testified the ammunition had “no evidentiary value” from her perspective. While on the stand, she said that her co-prosecutor, Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, resigned on Friday as the judge weighed to dismiss the case.  She explained Ms Johnson ""didn't agree with the decision to have a public hearing"" over the evidence claims.

343,We're the Wimbledon ball girls who took on the pros,"Have you ever wanted to attend a huge event in person? Maybe you'd love to go to the Euros, or to see your favourite band. But while it's fun to imagine being part of the crowd, two teenagers from Surrey have taken that idea to the next level by playing tennis against some pros on court at Wimbledon. Aashny and Saran were working as ball girls at the time. In a clip posted by the official Wimbledon social accounts, the girls can be seen facing Britain's Jamie Delgado and Juan Sebastián Cabal from Colombia. Saran and Aashny have spoken to BBC Newsbeat about how they went from playing a supporting role to becoming part of the main event. The girls were working as ball girls during the Gentleman's Invitational Doubles games at the time. The event features former professional tennis players and is less competitive than the ladies' and men's singles. ""They don't take it too seriously,"" says Aashny. ""They like to have a joke about."" ""They just turned round to us and were like, 'Do you wanna play?' And of course the friends had to say yes. The pair spent about five minutes swapping lobs with the pro players, with the crowd cheering every time they struck the ball. The Wimbledon Championships, established in 1877, is the oldest tennis competition in the world. Held in south-west London every summer, more than 500,000 people attend each year, according to organisers. Aashny and Saran, both 15, went through multiple stages to become ball girls. They told BBC Newsbeat they were made aware of the opportunity when starting at their secondary school, which is partnered with Wimbledon. ""I've wanted to do this since I was in Year 7,"" says Aashny. Many local schools have a connection with the tennis tournament and students can put themselves forward for the role of ball girl or ball boy. When entering Year 10 in September 2023, they jumped at the chance. ""We started training and each week certain people would get through to the next round,"" says Aashny. Then they got picked for the Wimbledon trial, where more people were eliminated. ""It's a long selection process,"" she says. Saran says the training is pretty tough. ""I was always really nervous to go in,"" she says. ""But I think the work has paid off."" Aashny's been a huge tennis fan her whole life and tells us she loves seeing the players close-up. ""The first time I went onto Centre Court was really special,"" says Aashny. ""I get to see loads of players and be around this atmosphere for two weeks."" But Saran's a different story. ""I have no idea who they are,"" she says. Although she went to Wimbledon with her dad a few years ago, she has to ask Aashny any tennis-related questions when they're working. Source: Wimbledon Aashny said she felt lucky to be so close to the action, and if she hadn't been selected would only have been able to attend one or two matches. Both friends agree, though, that being ball girls has been one of the best experiences of their lives. Catch the women‘s and men’s finals of Wimbledon on the BBC this weekend.

""I don't have any words right now, it's just unbelievable,"" the Czech said, to cheers from the crowd. Asked what it means to the Czech Republic to have another Wimbledon champion, she said: ""Well, I think nobody believes it that I got to the final and nobody believes that I won Wimbledon. ""I still can't believe it."" Krejcikova arrived at SW19 having won just three matches in five months, the result of a season plagued by injury and illness. She leaves it as the Wimbledon champion, winning through seven matches in a row and closing it out with a thrilling 6-2 2-6 6-4 victory against seventh seed Jasmine Paolini. The tournament began for Krejcikova with a tough three-set win over Veronika Kudermetova - a pair of tie-breaks followed by a 7-5 decider. From somewhere, Krejcikova found the game that made the unbelievable dream a reality. ""Two weeks ago I had a very tough match, and I wasn't in good shape before that because I was injured and ill,"" she said. ""I didn't really have a good beginning to the season. It's unbelievable I'm stood here now and I've won Wimbledon. ""I have no idea [how it happened].""

When she was aged 18, Krejcikova and her parents visited Novotna's home and asked for her help. Novotna agreed, becoming both coach and mentor. She and Krejcikova remained close until Novotna's death from ovarian cancer in 2017 aged just 49. ""That day, knocking on her door, it changed my life,"" Krejcikova said in her on-court interview. ""She was the one who told me I had the potential and I should definitely turn pro. Before she passed away she told me I can win a Slam. ""I achieved that in Paris in 2021 and it was an unbelievable moment for me and I never really dreamed I would win the same trophy as Jana did in 1998."" The 28-year-old shuns hotels when she arrives at Wimbledon, preferring the ""relaxed atmosphere"" of the house where Novotna used to reside during the Championships. The pair's names are now both etched on the women's champions board at Wimbledon - a sight that brought Krejcikova to tears as she stood there with the trophy afterwards. ""I think she would be proud,"" Krejcikova said. ""I think she would be really excited that I'm on a same board as she is because Wimbledon was super special for her."" This video can not be played Barbora Krejcikova pays tribute to inspiration Jana Novotna after win For Krejcikova, winning Wimbledon was not the childhood dream. Instead it was French Open glory she was after - a goal she wrote in a notebook when she was 12 years old. ""Maybe things shifted a little bit when I actually met Jana and when she was telling me all the stories about Wimbledon, about the grass, how difficult it was for her to win the title and how emotional she was when she actually made it,"" Krejcikova said. ""Since then I started to see Wimbledon like the biggest tournament in the world."" Paolini had never won a tour-level match on grass before June For Paolini, it was a second Grand Slam singles final defeat in the space of five weeks after losing heavily to Iga Swiatek in the French Open showpiece. In both Paris and Wimbledon, the 5ft 4in Italian became an instant fan favourite with her bubbly personality and never-say-die attitude. But sheer determination and doggedness were not enough to stop Swiatek or Krejcikova when it mattered. ""I think I did better than the last final, but still not enough,"" Paolini said in her news conference. She will become the world number five when the latest rankings are released, becoming the first Italian woman to feature in the top five since Sara Errani in 2013. However, when asked what the next step in her great rise would be, Paolini was stuck for words. ""I don't know,"" she said. ""Sometimes I'm a little bit scared to dream too much. I have to say that.

348,'Pure elation' for Ireland after 'moment of genius' in South Africa,"Ciaran Frawley's last-gasp drop goal gave Ireland a dramatic win in Durban ""Just keep believing, there's still time."" That was the message from Ireland captain Caelan Doris to his team-mates in the closing stages against South Africa.  After a stunning first half from Ireland in Durban, the hosts hit back to lead by two points as the clock ticked towards 80 minutes. Doris' message certainly seemed unlikely when Ireland had a scrum on their own 22-metre line with 90 seconds remaining.  But up stepped Ciaran Frawley.  After winning the scrum, something Ireland had struggled with all evening, the replacement fly-half sent a perfect kick into Springbok territory and the onrushing Irish pack forced Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu into touch.  From the resulting line-out - another area Ireland had been below par - the ball was carried into contact and Frawley moved into position. Once the ball came back to him there was only ever going to be one result.  Just as he had earlier in the game, on just his sixth cap, his long-range drop goal flew between the posts - this time to spark wild celebrations as Ireland won 25-24. ""It's pure elation seeing the ball sail over at the end there,"" Doris told Sky Sports. ""It was back and forth, there was two points in it. We believed if we got down there and got territory then we could score."" Late Frawley drop-goal gives Irish thrilling win over South Africa Ireland need to build on SA win next year  - Frawley South Africa 24-25 Ireland - Last-kick Ciaran Frawley drop-goal beats world champions - as it happened Doris' sentiment was something former Ireland wing Shane Horgan agreed with.  In fact, on Sky Sports, he went as far as saying: ""I don't think any other Irish team in history has quite had that.""  Rory Best felt South Africa's similar mentality meant the rivalry between the sides would only grow.  ""They put themselves in the perfect place to win and it took a moment of genius from Ireland to snatch it from them,"" remarked the former Ireland skipper. South Africa were well worth their victory in Pretoria the previous week, but in the in the build-up to the second Test, Irish head coach Andy Farrell said his side do not tend to lose two on the bounce. That looked to be somewhat prophetic when Conor Murray's try and three Jack Crowley penalties gave Ireland a 10-point lead at half-time. But South Africa are back-to-back world champions for a reason as they responded superbly in the second of the two-match series.  They overawed Ireland at the start of the second half and, through the boot of the perfect Handre Pollard with eight penalties, the 10-point deficit became a two-point lead.  ""South Africa don't lose easy, they find a way. It's so frustrating at times to play against,"" Murray added.  ""We believed in ourselves coming into South Africa's backyard. It was always going to be a big challenge."" Murray, with 118 caps of experience, said the defeat the previous week had ""hurt the players"".  The Test match was the final game of a 13-month season, that started last August with dreams of winning the World Cup.  For Ireland those dreams would remain unfulfilled as South Africa retained the trophy. There wasn't any silverware up for grabs on Saturday, but Murray said the squad knew they had to put everything on the line for one final push. ""I think we can be really proud,"" he added. ""We had a really honest meeting on Wednesday about ourselves.  ""We knew we were getting a break at the end of the week and the boys fronted up and committed to this week.""  Conor Murray's first-half try had put Ireland in control before South Africa's comeback The rivalry with South Africa has stewed and brewed since Ireland's narrow win over them in Dublin in November 2022.  While they had bragging rights in the World Cup pool stages, it was the Springboks who had the last laugh as they lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Paris.  The match in Durban was the latest chapter between the two best sides in the world. The South African players and media, in particular, were keen to stoke the flames ahead of the Tests, but ultimately it was two breathless, brutal and brilliant sets of 80 minutes that will define the series. Murray said the rivalry between the two rugby heavyweights it is ""good for the game"". ""There is huge respect there, we have huge respect for them and it's an honour to be able to go toe-to-toe with them,"" he added. ""The nerves for me, and I'm sure a lot of lads would agree, were a lot this week but it's nice when it pays off.  ""You have to celebrate it. These are rare times and it's such a tough thing to do.""",2024-07-13 23:09:12,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cw4y3zkvwe1o,Andy Gray,2024-07-13 21:09:12,

In the following news conference, he added: ""It's completely surreal. My dad came up to me and said 'That was like a bank robbery', which is harsh but fair. ""It seemed like we were always down. First set tie-break, 6-1 down, clawed back, lost. Second set tie-break 5-2 down, lucky net cord, pretty good return, but pretty lucky, clawed it back. ""Mini-breaks down in the third-set tie-break. Didn't get near to their serves all match. Yeah, blew open the doors and ran away with the trophy at the end of it."" Heliovaara added: ""We were a little lucky, but sometimes you need luck to win a tennis match. We will definitely enjoy it. The tears you see, it's all very emotional."" Thompson, who lost to American Brandon Nakashima in the second round of the men's singles, summed up the beaten pair's thoughts by saying: ""I'm devastated. We were so close."" Purcell was aiming for his second Wimbledon success after he and fellow Australian Matthew Ebden won the doubles in 2022. Assessing his latest final appearance, Purcell said: ""It was a great match for the crowd. I'm super happy for the boys, they deserved it. ""You don't know how many times you will be here so enjoy it, all the best."" This video can not be played Henry Patten's 'great' reflex shot against Purcell & Thompson Patten and Heliovaara saved five set points in a thrilling first-set tie-break and had a chance of their own at 7-6, only for the Australians to win three successive points to move ahead in the match. But Patten and Heliovaara, with the majority of the crowd cheering loudly at every success, fought hard and held off the first of the match points in the 12th game of the second set. They also then saved two further match points in the tie-break, fighting back from 7-6 and 8-7 behind to take it 10-8 and force a deciding set. Neither pair could break serve as a 10-point tie-break to settle the match always seemed inevitable. Purcell and Thompson led 8-6, but Patten and Heliovaara won five of the next six points to seal an incredible victory, one which was marked by a near-deafening roar from a delighted Centre Court audience. For Patten, there is a remarkable story behind his title success. Eight years ago, aged 20, he was on the outside courts at Wimbledon working for IBM and collecting match statistics. Before this year, his only previous attempt in the men's doubles ended with a loss in the first round in 2022. The 6ft 6in left-hander, who was born in Colchester and went to school in Ipswich, has a booming serve and a blistering forehand that produced one scorching winner to go 5-4 up in the 10-point tie-break. This was by far the biggest match of his career and he delivered with great shots as well as being an imposing figure at the net. Patten has now become only the third British player since 1936 - after Jonathan Marray in 2012 and Skupski last year - to have been a part of winning men's doubles teams at Wimbledon. Along with sharing £650,000 in prize money with Heliovaara, Patten can say he has made his own everlasting mark on the sport's statistics.

They also took a tie-break route to victory against Canadian Gabriela Dabrowski and New Zealander Erin Routliffe, winning 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-1) in a match that finished at 22:22 BST. A double fault from Routliffe brought the match to an end, with a delighted Siniakova and Townsend embracing.

350,China rocked by cooking oil contamination scandal,"The Chinese government says it will investigate allegations that fuel tankers have been used to transport cooking oil after carrying toxic chemicals without being cleaned properly between loads. The controversy has spread online as social media users express concerns about potential food contamination. Tankers used for transporting fuel were found to be carrying food products, like cooking oil and syrup, and were not decontaminated correctly, according to state-run Beijing News. Transporting cooking oil in contaminated fuel trucks was said to have been so widespread it was considered an “open secret” in the industry, according to one driver quoted by the newspaper. The case is the latest blow to public trust in the Chinese government's ability to enforce food safety standards. The controversy has been the top trending topic on Chinese social media in recent days. On Weibo - the country’s equivalent to X, formerly known as Twitter - there have been  tens of thousands of posts about the scandal, which have racked up millions of views. “Food safety is the most important issue,” a comment liked more than 8,000 times said. Another comment said: “As an ordinary person, surviving in this world itself is an amazing thing already.” Many compared it to the 2008 Sanlu milk scandal, in which some 300,000 children became sick and at least six died after drinking powdered milk contaminated with high levels of the industrial chemical melamine. “This is much worse than the Sanlu scandal, it can’t be settled with just [a] statement,” a user commented.  In China, tankers are not limited to any particular type of goods so can, in theory, carry food products straight after transporting coal-based oils. The claims involve several major Chinese companies including a subsidiary of state-owned Sinograin and the Hopefull Grain and Oil Group. Sinograin has said it is investigating whether food safety regulations were being followed correctly. The company also said it will immediately suspend the use of any trucks that are found to have fallen foul of the the rules. A Hopefull Grain representative told government-controlled newspaper Global Times that it was conducting a ""thorough self-inspection"". The Chinese government has said food safety officials will carry out the investigation into the allegations. They have promised to punish any companies and individuals involved in wrongdoing. They have also vowed to immediately publish the findings of their investigation. ""Illegal enterprises and relevant responsible persons will be severely punished in accordance with the law and will not be tolerated,"" state broadcaster CCTV said. At the local level, both the Hebei and Tianjin provincial governments have said they are also looking into the matter.

351,'Southgate inherited a shambles but now stands one game from greatness',"England manager Gareth Southgate is one game away from history before the Euro 2024 final against Spain England enter the iconic surroundings of Berlin’s Olympiastadion on Sunday night with a place in history the prize that would accompany victory in the Euro 2024 final against Spain. Gareth Southgate’s side must overcome the most impressive side on show in Germany to end a 58-year search for success by the men’s team stretching back to the sunlit day on 30 July 1966 when Sir Alf Ramsey’s side won the World Cup. A total of 457 players have represented England since that day - with 436 debutants - and the country has qualified for 20 major tournaments under 11 managers without ever escaping the storyline of disappointment. Southgate and his players now have the chance to change the narrative forever and there has been a genuine sense of history in the making as England supporters flooded into Berlin, with many making their way to the vast bowl to the west of the city more than 24 hours before kick-off. England, under Southgate, are in a second successive European Championship final and hoping to erase the bitter memories of their defeat on penalties by Italy at Euro 2020. That was a desperate occasion on every level, not simply because of the loss, but also because England’s hope of emerging from the post-Covid era with a landmark victory was overshadowed by events away from the game. What could have been a joyous day was scarred by crowd violence, poor organisation, mass disorder at Wembley as well as in London, then the bleak shadow of racist abuse aimed in the direction of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after they missed in the penalty shootout. Emotions are in sharp contrast as Euro 2024 draws to its conclusion. There is a rediscovered sense of purpose and unity about Southgate’s squad. The fractures with fans, seen in the beer cups and abuse aimed at the manager and players after the draw with Slovenia, have healed. Yet no senior England football team has won a final on foreign soil. Is this finally the time? Why Mainoo has 'wow factor' - and could be one of the greats The youth clubs where England's Euro stars flourished Penalties, red cards and shocks - England's 58 years of hurt Wayne Rooney's broken foot sabotaged England's hopes of winning Euro 2004 England may be second favourites but the past few days have seen the emergence of a “name on the trophy” feeling of destiny, that the time may have finally arrived when a fresh story of success can be told. As Southgate, relaxed and smiling on his final media appearance before the match, said: ""We have a fabulous opportunity that we set out to achieve from the moment we left [the 2022 World Cup in] Qatar a bit earlier than we would have liked to. ""I'm not a believer in fairytales but I believe in dreams and we have big dreams. If we are not afraid of losing it gives us a better chance to win and I want the players to feel that fearlessness."" Those of us chronicling the years of disappointment have witnessed all manner of reasons why England have had their noses pressed up against the window while other countries, most notably huge underdogs Greece at Euro 2004, have enjoyed success that has agonisingly eluded them. In major tournament terms, past history makes the Southgate years seem like a golden era, with a World Cup semi-final, the Euro 2020 final, a World Cup quarter-final, and now this final against Spain on his CV. It is all a far cry from what went before under his predecessors, when high hopes were dashed as England specialised in falling short. England visibly wilted in the stifling heat of Shizuoka on the south coast of Japan when losing the World Cup quarter-final to Brazil in 2002, not helped by manager Sven-Goran Eriksson continuing to select David Beckham when clearly not fully fit - a pattern he would repeat with similar results. The Euros in Portugal two years later was a tale of missed opportunity, ill-luck and “Roomania”, as the 18-year-old Everton phenomenon Wayne Rooney took the global stage by storm. Rooney’s blockbuster display in the opening defeat to France was followed by two-goal performances in wins against Switzerland and Croatia transforming the silent street footballer - no interviews allowed - into a worldwide story. Hotel bedroom phones would ring in the middle of night with outlets from around the world demanding any piece of precious information about the new young superstar. Having attended the same school as Rooney, De La Salle in Liverpool’s Croxteth district, became both a blessing and a curse for me. Sadly it ended in more quarter-final disappointment, Rooney’s broken foot early in the game against hosts Portugal with England leading changed the course of their tournament. England had a team groaning under the weight of world-class talent but the penalty curse struck again, as did Eriksson’s inability to fashion a balanced midfield out of Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes. England or Spain? Sutton's Euro 2024 final prediction 'Why England's story can have a different ending this time' Shops, John Bishop & darts - what is changing because of Euros final? Ezri Konsa, Jude Bellingham and late match-winner Ollie Watkins celebrate the quarter-final win against the Netherlands The tournament in Germany two years later was the World Cup of WAGs, those of us based in the beautiful spa town of Baden-Baden often unable to move around for crowds of photographers and the public making it all an unseemly circus, with Ashley Cole’s then wife Cheryl, Victoria Beckham and Colleen Rooney garnering as many, if not more, headlines as England’s performances. In another Eriksson Groundhog Day, England went out on penalties to Portugal. A frustrated and not match-fit Rooney - who arrived at the team base having been declared fit after another foot injury with the words ""the big man is back in town"" - was sent off for stamping on defender Ricardo Carvalho then sent on his way with Cristiano Ronaldo’s infamous wink. But if measured by unrelenting misery, the 2010 World Cup in South Africa may well be the winner. Fabio Capello lead a campaign that mirrored his countenance - grim, austere and discontented, the Italian choosing to base England in a gilded cage at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace outside Rustenburg. Isolated in the extreme, the monastic strategy inside “Camp Capello” failed in every respect, from Rio Ferdinand’s serious knee injury on the first day of training to the undignified sight of England’s manager bellowing at a photographer before a training session in the mistaken belief he was taking unauthorised shots. The unhappiness and boredom blew up in an explosive press conference when John Terry appeared to challenge Capello’s authority, even demanding the inclusion of then Chelsea team-mate Joe Cole, and Rooney admitting the day consisted of “breakfast, training, lunch, bed, dinner, bed” before adding: “There are only so many games of darts and snooker you can play.” Terry’s complaints about the camp were painted as an attempted coup by someone who was no longer captain but whose words carried merit, even if making them public was described as a “big mistake” by Capello. It ended with a 4-1 thrashing against Germany in the last 16, England so poor that even Frank Lampard’s wrongly disallowed goal could not be used as a figleaf to disguise a truly rotten tournament. Whenever the story of Southgate’s time in charge is told, it must be within the context of the extended shambles he inherited from Capello, Roy Hodgson and then the “blink and you’ll miss it” 67-day reign of Sam Allardyce. Harry Kane has his sights on following Sir Bobby Moore as only the second England captain to lift a major trophy for the men's team Hodgson’s time in charge ended minutes after the humiliation of a last-16 exit to Iceland at Euro 2016 in France - an embarrassment so complete that some members of the media who ran from the press box at the final whistle still did not arrive in time to hear his resignation announcement. In the final twist of farce, we watched in disbelief as Hodgson had to be persuaded to appear for a final media briefing, seemingly believing that as he was no longer England manager he was not expected to explain the events surrounding a mind-numbingly bad performance. Hodgson entered a room at England’s base at Chantilly with the words: “I don’t really know what I’m doing here.” After the manner in which England’s campaign was conducted, it was both comedy gold and the perfect epitaph for those few weeks in France. This was, after the brief Allardyce era, the mess Southgate was required to piece together again, explaining why he deserves respect for what he has accomplished, irrespective of Sunday’s outcome. Southgate has given England credibility and respectability, rehabilitating them as a global force. Only the win is missing, but now Southgate's England have the chance to finally end the years of hurt in magnificent, iconic surroundings Victory in Berlin would be Southgate’s crowning achievement, putting him alongside Sir Alf Ramsey in England’s managerial Hall Of Fame, his restoration of the prestige of playing for England not far behind. He has led England to a final many expected them to reach, and win, before the start of the tournament but which has taken a treacherous route forcing them to overcome hazards and some self-inflicted wounds before reaching their intended destination. And so to Berlin’s Olympiastadion, with Southgate and England’s players at the gates of history and a game that could shape legacies and change lives forever.",2024-07-13 23:09:12,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn09240ege7o,Phil McNulty,2024-07-13 22:54:12,
352,China hits back at Nato over Russia accusations,"China's foreign minister Wang Yi has hit back at Nato's ""groundless accusations"" that Beijing is helping Russia in its war on Ukraine. He has also warned the Western alliance against stirring up confrontation. Mr Wang's comments, made in a call with his Dutch counterpart, came hours after leaders of Nato member states gathered in Washington DC and issued a declaration that mentioned the war. They accused China of being a ""decisive enabler"" of Russia through its ""large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base"", in some of their harshest remarks yet about Beijing.  They called on China to stop ""all material and political support"" to Russia's war effort such as the supply of dual-use materials, which are items that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. Western states have previously accused Beijing of transferring drone and missile technology and satellite imagery to Moscow.  The US estimates about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports now come from China. Beijing was also accused of conducting ""malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation"" on Nato states. In a press conference on Thursday, US President Joe Biden said that he had discussions with other leaders about spelling out the consequences for China. ""China has to understand that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, working with North Korea and others to help Russia and [their] armament, that they're not going to benefit economically as a consequence of that,"" he said. ""I think you'll see that some of our European friends are going to be curtailing their investment in China."" Pointing out that Russia had been seeking weapons from China and North Korea, he added that Nato states were looking into a new policy to turn the West into an ""industrial base"" for munitions and to develop new weapons systems. On Thursday, while speaking to the Netherlands' new foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp, Mr Wang said ""China absolutely does not accept"" all these accusations and insisted that they have ""always been a force for peace and force for stability"". In comments carried by state media, he said that China's different political system and values ""should not be used as a reason for Nato to incite confrontation with China"", and called for Nato to ""stay within its bounds"". His remarks was the latest in a flurry of angry responses from Beijing.  Earlier on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Nato was smearing China with ""fabricated disinformation"", while Beijing's mission to the EU told the alliance to ""stop hyping up the so-called China threat"". Beijing has long rebutted accusations that it has been aiding Russia in the war and insists that it remains a neutral party. It has called for an end to the conflict and proposed a peace plan, which Ukraine has rejected. But, besides the growing accusations of military support, observers have also pointed out that Beijing's purchases of vast amounts of oil and gas have helped prop up Russia's economy crippled by sanctions and replenish coffers drained by war spending.  Beijing's official rhetoric on the conflict often mirrors Moscow's - like them, China still does not call it a war. Chinese President Xi Jinping has maintained a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with both of them famously declaring their partnership has ""no limits"". Beijing has accused the US and other Western states of pouring ""fuel on the fire"" by supplying lethal weapons and technology to Ukraine for its defence.  In recent weeks, several countries have gone a step further and allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to hit targets inside Russia.  During Nato's three-day summit, which ended on Thursday, the alliance continued to underscore its commitment to Ukraine. Member states said they would support Ukraine on its ""irreversible path"" to future membership, adding that ""Ukraine's future in Nato"". They also announced further integration with Ukraine's military and support for its defence. The alliance has committed at least €40bn ($43.3bn, £33.7bn) in aid in the next year, including F-16 fighter jets and air defence support.

353,'History on the line' for Djokovic in Alcaraz final,"Novak Djokovic is hoping to avenge his loss to Carlos Alcaraz in last year's Wimbledon final Novak Djokovic says ""history will be on the line"" when he faces Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon men's singles final. Djokovic has the opportunity to equal Roger Federer's record of eight men's Wimbledon titles and secure a record 25th Grand Slam singles triumph with victory on Sunday. The Serb, 37, who had knee surgery three weeks before the start of the tournament, is level with Australian Margaret Court on the all-time list with 24 singles majors. ""Of course, it serves as a great motivation,"" Djokovic said. ""But at the same time there is also a lot of pressure and expectation. ""Wimbledon just extracts the best of me and motivates me to always show up and perform the best I can."" The highly anticipated showdown is a repeat of last year's final which Alcaraz won in five thrilling sets after four hours and 42 minutes. It starts at 14:00 BST and will be live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app. This video can not be played Wimbledon crowd boos as Novak Djokovic performs a violin celebration after his semi-final win Djokovic has not always seen eye to eye with fans at Wimbledon this year, accusing some of the Centre Court crowd of using their bellowing of Holger Rune's name as ""an excuse to boo"" during his fourth-round win. Following the second seed's semi-final victory over Lorenzo Musetti, some fans booed him as he imitated playing a violin - a light-hearted celebration intended for his six-year-old daughter Tara. But he has also shown a lighter side. Given an extra day's rest after quarter-final opponent Alex de Minaur withdrew, he spent it playing tennis with his children on Wimbledon's practice courts. He pretended to take a penalty after his third-round match was momentarily delayed by fans celebrating England's shootout win over Switzerland at the Euros. And he kept up the football banter on Friday by telling reporters he expects Gareth Southgate's side to ""bring it home"". Djokovic has reached 10 Wimbledon finals, two behind Federer's record Djokovic is having - by his lofty standards - a below-par 2024. He has not won a title yet, his worst start to a year since 2006, while Wimbledon will be his first final since the ATP Finals in November. But he has seemingly regained top form at SW19, playing his usual brand of dominant tennis and dropping just two sets in six matches. ""I wasn't sure until three, four days before the tournament whether I'm going to take part,"" added Djokovic who had surgery in June after tearing the medial meniscus in his right knee at the French Open. ""I made an extra effort to recover as quickly as possible just because it was Wimbledon.""

The 21-year-old, now a three-time major champion, could become the youngest back-to-back men's singles winner at Wimbledon since Boris Becker in 1986. This is only Alcaraz's fourth appearance at the Championships.  However, the Spaniard - a crowd favourite wherever he plays - says he is ""not thinking about taking the crown"" off Djokovic as the next tennis superstar. Alcaraz is unbeaten in Grand Slam finals, a feat he admitted he ""thinks about"" but believes will ""be difficult"" to keep up. Five weeks ago he lifted his first French Open title and should he win on Sunday, he would be the youngest man to win at Wimbledon and Roland Garros in the same year. ""Sometimes I feel like I'm 26 or 27 and then I realise that I'm just 21 and everything is coming too fast and too quick,"" Alcaraz told BBC Sport. ""It could be better if I had to wait a little bit, but I've put in the hard work every day and I am glad people get to see me achieve my dreams."" Alcaraz has won two and lost three of his previous matches against Djokovic Alcaraz has had a trickier run to this year's final and narrowly avoided a shock loss to Frances Tiafoe in the third round, eventually winning in five sets. He has dropped a set in each of his three matches since that scare, against seeds Ugo Humbert, Tommy Paul and Daniil Medvedev. The third seed, who has won 13 consecutive matches at Wimbledon, had the support of most of the crowd during last year's final, although he may be pushing his luck by jokingly poking fun at England supporters this week before his nation's Euro 2024 final with the Three Lions. He received gentle boos during an on-court interview following his semi-final win when he said Sunday will be a ""good day for Spanish people"". And asked if the football match - which kicks off at 20:00 BST in Berlin - might be a distraction, Alcaraz said: ""I am going to play first so it's going to be difficult for me. I will try not to think about it and leave everything on the court.""

Hewett came agonisingly close to Wimbledon singles glory in 2022 when he had four opportunities to serve out for the trophy but could not capitalise.

360,Republicans accuse Biden of inciting Trump shooting,"A group of Republican lawmakers are blaming US President Joe Biden, claiming his campaign rhetoric led to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.  As of Sunday, nearly a dozen lawmakers have pointed fingers at Mr Biden and Democrats at-large for the shooting Saturday evening at the former president's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Many are pointing to a comment from Mr Biden while on a private phone call with donors last week.  According to Politico, Biden said on the call: “I have one job, and that’s to beat Donald Trump. I’m absolutely certain I’m the best person to be able to do that. So, we’re done talking about the debate. It’s time to put Trump in a bullseye."" On Saturday, Mr Biden condemned the attack and called on Americans to denounce such violence. On Sunday, he ordered a review of security at the rally. In the aftermath of the assassination attempt, the specific reference to ""Trump in a bullseye"" less than a week before, has led some Republicans to place the burden of the shooting in part on Mr Biden.  ""Joe Biden sent the orders,"" Georgia Republican Rep. Mike Collins posted on X, formerly Twitter, in a response to a post about Mr Biden's comments to donors.  In another post, Mr Collins wrote ""they attempted to neutralize the threat"", responding to a separate graphic featuring the president's comments.  ""Notice that after an attempted assassination of President Trump, the same people who wanted him prosecuted for telling his supporters to peacefully march to the Capitol on January 6 are not calling for President Biden’s prosecution after he said it was time to put President Trump in the bullseye after their debate,"" Collins wrote.  FBI officials identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a kitchen worker from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who is a registered Republican. A Secret Service sniper fatally shot Crooks after he fired at the president.  Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, also referenced Mr Biden's bullseye comment in posts on social media.  ""Just days ago, Biden said 'it's time to put Trump in a bullseye'. Today, there was an assassination attempt against President Trump,"" she wrote on X Saturday evening.  Ms Blackburn also criticized Mr Biden for not releasing a statement for the first hour after the shooting, calling his delay ""unacceptable"". ""Go to the Oval Office and address the American people. We do not settle our differences by violence,"" she said.  Mr Biden spoke Saturday night from his home in Delaware where he was spending the weekend. He condemned the assassination attempt and called on all Americans to denounce such ""sick"" violence. ""We must unite as one nation to condemn it. It's sick, it's sick,"" he said.  Mr Biden then left Delaware to return to the White House, where he addressed the shooting again Sunday afternoon. A national address from the Oval Office is planned for Sunday night. The sitting president also spoke with Trump over the phone on Saturday night in a call that one White House official described as ""good, short and respectful"".  Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee took to social media in response to Mr Biden's bullseye statement, too, asking reporters in a post if they plan to delve into the president's comment to donors.  ""That just happened,"" they wrote in a post after the attempted assassination. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, told 9News on Saturday night that she believes ""much of the rhetoric from the left has escalated to this moment"".  ""President Trump was literally put in a bullseye after the President of the United States, the sitting President of the United States, called for him to be put in a bullseye,"" she said.  When asked if she thinks Biden bears responsibility for the attempted assassination, she replied: ""I do believe that Joe Biden is responsible for the shooting today."" Other Republicans pointed to Democrats' recent efforts to end Trump's Secret Service protection after he became the first president convicted of felony counts for falsifying business records related to hush money payments to an adult film actress.  Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, introduced the legislation in April that several House Democrats co-sponsored.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican who blamed the media and several Democrats for the shooting in posts on X, posted a list on the social media platform of Democrats who co-sponsored the legislation. ""Pray for America. The left wants a civil war. They have been trying to start one for years. These people are sick and evil,"" she wrote.  Sen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican, who is on Trump's short list of vice presidential picks, echoed similar sentiments blaming the left's rhetoric.  ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,"" he wrote on X.  Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Democrats and the media have ""recklessly stoked fears"", and called Trump and conservatives ""threats to democracy"". ""Their inflammatory rhetoric puts lives at risk,"" he also wrote on X.  Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, the House majority leader who was shot at a practice for a congressional baseball game in 2017, said Democrats have fuelled ""ludicrous hysteria"" about Trump being re-elected.  ""Clearly, we’ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop,"" he said.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0y9xljv2yo,"Rachel Looker,",2024-07-14 19:09:46,
359,What we know so far about Trump shooting suspect,"The small Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park in Pennsylvania is reeling after the FBI named a young local man, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as the person who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign rally and shocked the nation. Investigators believe that Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire at the former president while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania, leaving one audience member dead and two others critically wounded.  The 20-year-old kitchen worker was shot dead at the scene by a Secret Service sniper, officials said.  In his quiet and well-to-do hometown, however, neighbours are in shock, seemingly unable to grasp how a quiet young man is now accused in the shooting. The FBI, for its part, has said only that Crooks was the ""subject involved in the assassination attempt on the former president and that an active investigation was under way. Thomas Crooks had not been carrying ID, so investigators used DNA to identify him, the FBI said. He was from Bethel Park in Pennsylvania, about 70km (43 miles) from the site of the attempted assassination, and graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School with a $500 prize for maths and science, according to a local newspaper.  Crooks worked in a local nursing home kitchen just a short drive away from his home, the BBC understands. State voter records show that he was a registered Republican, according to US media. He is also reported to have donated $15 to liberal campaign group ActBlue in 2021. According to US media reports, Crooks was wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a YouTube channel known for its guns and demolition content. The channel has millions of subscribers featuring videos on different guns and explosive devices. Law enforcement officials believe the weapon used to shoot at Donald Trump was purchased by Crook's father, the Associated Press news agency reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity, two officers told AP that Crooks' father bought a weapon at least six months ago.  The day after the shooting, law enforcement sources also told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that suspicious devices were found in Crooks' vehicle. According to CBS, the suspect had a piece of commercially available equipment that appeared capable of initiating the devices.  Bomb technicians were called to the scene to secure and investigate the devices.  Having established Crooks's identity, police and agencies are investigating his motive. ""We do not currently have an identified motive,"" said Kevin Rojek, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, at a briefing on Saturday night. The inquiry into what took place could last for months and investigators would work ""tirelessly"" to identify what Crooks' motive was, Mr Rojek said. Speaking to CNN, Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but would “wait until I talk to law enforcement” before speaking about his son.  Police sealed off the road to the house where Crooks lived with his parents, CBS News reports. A neighbour told CBS that officers evacuated her in the middle of the night with no warning. Bethel Park Police said there was a bomb investigation surrounding Crooks's home. Access to the area remains tightly controlled with police vehicles blocking the roads. Only residents have been allowed in or out.  Law enforcement sources told CBS that they believe some degree of planning ahead of the shooting.  How much time was spent in that planning, however, remains the subject of an ongoing investigation.  Police believe he acted alone, but are continuing to investigate whether he was accompanied to the rally.  So far, a confusing - and at times conflicting - picture has emerged of who Crooks was as a person.  Speaking to local news outlet KDKA, some young locals who went to school with him described him as a loner, who was frequently bullied and sometimes wore ""hunting outfits to school"".  Another former classmate of his, Summer Barkley, cast him differently, telling the BBC that he was ""always getting good grades on tests"" and was ""very passionate about history"".  ""Anything on government and history he seemed to know about,"" he said. ""But it was nothing out of the ordinary....he was always nice.""  Others simply remembered him as quiet.  ""He was there but I can't think of anyone who knew him well,"" one former classmate, who asked to remain nameless, told the BBC. ""He's just not a guy I really think about. But he seemed fine. Jameson Myers, a former member of the Bethel Park High School varsity rifle team who graduated alongside Crooks in 2022, told CBS that he did not make the team.  ""He did not even make the junior varsity team after trying out,"" Mr Myers added. ""He never returned to try-outs for the remainder of high school.""  Mr Myers remembers Crooks as seemingly a ""normal boy"" who was ""not particularly popular but never got picked on or anything.""  “He was a nice kid who never talked poorly of anyone and I never have thought him capable of anything I’ve seen him do in the last few days.”  A shooting club in the Pittsburgh area, the Clairton Sportmen's Club, later confirmed that Crooks was a member, although club president Bill Sellitto did not provide any more details.  Other community members said simply that they were shocked that the alleged perpetrator of the shooting could have come from the quiet, green streets of Bethel Park.  Among them was Jason Mackey, a 27-year-old local man who lives near the Crooks residence and worked at his school while he was a student.  While Mr Mackey said that he did not know Crooks personally, he is still reeling from a sense of disbelief.  ""It's just shocking. You wouldn't think an event of this magnitude would come right out of your backyard,"" he said. ""It's just a crazy situation."" One person was killed and two others were injured in the shooting.  All three victims are adult men and were audience members, CBS News reports.  At a news conference on Sunday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro identified the deceased victim at Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief who was killed when he ""dived on his family"" to protect them. He said that Comperatore ""died a hero"".  A GoFundMe page, organised by the Trump campaign's national finance director Meredith O'Rourke, was set up in the hours after the attack with donations going to the families of the injured. It has so far raised more than $340,000 (£267,000). In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear"" and said he felt the bullet ""ripping through the skin"". Blood was visible on Trump's ear and face as protection officers rushed him away. Trump is ""doing well"" and is grateful to law enforcement officers, according to a statement published on the Republican National Committee (RNC) website. One witness told the BBC that he had seen a man – believed to be Crooks - with a rifle on the roof of a building before Trump was shot.  Video footage obtained by TMZ shows the moment the shooting began. The assailant opened fire with “an AR-style rifle”, CBS News reports.  Law enforcement sources also told CBS that he was reported by a bystander and identified as a suspicious person by police, but that officers lost track of him before the shooting began.  However, the FBI says it did not immediately know what type of firearm was used or how many shots were fired. A Secret Service sniper returned fire and killed the gunman, the agency said. Footage later shows armed officers approaching a body on the roof of the building.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gw58wv4e9o,"Bernd Debusmann, Tom Bateman and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-14 19:09:46,
358,Secret Service has questions to answer for failing to stop Trump gunman,"The US Secret Service has one primary job - to protect current and former US presidents – and in that they failed spectacularly when an attempt was made on Donald Trump’s life on Saturday. It has been 43 years since the last assassination attempt on a former or present US president, when Ronald Reagan was shot in the lung but survived. Today, American politicians and the public want to know how a would-be assassin was able to crawl onto a rooftop vantage point, armed with a rifle, and let off four shots towards the podium - all in an area that was supposed to have been cleared. Why were warnings from the public apparently ignored or not acted upon?  And why, when a highly charged presidential election is just four months away, did the Secret Service not do a better job of protecting the man many believe will be America’s next president? The investigation that is already under way involves the FBI as well as the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before a committee of the US House of Representatives on 22 July. Those who attended the rally itself were asked to pass through metal detectors to ensure they were not bringing any weapons, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. But the gunman believed to have fired the shots could clearly be seen crawling around with a rifle on top of a nearby building for several minutes, one eyewitness told the BBC. The witness, who called himself Greg, said warnings that he and others gave were not acted upon by police, who he suggested did not know “what was going on” and had poor visibility of the rooftop. The suspected gunman - who has been named by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - also appears to have been caught on camera lining up his shot, in footage obtained by TMZ. One spectator was killed and two others critically injured before the gunman was himself shot dead. Trump was also injured in the ear. State police have said it is “too early” to determine exactly what happened. Trump’s life might have been saved by the fact he ducked after the first shots were fired, said David Dunn, a professor of international politics from the University of Birmingham. In that respect, he “clearly had been well trained by the Secret Service”, Prof Dunn told BBC Radio 5 Live. Before being whisked away in a car by agents, Trump rose again to pump his fist before the crowd. Greg said he was left wondering why agents were not deployed on all the nearby rooftops, and did not intervene to take Trump off stage after he raised the alarm. Former Secret Service agent Charles Marino agreed that there were questions to answer. He told the BBC it would have been among the agents’ tasks to survey the surroundings and note “concerning areas”. Experts who spoke to NBC said events such as political rallies always brought challenges in securing a wide expanse of land. One of them, former Secret Service agent Evy Poumpouras, said there would always be lingering questions: “How do you secure that outer perimeter? How far do you go? And can you cover everything? That’s a problem.” Analysis from BBC Verify suggests that Crooks was able to get a little more than 130m (430ft) from Trump’s position behind the lectern. It was announced late on Saturday that the FBI had assumed the role of lead investigator into the incident, which it describes as an assassination attempt. One of its special agents said at a news conference it was “surprising” that the gunman had been able to open fire before the Secret Service killed him. But when asked if there was a failure of security, he said his team was ""not gonna make that assessment"" while the investigation continued. The Secret Service was not represented at the briefing. An earlier statement confirming the start of the investigation promised more information would be released when available. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said maintaining the security of presidential candidates was one of the departments “most vital priorities”. It is not clear what the attack will mean for the former president's future security arrangements, though an adviser to the Trump campaign said it was clear he needed more protection.  A Secret Service spokesman has denied an ""untrue assertion"" that it was asked by Trump's team for extra resources, but rebuffed this request. In any case, Trump was now likely to receive a security detail comparable to that of a sitting president, former Secret Service agent Joseph LaSorsa told the Reuters news agency. “There will be an intensive review… there's going to be a massive realignment,"" he said. ""This cannot happen."" The Republican National Convention will go ahead as planned on Monday, with a speech from Trump on Thursday, as confirmed by a statement from the party. During the event, Trump will be officially nominated as the Republican candidate for president ahead of November’s election.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87rvg61vrxo,"Frank Gardner, security correspondent, and James FitzGerald,",2024-07-14 15:09:46,
356,"First panic, then fury - what I witnessed at Trump rally","Sometimes sounds can be deceptive. A car backfiring can make you jump; a firework can make you flinch; but as soon as we heard the gunfire at the Butler Farm showgrounds shortly after 6pm on Saturday evening, we all knew straight away that these were gunshots, and there were lots of them. Donald Trump was mid-way through a sentence as the shots rang out. He grabbed his ear before dropping to the ground and being smothered by Secret Service agents. We didn’t know it at the time, but the gunman was perhaps 150m away from where we stood, lying flat on the roof of a shed and firing at least six rounds using an AR-15 rifle at the former president and terrifed spectators. I was about to go on air, with radio colleagues from the BBC World Service waiting on the end of a line. Instead all three of us in my team - me, producer Iona Hampson and cameraman Sam Beattie - went to the ground, using our car as some kind of shelter, the only shelter we had. We had no idea where the shooting was coming from; how many shooters there were; and how long it would go on for. Frankly it was terrifying. As we lay on the ground, Sam turned on his camera and I tried to give my first impressions of what was happening. In that moment, we had no more concrete information than that about six minutes into Donald Trump’s speech, the shooting had begun.  As I listened I could hear screams from the crowd but I could no longer hear the former president speaking. Was he hit, was he dead? All these thoughts flash through your mind. When we felt the shooting was over, Iona picked me up off the ground and we went live on television as shocked members of the crowd poured out of the exits. The range of emotions we encountered was immense, as Iona persuaded terrified spectators to come and talk to me live on television. Many were understandably frightened; many were dazed and bewildered; some were angry, very angry. One witness, a man named Greg, said he had seen the gunman “bear-crawling” onto the roof of the shed minutes before the chaos began and had been frantically trying to point him out to police and the Secret Service. Another man – and I can understand this – was furious that we were broadcasting; he put himself between me and Sam yelling at me to stop. I laid my hand as gently as I could on his arm and explained to him while we were on air that it was important people knew what had just happened; the public, I said, had to know. Eventually, as I pleaded with him, he relented – still unhappy and still fuming, rightly so, at what he’d just experienced.  Others expressed their anger in more political ways. One man approached me and simply said: “They shot first. This is [expletive] war.” Another just yelled “civil war” as he passed behind me. And a few minutes later a huge electronic billboard appeared on the side of a truck – Donald Trump’s face framed in a target – the words simply read “Democrats attempted assassination - President Trump”. It sent a shiver right up my spine – and the horror of the potential consequences of this act started to sink in. But amid the fear and anger, there was profound sorrow. People who were loyal Trump supporters, committed gun owners, wondered out loud to me about the way America was going. It was as if they could no longer recognise the country they lived in – as if everything had become strange and foreign. Devin, a local farmer, was there with his son Kolbie. It was their first ever political rally – Kolbie, just 14, still not old enough to vote. But Kolbie’s first experience of the rawness of democracy was to see two wounded people loaded onto stretchers and rushed off to ambulances. It’s hard not to believe that those images of muzzle flashes he witnessed from the Secret Service snipers who took down the gunman won’t stay with him for the rest of his life.  I’ve covered at least half a dozen shootings in my ten years as a correspondent in the US – but always the immediate aftermath – never have I been present until now when someone actually pulled the trigger. I don’t want to experience it again, and in this gun-loving country, even those committed to their handguns and rifles in this rural part of Western Pennsylvania seemed sickened and worried about the randomness of the violence they witnessed in late-afternoon sunshine as they wondered whether their political hero was still alive. But what happened in Butler goes much wider than arguments over gun control. America has been spiralling towards this moment for years – a political culture that is not just adversarial but downright poisonous. People here – or should I say some people here – find it easy to hate their political opponents – it’s visceral; it’s become part of the nation’s DNA to hate. And it’s not just political. You can see it in the divisions between the coasts and the centre. Between the north and the south; between the cities and rural America – everything being defined in terms of not being something or someone else. Moments in history can only really be judged in retrospect. But I’ll take a guess that last night will go down as one of those moments. The question for the leaders of public opinion in this country is what will they now choose to do – to inflame or to calm. To further divide or to reunite. As an outsider but someone who truly loves this nation, I’m not hopeful.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnl0xq0j9ewo,"Gary O'Donoghue,",2024-07-14 17:09:46,
355,Man killed during Trump shooting dived on family to protect them,"One man in the audience died while trying to protect his family during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Saturday, authorities say. Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief, dove onto family members when the shots rang out. “Corey died a hero,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at a news conference on Sunday. Pennsylvania state police said the other two people shot were 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver. Both were in a stable condition on Sunday. The Pennsylvania governor said that he spoke to Mr Comperatore’s wife and two daughters. “Corey went to church every Sunday,” he said. “Cory loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family.” He said that Mr Comperatore was an avid supporter of Donald Trump and was excited to be at the rally Saturday. “Corey was the very best of us. May his memory be a blessing,” Mr Shapiro said. “Last night was shocking… political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence.” State police said that Mr Comperatore lived in Sarver, about 12 miles (19km) away from the rally site in Butler, outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition to his volunteer firefighting work, he was employed as a project and tooling engineer at a plastics manufacturing company, according to his social media profiles. “He was a good person,” neighbour Matt Achilles told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “We might not have agreed on the same political views, but that didn’t stop him from being a good friend and neighbour.” “He donated money to us when I was in the hospital and he would always come by at our yard sales. He always waved hello when I drove past his house,” Mr Achilles said. Mr Shapiro said also he spoke to the family of one of those injured, but declined to give details about the conversation. A bullet, one of the six to eight shots that were fired at the rally, grazed the ear of former President Trump. The gunman, named by authorities as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by Secret Service officers tasked with protecting the former president.",2024-07-14 23:09:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2grvznd4jo,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-14 20:09:46,

357,How conspiracy theories and hate dominated social feeds after assassination attempt on Trump,"“Staged”. Within minutes of the news breaking about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, that word was trending on X in the United States. It's a word that has become synonymous with conspiracy theories on the fringes of social media, often to cast doubts on an attack or shooting. But in the last 24 hours it has flooded into mainstream online conversation, and posts filled with evidence-free speculation, hate and abuse have racked up millions of views on X. Assassination attempts on US presidents have in the past been magnets for conspiracy - the killing of John F Kennedy in November 1963, most famously. This one was the first to play out in real time, so it’s not surprising that unfounded rumours flourished. But what has stood out is how this frenzy gripped all sides of the political spectrum. It’s not been limited to committed groups of political supporters. Instead, it was actively recommended in users’ “For You” feeds as they tried to make sense of what had happened. And it was often posted by users who have purchased blue ticks, offering their posts greater prominence. As ever, the conspiracy theories sometimes started with legitimate questions and confusion. They centred on alleged security failings, with lots of users understandably asking how this could happen. How did the attacker make it to the roof? Why weren’t they stopped? Into that vacuum rushed a wave of disbelief, speculation and disinformation. “It looks very staged,” read one post on X which racked up a million views. “Nobody in the crowd is running or panicking. Nobody in the crowd heard an actual gun. I don’t trust it. I don’t trust him.” The profile says it’s based on the south-west coast of Ireland. Its since been labelled with a note on X pointing out the shooting was real. Once more footage and testimony from both inside and outside the rally was shared, the panic and fear of those there became all too clear. The conspiracies were compounded by the extraordinary images that have come out since those initial clips. In particular, a widely-praised photograph taken by the Associated Press chief photographer in Washington, Evan Vucci, that shows Trump, fist raised, blood on his face and ear, with the US flag in the background. One US-based YouTube account said the picture was just “too damn perfect” and described how they got “the flag positioned perfect and everything”. The post on X reached almost one million views - but was later deleted by the person who shared it. It’s important to correct yourself if you’re wrong, they said in a separate post. Others pointed out that, as the shots were fired, Trump raises his hand on stage. They used this to suggest the event was set up when there’s no evidence to suggest that. “Staged to get sympathy? You can’t trust these people with anything and no, I’m not going to pray for him,” a different US-based commentator wrote. Lots of the most viral posts, including this, came from left-leaning users who regularly share their anti-Trump views. They already had hundreds of thousands of followers before today - and therefore a significant reach. What unfolded on X was straight out of the pages of the conspiracy theory playbook, honed on social media by committed activists who deny the reality of almost everything, including the Covid pandemic, wars, mass shootings and terror attacks. One post from a US-based account with a track record of sharing unfounded claims like this wrote: “This is price you pay when you take down the elite satanic paedophiles.” They were alluding to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which suggests Trump is waging a secret war against a deep state - a shadowy coalition of security and intelligence services, hidden from plain sight, looking to thwart his every move. Without any evidence to support the idea, they then went on to suggest the “order” for the assassination “likely came from the CIA” and accused Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence of being involved. There is no evidence to support any of that - but the post has been seen 4.7 million times. It’s a familiar pattern, but the real change here is how this kind of lingo is being widely used by the average social media users. That’s not only people who don’t like Trump suggesting this was staged, but also ones who support him alleging this is part of a sprawling conspiracy theory. Elected politicians have also got involved. Congressman Mike Collins, a Republican in Georgia, posted that “Joe Biden sent the orders”. He referenced a comment President Biden had made earlier in the week about putting “Trump in a bullseye”,  referring to their election battle. There are legitimate questions being asked about some of the language used to describe Trump by other politicians and the media, as well as online, which some of Trump’s supporters argue has inflamed tensions and contributed to this assassination attempt. But to suggest this was ordered by President Biden is an entirely different proposition all together. Collins’ post has more than 6 million views on X - but has since been labelled with a community note, which says there is no evidence Mr Biden was involved in any way. It added that his “bullseye” remark has been taken out of context. Incorrect attempts to identify the shooter fed into the various evidence-free narratives. Before the FBI named the gunman as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot and killed by the Secret Service, other people’s reputations were being ruined. Like football commentator Marco Violi, who posted on Instagram in the middle of the night from Italy to say he’d seen the totally false claims he was a member of Antifa - a loose affiliation of mostly far-left activists - and behind the attack. Those untrue allegations had millions of views on X by the time he attempted to set the record straight on Instagram. On X, political activists and supporters quickly hunkered down in their own echo chambers, reading posts that were recommended by the site’s algorithm and confirmed what they already thought. The rest of us scrambled to avoid this deep pit of conspiracy and speculation. This was a test for Elon Musk’s new Twitter - and it’s hard to say the site passed with flying colours. The other social media sites haven’t been inundated in the same way, perhaps because of their target audience and X’s reputation as a home of political discourse. X has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment. What happened at the Trump Rally?

368,Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty dead at 53,"Actress Shannen Doherty, best known for roles in hit TV shows like Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed, died on Saturday from cancer at 53.  “It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty,” her publicist, Leslie Sloane, said in a statement. ""The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie."" Doherty spent over four decades as an actress. She is best known for playing Brenda Walsh on four seasons of 90210. The series followed a group of Beverly Hills teenagers as they faced relationship and family issues.  Ms Doherty was nominated for several awards for her role on the show.  She later went on to play Brenda in a 2008 reboot of the series where her character grew up to become a theatre actress. The actor was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2015 and underwent a mastectomy, radiation and chemotherapy. She announced she was in remission in 2017, but the cancer returned two years later. She was open about her battle with cancer, documenting it on social media. In a June 2023 Instagram video, she shared that the the cancer spread to her brain. She announced last fall that she is committed to battling the disease despite it spreading to her bones.  ""I'm not done with living. I'm not done with loving. I'm not done with creating,"" she said to People magazine in November 2023.  Born in Memphis, Ms Doherty started acting as a child. She appeared in TV series including Voyagers, Our House and Father Murphy before starring as Jenny Wilder at the age of 11 in Little House on the Prairie.  Three years later in 1985, she got her first major film role starring in Girls Just Want to Have Fun, which also starred Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt.  In 1988, Ms Doherty played Heather Duke in the iconic teen film Heathers alongside Winona Ryder, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker.  The actress struggled at the time with being young and famous, earning a reputation as a troublemaker on the set of 90210.  ""I was very confused back then about what I wanted for myself, and the attention was way too much,"" she said. ""I didn't always handle it that well."" She later starred in Charmed, a show about three sisters who were witches.  Ms Doherty also played roles in North Shore, set in a Hawaii hotel, and the offbeat film comedy Mallrats. The actress was married twice before marrying her current husband, photographer Kurt Iswarienko, in 2011. In the 2010s, she ventured into reality TV appearing on Dancing With The Stars and the US version of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing.  Ms Doherty was a passionate animal rights activist. Her semi-autobiographical book Badass, released in 2010, encouraged young women to live life with attitude and confidence.

361,IDF says senior Hamas commander killed in Israeli air strike,"The Israeli military says senior Hamas commander Rafa Salama was killed in an air strike in Gaza on Saturday. Hamas has not confirmed the report.  The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said that Israel's strike hit a camp for displaced people in a designated humanitarian zone in Khan Younis, killing at least 90 Palestinians and injuring 289 others. Israel has said the strike was targeting senior Hamas leaders, but Hamas says the claim is ""false"" and serves to ""justify"" the attack. Eyewitnesses said they saw at least five ""big warplanes bombing in the middle of Al Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis"". Most of the injured were sent to the nearby Nasser hospital.  However, according to officials and medics, the facility is “no longer able to function” as doctors are “overwhelmed with large numbers of casualties”. Speaking to Newshour on the BBC World Service, Dr Mohammed Abu Rayya, who is at a hospital dealing with the aftermath of the attack, said the majority of those injured were suffering from multiple shrapnel wounds. He said it was like being in ""hell"", adding that many of the casualties were civilians, notably women and children.  The Israeli army said Salama, a commander of the Khan Younis Brigade, was one of the ""masterminds"" of the 7 October attack and a close associate of Mohammed Deif, the top commander of Hamas's military wing.  A military spokesman said Salama's death ""significantly impedes Hamas’ military capabilities"". It is not known whether Deif was killed. The Israeli army said he was also targeted in the strike.  Deif has been among Israel's most wanted men for decades and is blamed by Israeli authorities for the killings of multiple civilians and soldiers. In a joint statement reporting Salama's ""elimination"", the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) said Salama joined Hamas in the early 1990s and was appointed to the position of commander of the Khan Younis Brigade under the command of Mohammed Sinwar.  A Hamas official, cited by Reuters, called the attack a ""grave escalation"" that showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire agreement.

362,Kenyan police relocated following body parts discovery,"Officers at a police station near a rubbish dump where dismembered body parts were found have been transferred, Kenya's acting inspector general of police has said. On Sunday, Douglas Kanja Kirocho said that so far, eight female bodies had been retrieved from the site in the capital, Nairobi. Kenya's police watchdog previously announced it was investigating whether there was police involvement in the gruesome deaths, which come amid allegations of widespread human rights abuses by officers during recent anti-government protests.  Mr Kirocho said officers from Kware police station were being moved to ensure ""fair and unbiased investigations"" into the ""heinous"" deaths. Detectives have been scouring the site in the Mukuru slum since Friday, when the corpses of six women were found in sacks floating in a sea of rubbish. On Saturday, five other bags containing body parts were recovered. Preliminary reports show that the bodies were in various stages of decomposition and that the deceased were aged between 18 and 30. Officers said some of the bags included severed legs and torsos, speculating that the deaths could be related to the activities of cultists or serial killers. But the Independent Police Oversight Authority said “widespread allegations of police involvement in unlawful arrests [and] abductions” meant it was undertaking a preliminary investigation to establish whether there was any police connection.  Human rights groups have accused the police of shooting dozens of people who were demonstrating against planned tax rises earlier this month, some of them fatally.  The police have also been accused of abducting or arbitrarily arresting hundreds more during the protests. Responding to the bodies found in Mukuru, the Independent Police Oversight Authority said: ""The bodies, wrapped in bags and secured by nylon ropes, had visible marks of torture and mutilation."" The watchdog also noted that the dump site was less than 100m from Kware police station.  In contradiction to the police's report, the Independent Police Oversight Authority said nine dismembered bodies were found at the Mukuru dump - seven female and two male. Mr Kirocho said the police were working to conclude their investigation into the deaths ""within 21 days"". The bodies are being kept at a funeral home in Nairobi, pending post-mortem examinations.  Local media reported that police deployed two water cannons to the scene on Saturday, after angry protesters threatened to open the bags filled with human remains.  Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) urged people to keep calm and grant them space to investigate the discoveries, accusing protesters of impeding their investigation. The grisly find has put pressure on President William Ruto, who has vowed that those behind the killings will be punished.  ""We are a democratic country guided by the rule of law. Those involved in mysterious killings in Nairobi and any other part of the country will be held to account,"" he said in a post to X, formerly Twitter.  The case is the latest disturbing such incident in Kenya.  Last year the country was left horrified after the remains of hundreds of people associated with a doomsday cult were discovered in the Indian Ocean coastal town of Malindi.  Paul Nthenge Mackenzie went on trial in Mombasa earlier this week on charges of terrorism and murder over the deaths of more than 440 of his followers. He denies the allegations.  He is alleged to have encouraged men, women and children to starve themselves in order to ""meet Jesus"", in one of the world's worst cult-related massacres.

363,King Charles and Queen Camilla to visit Australia in October,"King Charles III and Queen Camilla are set to visit Australia and Samoa in October, as the King takes on more public duties while receiving cancer treatment. The pair will carry out engagements in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, before heading to Samoa for a Commonwealth summit. The King will make the lengthy journey despite his diagnosis for an undisclosed form of cancer earlier this year. But Buckingham Palace have confirmed that the couple will not visit New Zealand, saying doctors have advised against an extended visit on health grounds. ""In close consultation with the Australian and New Zealand prime ministers, and with due regard for the pressures of time and logistics, it has therefore been agreed to limit the visit to Samoa and Australia only,"" the Palace said in a statement. This will be the King's first visit to Australia as Monarch. It is also his first official overseas tour since his cancer diagnosis. In Samoa, they will attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. In Australia, their programme includes visits to the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. The couple are expected to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm), which brings together delegations from the 56 countries in the Commonwealth.  Further details of the visit to the two countries are expected to be announced shortly, and the couple's programme and schedule changes will be subject to doctor's advice. The 75-year-old monarch last visited Australia in 2018 with the Queen for the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Australians narrowly voted against cutting ties with the monarchy in a referendum in 1999, but calls have continued in the quarter-century since for another ballot. It is a longstanding policy of Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to hold a vote on becoming a republic - but in January the government indicated that it has put that referendum on hold, saying it was not a priority. Buckingham Palace confirmed in February that the King would pause some public events while receiving treatment for cancer. At the time they said it was not prostate cancer, and that it was discovered during treatment for an enlarged prostate.  The King later returned to public-facing engagements in April when he spoke to patients at the University College London Hospital about the ""shock"" of hearing about his cancer diagnosis. In recent weeks, he visited Normandy as part of a D-Day commemoration event, hosted actor Idris Elba for a summit on tackling youth crime and hosted the Japanese emperor and empress during their state visit to the UK. Earlier on Sunday, the Princess of Wales presented the Wimbledon men's singles trophy to Carlos Alcaraz, in her second public appearance since confirming her cancer diagnosis earlier this year. Catherine made her return to public duties with an appearance at Trooping the Colour last month, waving and smiling from the Buckingham Palace balcony with her children. At the time, the princess addressed her cancer diagnosis in a statement saying that while she is making ""good progress"", she was ""not out of the woods yet"".",2024-07-14 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yg8d4zdvo,"Vicky Wong,",2024-07-14 21:09:47,
364,In maps: Donald Trump assassination attempt,"Former US president Donald Trump was rushed off stage at a campaign rally after  an assassination attempt. Shots rang out as he was speaking at the event in Pennsylvania, sparking panic in the crowd. The former US president, who emerged with a bloodied face and was pictured pumping his fist in the air, says he was shot in the ear. He had been speaking at a campaign rally at Butler Farm Show Grounds, about 30 miles (50km) north of Pittsburgh, on Saturday when loud bangs were heard. The suspected gunman – later named as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, from Bethel Park in Pennsylvania - was among two people killed. Two more people were critically injured. The US Secret Service said the gunman had fired “multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position” but had been shot dead by service personnel. Video footage from the event shows law enforcement snipers on the roof of a building behind where Mr Trump was speaking, although it is not clear if they fired the shots that killed the gunman.  The gunman had been on a rooftop about 130m (430ft) from where Mr Trump was speaking – one witness told the BBC the gunman may have been hidden from the authorities by the slope of the roof he was lying on. When the shots were fired, Mr Trump reached his right hand to his face before ducking as Secret Service agents surrounded him on stage. As the agents began taking Mr Trump to his motorcade, he turned to the crowd, and with blood running from his right ear, he repeatedly pumped his fist in the air.",2024-07-14 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevwngjrwzno,"the Visual Journalism team,",2024-07-14 15:09:47,

366,‘We are the Church’: Kenyan tax protesters take on Christian leaders,"In Kenya, the youth protests against planned tax increases have served as a wake-up call for the Church. They’ve shaken up a powerful institution, in a country where more than 80% of the population, including the president, are Christian. The young demonstrators accused the Church of siding with the government, and took action against politicians using the pulpit as a political platform. On a recent Sunday afternoon, Catholic leaders responded to the challenge. They organised a special Mass for the youth from churches in and around Nairobi, to honour those who’d been killed by police in the anti-tax protests. Hundreds of young people crowded into the Holy Family Basilica to pray for the dead. Just weeks earlier, Sunday Mass had been interrupted by chants from the altar of the basilica.  It was an unprecedented protest from young people – the digitally savvy generation known as Generation Z or Gen-Z.  They felt the church wasn’t backing their campaign against tough tax hikes. Now, Bishop Simon Kamomoe tried to convince them they’d been heard. “I know as young people sometimes you feel disappointed even in the Church,” he said. “We would like to renew our commitment in serving you. We can be mistaken…May the Lord forgive us as a Church, where even before God, we have disappointed you.” He also admonished them to be patient in pursuit of their dreams, to be guided by the Church, and to repent of any sins committed during the protests. “We don't want to lose you, we don't want to lose our young people,” he said, with remarkable candour. “The Catholic bishops are so concerned about losing this generation,” he said, urging them to stay peaceful and protect their lives. The Mass was punctuated by spirited singing and ended with boisterous cheering as people waved Kenyan flags.  Several who attended said the service was a welcome first step, but a belated one. “I feel like for the first time, the Church is realising that the young people are serious,” said Yebo, who attended the protests before they turned violent and wanted to remain anonymous.  “And I feel also the Church hasn't been really on our side. They have been sitting on the fence for a long time. “The youth have actually been more persistent, they have brought results more than the Church with the current economic change. We can hear the president is taking the youth more serious than he takes the Church serious.” Church organisations did lobby against the tax bill, but it was young people taking to the streets in overwhelming numbers that forced President William Ruto to back down. Not only that. The Gen-Z protesters are now condemning what they see as the cozy relationship between Christian and political institutions.  Again and again on the sidelines of the Mass, they mentioned suspicions about visits by Church leaders to the State House, the presidential residence, including during the protests. “We believe the president is buying the Church,” said Meshack Mwendwa.  On social media “the Church leaders are seen holding envelopes (alongside) the executive leaders and the permanent members of the government,"" he said. ""And that's not what we want as the youth, now it’s time for a change.” One change they demanded, and got, was an end to the ostentatious practice of “harambee” – politicians giving large sums of money to the Church.  Such donations can buy political influence on Sunday mornings. The protest movement aimed to stop that – they called it #OccupyChurch.  Some even demonstrated against President Ruto’s attendance at a Church-sponsored event. But he supported their position. “On matters of politics on the pulpit I am 100% aligned,” he told a media roundtable that aired nationally.  “We shouldn't be using the pulpit in churches or in any other places of worship, to prosecute politics. It is not right.” Several days later, he banned state officers and public servants from making public charitable donations, and directed the attorney general to develop a mechanism for structured and transparent contributions. But the president himself has been part of this political culture, converting the pulpit into a campaign platform. “His political message was actually driven within the Church,” says Reverend Chris Kinyanjui, the general secretary of Kenya’s National Council of Churches (NCCK).  “So, people feel that they have a Christian government.” Mr Ruto’s Christian narrative has made it difficult for many pastors to hold him to account, Rev Kinyanjui said. Rather they behave like “shareholders of this administration,"" he claimed. ""Our president speaks from the pulpit. You know what the pulpit means? He cannot be questioned. So, he has become a very powerful figure in Kenya's politics and church circles. The Gen-Z are questioning, and are saying, we don't know the difference between the government and the Church."" The BBC asked the Kenyan government for a response but the spokesman said he was unable to comment right now. He was speaking amidst sweeping changes in the cabinet and security services made by Mr Ruto in response to the protests. The backlash from Kenya’s young people has the potential to reshape the way power works in Kenya.  They make up the vast majority of the population, and are outside predictable political dynamics.  The president is listening now, and so is the Church. “We are the Church,” said Mitchelee Mbugua outside the basilica as the Mass wound up.  “If the Church shows that they don't support us, we draw away from them. If there are no us, there's not a Church. So, they have to listen to our grievances. Because we are the Church.” Rev Kinyanjui goes further, underlining what he sees as the fragility of the social contract with Kenya’s youth. He acknowledged that NCCK leadership had been worried that Kenya might go the way of Sudan. There, a youth revolution was aborted by a military coup, which eventually led to civil war. “We were happy that the president was able to defuse [this crisis],” he said, “because if he had signed that finance bill into law, who knows what we'd have become.” Rev Kinyanjui said the NCCK came out “too quietly” against the finance bill. Going forward they will adopt a strategy of “being proactive, being visible, being the voice of and the consciousness of society… by questioning, by correcting the regime.” “In a way, we see the Gen-Z as doing the Lord's work, and I think that's something that has made many pastors to wake up.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

367,Melania Trump speaks out: 'Ascend above the hate',"Melania Trump released a statement in the hours after a gunman attempted to shoot and kill her husband, calling on Americans to repair political divisions and focus on love.  ""Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy and political games are inferior to love,"" she said.   In her message, she referred to the man behind the assassination attempt Saturday as a ""monster"" and denounced the ""violent"" attack on Donald Trump's life. Mrs Trump's statement breaks a relatively long streak of silence, having mostly stayed off the campaign trail during the former president's re-election effort and away from cameras amid his legal battles.  The former first lady's quiet resignation to her personal life, however, ended at least temporarily, with the statement Sunday. ""When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life were on the brink of devastating change,"" Mrs Trump said.  ""I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.""  Mrs Trump also paid tribute to the other victims of the attack.  ""To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy,"" she said.  Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident, allegedly took aim Saturday evening at Donald Trump with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire. The Republican presidential canidate's ear was grazed, one person was killed, and two others injured, police have said.  During the attack, Crooks was shot and killed by authorities.  In her message, Mrs Trump sought to remind readers of her husband's humanity, the Trump family's humanity - and America's humanity.  ""Let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here in this earthly realm.""  Mrs Trump recently made news headlines when she was not listed as a speaker at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin this week.  She did, however, speak at the conventions in 2016 and 2020, underscoring possibly  how much she has chosen to avoid the limelight recently.  But the gravity of the moment forced her back into the spotlight this weekend. ""This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,"" she said.  ""We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first and love transcends.""",2024-07-14 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19kw8jzvvmo,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-14 17:09:47,
369,Alcaraz crushes Djokovic to retain Wimbledon title,"This video can not be played Highlights: Alcaraz beats Djokovic in straight sets to retain Wimbledon title Carlos Alcaraz powered to victory over an out-of-sorts Novak Djokovic to retain his men's singles title at Wimbledon. Although the players on show made this a repeat of last year's final, it failed to live up to the five-set thriller of 12 months ago as Djokovic appeared mostly helpless against the dominant Spaniard. Despite squandering three championship points when trying to serve out a rapid victory, Alcaraz found focus again and held his arms aloft after battling through the third-set tie-break for a 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-4) win. ""Honestly, it is a dream for me winning this trophy,"" said Alcaraz, who was presented with the trophy by the Princess of Wales. ""I did an interview when I was 11 and I said my dream is to win Wimbledon."" Gracious in defeat, Djokovic shared a smile and warm embrace with Alcaraz at the net after his comprehensive loss. For a second straight year, Djokovic was attempting to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon men's titles. The 24-time major winner was also trying to move ahead of Margaret Court to take sole ownership of the all-time record for the most Grand Slam singles titles. Djokovic has enjoyed many magnificent days on Centre Court, but this was one he is unlikely to look back on with any great fondness. As modern tradition dictates, Alcaraz climbed up to the players' box and was leapt upon by his team and family, celebrating a 14th consecutive match win at Wimbledon. The result continues the four-time major winner's 100% record in Grand Slam finals, while he becomes the youngest man to win at Wimbledon and the French Open in the same year. Later on Sunday evening, Alcaraz celebrated Spain's Euro 2024 final victory over England - making it a perfect day for him and his country. 'An all-round perfect performance' - so what next for Alcaraz? 'I'm not at level of Alcaraz or Sinner' - Djokovic  This video can not be played Alcaraz's reaction as he retains Wimbledon title Alcaraz had looked far from convincing for the majority of this year's Championships - winning in straight sets just twice before the final. He had to show resilience to wrestle his way through matches, fighting back against Daniil Medvedev, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe to sustain his title defence. It made his run to the final all the more impressive, with his never-say-die mentality the mark of a true champion. And in Sunday's final, Alcaraz showed he was saving his best tennis for the last, all-important moment. Former British number one Tim Henman called it an ""annihilation"", while 1987 Wimbledon winner Pat Cash described it as a ""perfect performance"". Alcaraz reeled off deft drop shots, perfect volleys and thunderous forehand winners that seemed to stun his 37-year-old opponent. Following in the footsteps of his fellow Spaniard and hero Rafael Nadal in 2008 and 2010, Alcaraz has achieved the rare feat of winning at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year. ""Credit to Carlos for playing elite tennis, especially from the back of the court. He had it all today,"" Djokovic said in his runner-up speech. This video can not be played Djokovic reacts to his defeat in the Wimbledon final When it was revealed that Djokovic had undergone surgery on 5 June for a medial meniscus tear in his right knee, it was not just his title chances that were thrown into doubt. There were concerns that he would be unable to play at Wimbledon at all. However, if it was not for the support on his knee, it would have been almost impossible to tell Djokovic had suffered a serious injury. The seven-time Wimbledon champion had resumed his usual brand of dominant, consistent tennis and dropped just two sets in six matches. But the level suddenly dropped on Sunday, and Djokovic's game looked unrecognisable with failed attempts to come to the net and handfuls of unforced errors. What was expected to be an enthralling sequel got off to the most dramatic of beginnings - a 14-minute service game from Djokovic, who saved four break points before finally going behind. Alcaraz's confident start continued, while a rare double fault from Djokovic gifted a double break that allowed the Spanish third seed to calmly see out the opener. It was a case of deja vu for the Serb in the second set, with Alcaraz landing delicate drop volleys and booming winners to break early before benefiting from another Djokovic double fault. Still toiling, Djokovic managed to hold firm in the third until Alcaraz struck to lead 5-4 and give himself a chance to serve out for the title. But the 21-year-old double-faulted on his first match point, fired into the net on his second and then sent the ball wide on his third - helping Djokovic to claw a break back and force a tie-break. At that point, prospects of a remarkable comeback and thrilling finish quickly vanished as Alcaraz took control. ""It obviously was not the result I wanted, but of course in the first couple of sets the level of tennis wasn’t up to par from my side,"" Djokovic said. ""It wasn't meant to be. I tried to extend the match, but he was an absolute deserved winner today so congratulations for him.""

373,What are the big security threats coming down the track?,"On the face of it, this past week’s Nato summit in Washington has ticked the boxes. The alliance can show it is bigger and stronger than ever, its military support for Ukraine appears undiminished and it has just sent a robust message to China to stop secretly supporting Russia’s war on Kyiv. Sir Keir Starmer’s new government has had a chance to position itself as a linchpin in the transatlantic alliance at a time when political uncertainty hovers over the White House and much of Europe. Back home in Britain, the priorities for this new government are pressing: the economy, housing, immigration, the NHS, to name but a few.  Yet unwanted threats and scenarios can often have a habit of turning up and upsetting the best laid plans. So what could be coming down the track during the life of this new UK government?  No surprises here, this one is on everybody’s radar. But that does not make it any less dangerous, for Lebanon, Israel and the entire Middle East. ""The possibility of a large-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon this summer should be at the top of the new government’s geopolitical risk register.""  That’s according to Professor Malcolm Chalmers, the Deputy Director-General of the Whitehall think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  With the conflict continuing in Gaza and the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping continuing, Prof Chalmers believes ""we could be entering a period of sustained multi-front warfare in the region, for which neither Israel nor its Western partners will be prepared."" Ever since the Hamas-led raid into southern Israel on 7 October last year, there have been fears that Israel’s subsequent military campaign in Gaza could escalate across borders into a full-scale regional war. Israel’s troubled northern border with Lebanon is where such a war is most at risk of igniting.  The daily exchange of fire across this border, between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia, have already resulted in hundreds killed, mostly in Lebanon.  More than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods in the north and an even greater number of people on the Lebanese side.  Domestic pressure is mounting for the Israeli government to ""deal with"" Hezbollah by pushing its forces north of Lebanon’s Litani River, from where they would have less chance of sending rockets into Israel. ""We don’t want to go to war,"" says Lt Col Nadav Shoshani of the IDF, ""but I don’t think any country could accept 60,000 of its citizens displaced. The situation has to end. We would like it to be a diplomatic solution, but Israeli patience is wearing thin.""  There are strong reasons for both sides not to go to war. Lebanon’s economy is already fragile. It has barely recovered from the 2006 war with Israel and a renewed full-scale conflict would have a devastating impact on the country’s infrastructure and its people. Hezbollah, for its part, would likely respond to a major Israeli attack and invasion with a massive and sustained missile, drone and rocket barrage that could potentially overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome air defences.  Nowhere in Israel is beyond its reach. At this point, the US Navy, positioned offshore, could well join in on Israel’s side. Which then begs the question of what Iran would do.  It too has a sizeable arsenal of ballistic missiles as well as a network of proxy militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria that could be mobilised to intensify their attacks on Israel. One way to take the heat out of the tension on the Israel-Lebanon border would be for the conflict in Gaza to come to an end. But after nine months and a horrific death toll, a lasting peace has yet to be achieved. The Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to contain and monitor Iran’s nuclear programme, was the crowning foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration in 2015.  But it has long since fallen apart.  One year after President Trump unilaterally withdrew from it, Iran stopped abiding by its rules.  Buried deep beneath gigantic mountains, ostensibly beyond the reach of even the most powerful of bunker-busting bombs, Iran’s nuclear centrifuges have been spinning frantically, enriching uranium to well beyond the 20% needed for peaceful civil purposes. (A nuclear bomb requires highly enriched uranium.) Officially, Iran insists its nuclear programme remains entirely peaceful, that it is purely for generating energy.  But Israeli and Western experts have voiced fears that Iran has a clandestine programme to reach what is known as ""breakout capability"": achieving a position where it has the capacity to build a nuclear bomb, but does not necessarily do so. It will not have escaped Iran’s notice that North Korea, an isolated, global pariah, has been steadily amassing an arsenal of nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them, constituting a major deterrent to any would-be attacker. If Iran gets the Bomb, then it is almost inevitable that Saudi Arabia, its regional rival, would also go after acquiring it. So would Turkey and so would Egypt.  And suddenly there is a nuclear arms race all across the Middle East. This depends on what you define as ""winning"".  At its maximalist, it means Russian forces overwhelming Ukraine’s defences and seizing the rest of the country including the capital Kyiv, replacing the pro-West government of President Volodymyr Zelensky with a puppet regime appointed by Moscow.  That, of course, was the original plan behind the full-scale Russian invasion of February 2022, a plan which failed spectacularly. This scenario is currently thought unlikely.  But Russia does not need to conquer the whole of Ukraine to be able to declare some kind of ""victory"", something that it can present to its population to justify the astronomically high casualties it is sustaining in this war. Russia already occupies around 18% of Ukraine and, in the east, its forces are slowly gaining ground.  Although more Western weapons are on their way, Ukraine is critically short of manpower. Its troops, fighting bravely, often heavily outnumbered and outgunned, are exhausted.  Russian commanders, who seem to care little for the lives of their men, have mass on their side. Russia’s entire economy has been placed on a war footing, with close to 40% of the state budget now devoted to defence. President Vladimir Putin, whose recent ""conditions for peace talks"" equated to total capitulation by Ukraine, believes he has time on his side. He knows there is a high chance that his old friend Donald Trump will be back in the White House within months and that Western support for Ukraine will start to crumble. Russia needs only to hang on to the territory it has already seized, and to deny Ukraine the chance of joining Nato and the EU, to declare a partial victory in the war it has portrayed as a fight for Russian survival. Again, there are plenty of warnings that this one might be coming.  China’s President Xi Jinping and his officials have stated on numerous occasions that the self-governing island democracy of Taiwan must be ""returned to the Motherland"", by force if necessary. Taiwan does not want to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing. But China considers Taiwan a renegade province and it wants to see it ""reunited"" well before the centenary of the founding of the CCP in 2049. The US has adopted a position of what it calls ""strategic ambiguity"" over Taiwan.  It is legally bound to help defend Taiwan, but Washington prefers to keep China guessing as to whether that means sending US forces to fight off a Chinese invasion. China would almost certainly prefer not to invade Taiwan.  It would be hugely costly, in both blood and treasure. Ideally, Beijing would like Taiwan to give up on its dreams of full independence and volunteer to be ruled by the mainland.  But as that currently looks unlikely – the Taiwanese have watched with horror the crushing of democracy in Hong Kong – Beijing has another option up its sleeve.  If and when it decides to move on Taiwan, it is likely to try to seal it off from the outside world, making life unbearable for its citizens, but with the minimum of bloodshed so as to avoid provoking a war with the US. Does Taiwan matter? It does.  This is about more than lofty principles of defending a democratic ally on the other side of the world.  Taiwan produces more than 90% of the world’s top-end microchips, the miniscule bits of tech that power almost everything that runs our modern-day lives. A US-China war over Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy that would dwarf the war in Ukraine. Not exactly, but there are some moderating factors here. For China, trade is all-important. Beijing’s ambitious plans to squeeze the US Navy out of the western Pacific and dominate the entire region may well be tempered by its reluctance to trigger damaging sanctions and a global trade war. In Ukraine, President Putin may be making slow, incremental territorial gains but this comes at a horrendous cost in casualties.  When the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s, it suffered around 15,000 killed over a decade, triggering protests at home and hastening the demise of the Soviet Union.  In Ukraine, in just one quarter of that time, Russia has suffered many multiples of that death toll. To date, protest has been limited - the Kremlin largely controls what news Russians see - but the longer this war goes on, the greater the risk that the Russian public will eventually baulk at the mounting number of their fellow citizens getting killed. In Europe, where worries abound over a future Trump presidency withdrawing its historic protection, a new UK-led security pact is being prepared.  As the US presidential election in November draws closer, plans are accelerating to try to  mitigate any possible downsides to the continent’s security.",2024-07-14 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g4pjj2gwo,"Frank Gardner,",2024-07-14 05:09:48,
372,Orban goes global as self-styled peacemaker without a plan,"Hungary's Viktor Orban has no peace plan of his own, but he has spent the past two weeks on a whistle-stop tour of Kyiv, Moscow, Azerbaijan, Beijing, Washington and even Mar-a-Lago, on a one-man mission that has infuriated leaders in the EU and US. ""Peace will not come by itself in the Russia-Ukraine war, someone has to make it,"" he proclaims in videos posted daily on his Facebook page. He has been bitterly attacked by both Brussels and Washington for breaking EU and Nato unity and cosying up to Vladimir Putin and China’s leader Xi Jinping. Few argue with his central premise, that there can be no peace without peacemakers. But his close economic relationship with Russia’s president leaves him open to the charge of acting as Mr Putin’s puppet. The right-wing Hungarian PM says a ceasefire tied to a specific deadline would be a start. ""I am not negotiating on behalf of anyone,"" he told Hungarian radio during a brief stopover in Budapest between visits to Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and Mr Putin in Moscow. For the next six months, Hungary holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. Mr Orban followed up his first visit to Kyiv since the start of the war with the first trip by an EU leader to Russia since April 2022. That visit to the Kremlin clearly angered his European partners. Charles Michel, the head of the European Council of 27 EU governments, said the rotating presidency gave no mandate to engage with Russia on the EU’s behalf. Mr Orban admitted that was the case, but insisted: ""I’m clarifying the facts… I’m asking questions."" In Kyiv he posed ""three or four"" to President Zelensky ""so that we can understand his intentions, and where the red line is, the boundary up to which he can go in the interest of peace"". He has also been generous in his praise of two other allies, Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Meeting Mr Erdogan on arrival at the Nato summit in Washington, he spoke of him as ""the only man who has overseen an agreement between Russia and Ukraine"" so far, referring to a now defunct Black Sea grain agreement. ""China not only loves peace but has also put forward a series of constructive and important initiatives [for resolving the war],"" he said of President Xi Jinping, according to Chinese state media. The final visit on his whirlwind tour was to presidential candidate Donald Trump, another close ally who he strongly backs to win again in November and who he refers to as a man of peace. In one interview, he declared that during Trump’s four-year term as president “he did not initiate a single war"". This has been a remarkable trip in the international limelight for the leader of a small East European country with 9.7 million inhabitants. But who is it designed to impress, and could it have any effect? A key target of his message is the domestic public. Viktor Orban has had a relatively bad year so far, losing the two most prominent female politicians in his party to a scandal in February, and witnessing the emergence of his first serious challenger for more than a decade - Peter Magyar. In June, Mr Orban’s Fidesz party won an impressive 45% in European elections, to 30% for Mr Magyar’s three-month-old Tisza party. But he lost more than 700,000 votes (one in four) compared with the last parliamentary elections in 2022.  For the first time, he does not look invincible. What better way to show Hungarians that their leader was still strong than to parade across the world stage, in a global tour ""to make peace""? His mission was also targeted at an international public, in the week that his new Patriots for Europe (PfE) group in the European Parliament attracted 84 MEPs from mainly far-right parties in 11 countries. Patriots for Europe has emerged as the third largest faction in parliament, edging aside the rival Conservatives and Reformist group of Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. Mr Orban's visit to Moscow won him effusive praise from the Russians: “We take it very, very positively. We believe it can be very useful,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The US was less impressed. “We would welcome, of course, actual diplomacy with Russia to make it clear to Russia that they need to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, that they need to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity,” said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. “But that is not at all what this visit appears to have been.” At the same time, the US did welcome Mr Orban's first visit to neighbouring Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. The Hungarian leader has given very little away about the actual content of his talks in Kyiv, Moscow or Beijing. A leaked version of his letter to Charles Michel, sent from Azerbaijan, offers some clues. Mr Putin was open to a ceasefire, Mr Orban told the European Council president, provided it did not provide Ukraine with a chance to reorganise its army on the front lines. Three days earlier in Kyiv, on 2 July, the Ukrainian leader used a similar argument, telling Mr Orban that the Russians would abuse any ceasefire to regroup their invading forces.  Mr Orban was apparently ""surprised"" that President Zelensky still believed Ukraine could win back its lost territories. And Vladimir Putin told Mr Orban that ""time favours Russian forces"", according to the leaked letter. Arriving in Washington days later, Mr Orban posted yet another video on Facebook, saying he would argue that Nato ""should return to its original spirit: Nato should win peace, not the wars around it"". Unlike his Nato allies, Viktor Orban views Russia’s two-and-a-half year war in Ukraine as a civil war between two Slav nations, prolonged by US support for one of them. One thing he probably does agree on is that this autumn the conflict will become only worse. A Trump presidential victory in November, he believes, would force the Ukrainians and Russians to the negotiating table.",2024-07-14 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxw2k9dnjmno,"Nick  Thorpe,",2024-07-12 23:09:48,
370,"Remembering Shannen Doherty, the Beverly Hills 'badass'","Fans are mourning US actress Shannen Doherty, who has died the age of 53 of cancer.  “It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty,” her publicist, Leslie Sloane said. Doherty enjoyed a screen career spanning four decades as the star of hit TV shows like Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed. Although Doherty and the characters she played usually seemed to inhabit a glossier, more beautiful world, she was always someone viewers could relate to on screen, and was a self-proclaimed ""badass"" in real life. The Memphis-born star began acting as a child with appearances in TV series such as Voyagers, Our House and Father Murphy, before joining the cast of the long-running Little House on the Prairie as Jenny Wilder at the age of 11 in 1982. Her first major film role came in 1985 with Girls Just Want to Have Fun, which also starred Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt. Three years later, she played Heather Duke, a member of the high school clique in cult 1988 teen drama Heathers, starring alongside Winona Ryder, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker. When a rebooted television series was commissioned in 2016, Doherty played the mother of one of the new generation of Heathers. In 1990, Doherty landed the biggest role of her career - as Brenda Walsh in the original Beverly Hills, 90210. The TV series followed a group of teenagers as they dealt with relationship and family issues that were relatable beyond the glamorous Beverly Hills setting. While working on the show in the 1990s, she developed a reputation as something of a troublemaker, with reports accusing her of heated feuds with her fellow actors. ""There were times when we wanted to claw each other's eyes out,"" Doherty's co-star Jennie Garth admitted in 2014. But the pair became close friends as they grew older. Doherty admitted she struggled to handle the fame. ""I was very confused back then about what I wanted for myself, and the attention was way too much,"" she said. ""I didn't always handle it that well. ""And in truth, I was just shooting myself in the foot because the more I fought it, the more the celebrity took over versus the actor, and then the press ran with it."" She told another interviewer: ""Maybe my career would have taken a different direction if I'd been wiser and older, but I wasn't. I started young and I got 90210 kind of success very early, and it came at a time in my life where I was a petrified kid."" Doherty left 90210 after four seasons, with Brenda being written out to go to prestigious drama school Rada in London. While the actress mellowed and became more private as she got older, she played up to her reputation with the release of 2010's Badass, a semi-autobiographical book that encouraged young women to find their ""inner badass"" and live life with attitude and confidence. Doherty went on to star in shows including Charmed, which followed a trio of sisters who are the most powerful good witches of all time, and North Shore, set in a Hawaii hotel. In 1995, she starred in the offbeat film comedy Mallrats. Away from the screen, Doherty had a somewhat turbulent romantic life. She married Ashley Hamilton, the son of actor George Hamilton, two weeks after meeting him in 1993, but they divorced just six months later. She wed her second husband Rick Salomon in 2002, but the marriage was annulled after nine months. She married her third husband, a photographer named Kurt Iswarienko, in 2011. The couple stayed together until her death. As she got older, Doherty became a passionate animal rights activist and participated in campaigns against animal cruelty. She also ventured into reality TV as the genre became popular in the noughties, and in 2010 she appeared in Dancing With The Stars, the US version of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. Beverly Hills, 90210 remained the role she was best known for, and in 2008 she joined the cast of a new version of the show, reprising her role of Brenda Walsh. In the reboot, Brenda had grown up to become a successful theatre actress and stage director. But in her personal life, Doherty began to struggle with her health. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2015. The following year, she had a mastectomy and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She initially announced her cancer was in remission in 2017, but it returned two years later. At the time, Doherty was appearing in another reboot of 90210, which she said she was keen to take part in to honour her former co-star Luke Perry, who died of a stroke aged 52. ""It's so weird for me to be diagnosed and then somebody who was seemingly healthy to go first,"" said Doherty. ""It was really shocking. And the least I could do to honour him was to do that show."" The latest version, titled BH90210, put a new spin on it. Rather than being a straightforward reboot, it followed Doherty and many of the other original cast members playing heightened, parody versions of their real selves. Doherty kept the return of the disease secret at first, opting not to tell her fellow cast members except Brian Austin Green. ""I had moments of great anxiety where I thought, 'I can't really do this,'"" she explained. ""Prior to shooting, Brian would always call me and say, 'Listen, you know, whatever happens, I have your back.' So Brian helped me through a lot."" In recent years, she openly documented her battle with cancer on social media - posting videos of herself exercising alongside the hashtag #cancerslayer. In November 2023, she said she is committed to battling stage four breast cancer, which had now spread to her bones. Speaking to People magazine, Doherty said she was determined to keep going with treatment, adding: ""I'm not done with living. I'm not done with loving. I'm not done with creating.""",2024-07-14 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n1gdn4jkno,Unknown,2024-07-14 13:09:48,
371,America's Sweethearts: Netflix lifts lid on life as a cheerleader,"America’s Sweethearts, which lifts the lid on life in the most famous cheerleading team in the US, has been climbing up the Netflix charts since its release last month. The series follows the gruelling recruitment and coaching process for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders - DCC for short - and how much pressure the members face to be perfect. Among the hopefuls is 24-year-old Ariana McClure - a medical sales rep who moved to Dallas to pursue her dream. It is her second attempt at making the team, having been cut in training camp the previous year.  Dancers have to go through a tough audition process and training camp before they're high-kicking in formation on the football pitch, all without a piece of hair or false eyelash being out of place. It's ruthlessly competitive.  As well as learning the demanding acrobatic routines, they are required to stay the same size, so they can continue to fit in to the trademark uniform of tiny shorts, crop top and cowboy boots. It’s not the first show about the cheerleaders, who are nicknamed America’s Sweethearts – there had already been 16 seasons of a reality show about the team on US network CMT. But Netflix has brought DCC to a new audience. And many viewers have expressed shock at the demands on the cheerleaders, and the comparatively low wages they are paid. In addition to intense training, most of the women have other full-time jobs. In the opening episode, Cowboys boss Charlotte Jones admits the cheerleaders are ""not paid a lot"" – but says women on the team do not join for the pay, rather to be part of something bigger than themselves. Ariana thinks pay has slightly improved across the board, but still says the cheerleaders should be compensated better. ""I definitely [don’t think we have to earn] anything near what the football players are making,"" she tells the BBC. ""But I do think that these organisations have enough money. ""We like to say it's a part-time job with a full time schedule. Apart from just the hours of practising, it's also two hours beforehand, getting ready, you have to have your hair and make-up done. ""It's also finding time within the day to work out so that you stay in shape, not only physically but to make sure you can get through the routines."" She adds: ""We would all ultimately do it for free because we love it and it's our passion, but it is at the end of the day a job and they treat it as a job and so I think we should be rewarded for our work a little better - but it's getting there."" The series also touches on the mental health of the dancers. Four-year veteran Victoria Kalina – who has since left the team – spoke about struggling with depression and eating disorders while she was on the team. ""I applaud Victoria for being so brave to speak about it because it's a vulnerable thing and it's hard to speak about that and we all have the same thoughts,"" Ariana says. In order to cope with the pressure of training, Ariana started journalling and seeing a therapist. But she thinks, in order to help others, sports therapists should be offered to cheerleaders on NFL teams. ""My therapist was great, but she's not a dancer, or wasn't an athlete,"" she explains. ""And so having just some tools offered for the girls to talk to would be really beneficial."" A DCC spokesperson told the BBC that all chearleaders, like its football players, have access to ""immediate, independent and confidential support resources"". ""Also, just like our Cowboys players, they have access to our dedicated team Mental Health and Wellness Consultant on staff, as needed."" The women featured in the series have won praise from viewers and TV critics for how they face the exacting expectations. ""America’s Sweethearts is a disturbing show on many levels, but the resilience of its women is impressive,"" the Guardian said. Emma Beddington wrote that there is ""plenty to horrify"" in the series, including the physical toll on the team members' bodies, the ""abysmal pay"" and ""the objectification"". Time's Judy Berman wrote: ""At best, they’re athletes working at the apex of their sport; at worst, they’re casualties of a job market, a form of entertainment, and a society in which misogyny is so deeply ingrained, it’s often enforced by the women it oppresses."" Writing in the New York Times, Jessica Grose said: ""If there's another season of the Netflix show, perhaps a more complete picture of the Cowboys cheerleading experience could force this elite institution to evolve, and it may make more of these talented women reach the conclusion that making the team isn't worth the cost."" For Ariana, the experience ended when she was cut from training camp on the last day. She says she only found out why she was cut from the team while watching the show ""at the same time as everyone else"". In the emotional chat with director Kelli Finglass and choreographer Judy Trammel, Ari was told she was being dropped because there were only 36 spaces, without much further explanation. But earlier, Jones - the team's executive vice-president and daughter of owner Jerry - had told Kelli and Judy that Ariana looked like a ""little girl"" and ""left behind"" on the team, due to her 5ft 2in (1.57m) height. ""I found out details that I didn't know,"" she tells BBC News. ""And I think it allowed for me to not so much blame myself, not be so hard on myself - knowing it's the one thing God gave me that I can't change or fix."" There are no height restrictions for the team, with guidelines simply saying there are no height or weight requirements, and women are expected to ""look well-proportioned in dancewear"". After watching the show, does Ariana think there should have been a height restriction? ""Had I known even going in the first year that height was a concern, I probably wouldn't have tried out for Cowboys again,"" she says. ""I do think they need to install a height requirement. ""But I also I know that the team changes throughout the years, and the demographic of the team, and they may have more taller rookies, may have shorter rookies."" DCC were asked by the BBC to comment on the team not having a height restriction.  But Ariana's hard work hasn't gone to waste - she is about to start the season as a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins. ""It's nice, because the new director of the Dolphins squad was at the Cowboys, and so I knew her in Dallas for a little bit. ""And so a lot of the things I loved about Cowboys in that organisation, she's taking over to Dolphins - but it is the most mentally positive, happy environment I've been in.""",2024-07-14 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv548yny18o,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-14 02:09:48,
374,Spray of bullets shatters nation's illusion of security,"A spray of bullets may have only grazed Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, but they killed one rally attendee and critically wounded two others. They have also torn through the 2024 presidential campaign, damaging the social and cultural fabric of the nation. The illusion of security and safety in American politics – built over decades - has been dramatically shattered. Trump received only minor injuries but it was close - a photograph by Doug Mills of the New York Times appears to show the streak of a bullet cutting through the air near the former president’s head. Not since Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinkley Jr in 1981 has there been such a dramatic act of violence directed against a president - or presidential candidate. It harkens back to a darker time in US history, more than a half-century ago, when two Kennedy brothers – one a president and one a presidential candidate - were felled by assassin bullets. Civil rights leaders such as Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X all also lost their lives in political violence. Like today, the 1960s were marred by intense political polarisation and dysfunction, when a firearm and an individual willing to use it could change the course of history. It is difficult to predict the impact Saturday’s events will have on America - and its political discourse. Already, there have been some bipartisan calls for a cooling of rhetoric and national unity. Within hours of the incident, President Joe Biden – Trump’s likely opponent in November – appeared before cameras in Delaware to make a statement to the press. “There is no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick,” he said. “We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.” The president later spoke by phone with the former president. He cut short his weekend at the beach and is returning to the White House late Saturday evening. But the violence has also quickly filtered into the bare-knuckle partisan trench-warfare that has characterised American politics in recent decades. Some Republican politicians have laid the blame for the attack on Democrats who have employed dire rhetoric about the threat they say the former president poses to American democracy.  “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” Ohio Senator JD Vance, who is reportedly on the shortlist to be Trump’s vice-presidential pick, posted on social media. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s assassination attempt.” Chris LaCivita, the Trump campaign manager, said that “leftist activists, Democratic donors and even Joe Biden” need to be held accountable at the ballot box in November for “disgusting remarks” that in his view led to Saturday’s attack. Democrats may object, but many on the left used similar language to describe the culpability of right-wing rhetoric in the months before the 2011 near-fatal shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Arizona. The Pennsylvania violence will undoubtedly cast a long shadow over the Republican convention, which begins on Monday. Security protocols will be tightened, and the protests – and counter-protests – near the site could be accompanied by a new sense of foreboding. Meanwhile, an even brighter national spotlight will shine on the party’s nominee when he takes the stage on Thursday night. Images of the former president, bloodied, with an upraised fist are sure to become a rallying point in Milwaukee. The Republican Party was already planning to make strength and rugged masculinity a central theme, and Saturday’s incident will give that a jolt of new energy. “This is the fighter America needs!” Eric Trump wrote on social media, accompanied by a photograph of his father after the shooting. The US Secret Service will also face intense scrutiny for its handling of security at the Trump rally. An individual with a high-powered rifle was able to come within firing distance of a major presidential candidate.  Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is promising that his chamber will conduct a full inquiry. Those investigations will take time.  But for now, one thing is clear: in a year of uncharted electoral waters, America’s politics have taken a new, deadly turn.",2024-07-14 23:09:50,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vdq5wy4kwo,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-14 04:09:50,
375,"Zambia made education free, now classrooms are crammed","It’s 07:00 on a chilly winter morning and a group of students has just arrived at Chanyanya Primary and Secondary school, a little over an hour’s drive south-west    of Zambia’s capital, Lusaka. “You need to come early to school because there is a shortage of desks,” says 16-year-old pupil Richard Banda. “Two days ago I came late and I ended up sitting on the floor - it was so cold.” His discomfort encapsulates the problem of a lack of resources and overcrowding that has come as a result of offering free primary and secondary school education here. The school is in a compound made up of 10 classrooms arranged in a horseshoe shape around a playground where acacia trees and plants spring out of the sandy soil. The rays of the early-morning sun are caught in a cloud of dust stirred up by boys and girls sweeping the classrooms. Just before the bell rings, one of the students sprints to the middle of the playground and raises the Zambian flag atop a tall pole. These start-of-the-day rituals have become part of a new routine for two million extra children who since 2021 have been able to go to state-run schools without having to pay, because the government made schooling free for everyone. But without enough infrastructure investment, experts say overcrowding is now threatening the quality of education, especially for low-income students. “I stopped going to school in 2016 when I was in grade four,” says 18-year-old Mariana Chirwa donning the Chanyanya’s girls uniform, a light-blue shirt topped with a tartan bow. “Without free education I don’t know how my parents would have managed to take me back to school. They don’t work and just stay at home.” A poster of the class sizes hanging on the wall of the headteacher’s office spells out the challenge schools like Chanyanya face. In one of the classrooms, 75 boys and 85 girls are squeezed into a space that would comfortably fit only 30 pupils. “When I started in 2019 I had about 40 students, but now it’s around 100 plus, and that is just in one class,” says 33-year-old teacher Cleopatra Zulu. “Each and every day we receive new learners because of free education. Talking one-on-one is difficult, even marking is a challenge. We have even reduced the number of subjects that we are giving them”. The experience of pupil Richard Banda reflects this. “We don’t learn in the same way as those times when we used to pay, there’s a little bit of a difference,” he tells the BBC. “When we were few the teacher would explain a topic again if you didn’t understand, but now because we are many, the teacher doesn’t repeat it again. That’s the difference.” The uptick in the number of learners is reflected across sub-Saharan Africa with more children in school than ever before, the UN children’s agency Unicef says. But with nine out of 10 primary school students in the region still struggling to read and understand simple texts, according to Unicef, the focus for policy-makers is now shifting to the quality of the education, the hiring of qualified teachers and the physical infrastructure and resources. “When you don’t sit properly in a classroom, that affects the way that you pay attention to teaching, the way that you write your notes,"" says Aaron Chansa, the director of the National Action of Quality Education in Zambia (NAQEZ), which the government consults. ""We are seeing learners getting into secondary school when they can’t read properly,"" he says, adding that there are problems across the country. “In Eastern Province we have more than 100 learners in one class. This has also worsened the book-to-pupil ratio. In some instances you find one book being fought over by six or seven learners.” The government says it is listening and taking steps to address the challenges created by making education free. “This is a good problem,” says Education Minister Douglas Syakalima. “I’d rather let the children be in a congested classroom than in the street."" “The president launched mass production of desks, mass infrastructure-building is happening.” Zambia has invested over $1bn (£784m) in the education sector since the introduction of free education three years ago - a much-needed boost after years of decline in spending as a proportion of GDP in this sector. The government has announced plans to build over 170 new schools and has committed to the recruitment of 55,000 new teachers by the end of 2026, of whom 37,000 have already been hired. The move has provided fresh job opportunities, but it has also led to a shortage of accommodation in rural areas. Some teachers are reporting having to live in grass-thatched houses and share pit latrines, which are at risk of overflowing. “When it’s the rainy season here, you don’t really want to visit us,” says Ms Zulu, who lives in the school compound and remembers being nervous about the risk of cholera during the outbreak earlier this year. Just outside her house, a large patch of dried-up shower gel marks the spot where one of the residents bathed earlier, in the open, with privacy provided only by the darkness before sunrise. “The houses we live in are more like a death-trap,” says Ms Zulu. “The government should do something about the houses, especially the toilets.” Worried about learning outcomes, some families have quietly begun to take action. Robert Mwape is a taxi driver based in Lusaka. In 2022, he moved his 11-year-old son from a private, fee-paying school to a public one to take advantage of free education, but he soon came to regret the move. “I noticed [my son’s] results began going down. So one day I decided to visit the classroom. There were too many of them. You know what young people are like - so many of them, they waste time talking. The teacher couldn’t focus the entire class.” The following year Mr Mwape, who did not want us to use his real name, reversed his original decision. Now aged 13, his son is back at a private school. With Zambia slowly emerging from a debt default in 2020, some experts have cast doubt over the sustainability of the free education policy. A 2023 report from the Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis and Research says that if all eligible students take up the offer of free education, government expenditure is estimated to double, “raising questions on the commitment of subsequent governments to continue the policy”. But the education minister says he is confident the administration can shoulder the cost. “I don’t see [the challenge] myself. Education is the best economic policy, ” says Mr Syakalima. Making school free is widely seen as a first step towards giving young Zambians a fair chance to a brighter future. But the country’s experience so far shows the challenges of managing a growing number of students while trying to maintain the quality of the education they receive.

376,Thomas Matthew Crooks: What we know about the Trump attacker,"The small Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park in Pennsylvania is reeling after the FBI named a young local man, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as the person who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign rally and shocked the nation. Investigators believe that Crooks, armed with an AR-style rifle, opened fire at the former president while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania, leaving one audience member dead and two others critically wounded.  The 20-year-old kitchen worker was shot dead at the scene by a Secret Service sniper, officials said.  In his quiet and well-to-do hometown, however, neighbours are in shock, seemingly unable to grasp how a quiet young man is now accused in the shooting. The FBI, for its part, has said only that Crooks was the ""subject involved in the assassination attempt on the former president and that an active investigation was under way. Thomas Crooks had not been carrying ID, so investigators used DNA to identify him, the FBI said. He was from Bethel Park in Pennsylvania, about 70km (43 miles) from the site of the attempted assassination, and graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School with a $500 prize for maths and science, according to a local newspaper.  Crooks worked in a local nursing home kitchen just a short drive away from his home, the BBC understands. State voter records show that he was a registered Republican, according to US media. He is also reported to have donated $15 to liberal campaign group ActBlue in 2021. According to US media reports, Crooks was wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a YouTube channel known for its guns and demolition content. The channel has millions of subscribers featuring videos on different guns and explosive devices. Law enforcement officials believe the weapon used to shoot at Donald Trump was purchased by Crook's father, the Associated Press news agency reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity, two officers told AP that Crooks' father bought a weapon at least six months ago.  The day after the shooting, law enforcement sources also told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that suspicious devices were found in Crooks' vehicle. According to CBS, the suspect had a piece of commercially available equipment that appeared capable of initiating the devices.  Bomb technicians were called to the scene to secure and investigate the devices.  Having established Crooks's identity, police and agencies are investigating his motive. ""We do not currently have an identified motive,"" said Kevin Rojek, FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, at a briefing on Saturday night. The inquiry into what took place could last for months and investigators would work ""tirelessly"" to identify what Crooks' motive was, Mr Rojek said. Speaking to CNN, Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but would “wait until I talk to law enforcement” before speaking about his son.  Police sealed off the road to the house where Crooks lived with his parents, CBS News reports. A neighbour told CBS that officers evacuated her in the middle of the night with no warning. Bethel Park Police said there was a bomb investigation surrounding Crooks's home. Access to the area remains tightly controlled with police vehicles blocking the roads. Only residents have been allowed in or out.  Law enforcement sources told CBS that they believe some degree of planning ahead of the shooting.  How much time was spent in that planning, however, remains the subject of an ongoing investigation.  Police believe he acted alone, but are continuing to investigate whether he was accompanied to the rally.  So far, a confusing - and at times conflicting - picture has emerged of who Crooks was as a person.  Speaking to local news outlet KDKA, some young locals who went to school with him described him as a loner, who was frequently bullied and sometimes wore ""hunting outfits to school"".  Another former classmate of his, Summer Barkley, cast him differently, telling the BBC that he was ""always getting good grades on tests"" and was ""very passionate about history"".  ""Anything on government and history he seemed to know about,"" he said. ""But it was nothing out of the ordinary....he was always nice.""  Others simply remembered him as quiet.  ""He was there but I can't think of anyone who knew him well,"" one former classmate, who asked to remain nameless, told the BBC. ""He's just not a guy I really think about. But he seemed fine. Jameson Myers, a former member of the Bethel Park High School varsity rifle team who graduated alongside Crooks in 2022, told CBS that he did not make the team.  ""He did not even make the junior varsity team after trying out,"" Mr Myers added. ""He never returned to try-outs for the remainder of high school.""  Mr Myers remembers Crooks as seemingly a ""normal boy"" who was ""not particularly popular but never got picked on or anything.""  “He was a nice kid who never talked poorly of anyone and I never have thought him capable of anything I’ve seen him do in the last few days.”  A shooting club in the Pittsburgh area, the Clairton Sportmen's Club, later confirmed that Crooks was a member, although club president Bill Sellitto did not provide any more details.  Other community members said simply that they were shocked that the alleged perpetrator of the shooting could have come from the quiet, green streets of Bethel Park.  Among them was Jason Mackey, a 27-year-old local man who lives near the Crooks residence and worked at his school while he was a student.  While Mr Mackey said that he did not know Crooks personally, he is still reeling from a sense of disbelief.  ""It's just shocking. You wouldn't think an event of this magnitude would come right out of your backyard,"" he said. ""It's just a crazy situation."" One person was killed and two others were injured in the shooting.  All three victims are adult men and were audience members, CBS News reports.  At a news conference on Sunday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro identified the deceased victim at Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief who was killed when he ""dived on his family"" to protect them. He said that Comperatore ""died a hero"".  A GoFundMe page, organised by the Trump campaign's national finance director Meredith O'Rourke, was set up in the hours after the attack with donations going to the families of the injured. It has so far raised more than $340,000 (£267,000). In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear"" and said he felt the bullet ""ripping through the skin"". Blood was visible on Trump's ear and face as protection officers rushed him away. Trump is ""doing well"" and is grateful to law enforcement officers, according to a statement published on the Republican National Committee (RNC) website. One witness told the BBC that he had seen a man – believed to be Crooks - with a rifle on the roof of a building before Trump was shot.  Video footage obtained by TMZ shows the moment the shooting began. The assailant opened fire with “an AR-style rifle”, CBS News reports.  Law enforcement sources also told CBS that he was reported by a bystander and identified as a suspicious person by police, but that officers lost track of him before the shooting began.  However, the FBI says it did not immediately know what type of firearm was used or how many shots were fired. A Secret Service sniper returned fire and killed the gunman, the agency said.

377,Secret Service faces questions after Trump assassination attempt,"The Secret Service is facing questions after former US President Donald Trump was shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania.  Trump, who is now ""doing well"", says he was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds at a fairground in Butler.   One bystander was killed in the shooting and two others were critically injured, according to a Secret Service spokesman.  The Director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before the US House of Representatives on 22 July by the Oversight Committee - the main investigative board of the US House of Representatives.  At a news conference on Sunday, FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said it was ""surprising"" that the shooter, who has been named as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to open fire before the Secret Service killed him.  An investigation into the attempted assassination, which is already under way, involves the FBI, the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security. ""Americans demand answers about the assassination attempt of President Trump,"" the Oversight Committee said in a statement on social media. Trump was quickly bundled off stage and into a waiting vehicle after shots were fired just a few minutes into his speech at 18:11 local time on Saturday.  Blood could be seen near the former president's ear as he raised his fist to the crowd.  In a post to his Truth Social network, Trump said a bullet pierced the ""upper part"" of his right ear.  ""I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,"" Trump wrote.  ""Much bleeding took place, so I realised then what was happening."" The FBI said it is treating the incident as an assassination attempt on Trump and it is an ""active and ongoing investigation"". The suspect was shot dead at the scene by a US Secret Service sniper, said the agency's spokesperson, Anthony Guglielmi.  He added that the one bystander killed in the shooting, and the two others critically injured, were all male. Their identities have not been released.  Law enforcement sources told CBS News that Crooks had been armed with ""an AR-style rifle"" and had fired from a building a few hundred metres from the venue.  Special Agent Kevin Rojek said Crooks had not been carrying ID and that investigators used DNA to identify him. They have yet to identify a motive for the assassination attempt, he added. State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican, according to US media reports.  He is also reported to have donated $15 to a liberal campaign group in 2021. A senior adviser to Donald Trump's campaign said there are questions about how prepared the Secret Service was. Speaking to the BBC World Service, Stephen Moore called it a ""scary day"". ""Certainly Trump needs more protection - there’s a lot of inquiry now about whether the Secret Service was totally prepared,"" Mr Moore said.  However, Mr Guglielmi says there is an ""untrue assertion"" circulating that someone on Trump's security team had requested extra security ""resources"" and that request was ""rebuffed"". ""This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources and technology and capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo,"" Mr Guglielmi said.  Trump had just started addressing his supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania - a crucial swing state in November's election - when the shots started.  Multiple bangs rang out as Trump spoke about his successor, President Joe Biden, and his administration.  Several supporters holding placards and standing behind Trump ducked as the shots were heard.  Bystanders who spoke to the BBC suggested the gunshots may have come from a one-storey building to the right of the stage where Trump was speaking. One witness - Greg - told the BBC that he had spotted a suspicious-looking person ""bear crawling"" on the roof of the building about five minutes after Trump took to the stage. He said he pointed the person out to police.  ""He had a rifle, we could clearly see him with a rifle,"" he said. ""We’re pointing at him, the police are down there running around on the ground – we’re like ‘hey man there’s a guy on the roof with a rifle’ and the police did not know what was going on."" Tim - who was also at the rally - told the BBC that he had heard a ""barrage"" of shots.  ""There was a spray which we initially thought was a fire hose, and then the speaker on the right-hand side started coming down,"" he said.  ""Something must have hit the hydraulic lines [which caused it to fall]. We saw President Trump go to the ground and everyone started dropping to the ground because it was chaos."" Warren and Debbie were at the venue and told the BBC they heard at least four gunshots. They said they both got on the ground as Secret Service agents came through the crowd, shouting for the attendees to get down. People remained calm, they said. ""We couldn't believe it was happening,"" Warren said. Debbie said a little girl beside them was crying that she didn't want to die and saying ""how is this happening to us?"" ""That broke my heart,"" Debbie said. Republican Congressman Ronnie Jackson told the BBC that his nephew was injured in the shooting. He sustained a minor wound to his neck and was treated at the scene, Mr Jackson said in a statement.  Speaking from his home state of Delaware, President Biden deplored the attack, calling it ""sick"".  ""There's no place in America for this kind of violence,"" he said. ""Everybody must condemn it."" The White House later said President Biden had spoken with Trump before returning to Washington DC.  Trump remains locked in a tight contest with President Biden - the presumptive Democratic nominee - in a re-match of the 2020 election.  Politicians of both parties joined Mr Biden in condemning the apparent attack.  Former President Barack Obama said there ""is absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy"" and that he was ""relieved that former President Trump wasn’t seriously hurt"".  Trump's former vice-president Mike Pence said he and his wife were praying for his former ally, adding that he urged ""every American to join us"".  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement: “My thoughts and prayers are with former President Trump. I am thankful for the decisive law enforcement response. America is a democracy. Political violence of any kind is never acceptable.” UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer led international condemnation of the shooting, saying he was ""appalled by the shocking scenes at President Trump's rally"".  ""Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack,"" he said in a statement. Trump is still set to accept his party's nomination for president at the convention in Milwaukee on Monday, his campaign managers said. Some had speculated that he had been set to reveal his running mate at the Butler rally. Some Republicans were quick to blame President Biden over the shooting, accusing him of stoking fears about Trump's potential return to office.  Senator JD Vance, who is thought to be on the shortlist to become Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, said the rhetoric from the Biden campaign had led directly to this incident. Mike Collins - a Republican congressman - accused the president of “inciting an assassination”. Meanwhile James Comer, the chair of the powerful House oversight committee, said he would summon the director of the Secret Service before his panel.

379,EU says X’s blue tick accounts deceive users,"Elon Musk's social media site X has been accused by the European Union of breaching its online content rules, with its ""verified"" blue tick accounts having the potential to ""deceive"" users. The bloc's tech regulator said users could be duped into thinking the identity of those with blue tick marks was verified, when in fact anybody can pay for a blue tick. It said it had found evidence of ""malicious actors"" abusing the system. The investigation began under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA).  It could lead to X being fined up to 6% of its global annual turnover and being forced to change how it operates in the bloc.  Mr Musk reacted angrily: ""The DSA is misinformation,"" he wrote on X. The billionaire, who bought the platform for $44bn in 2022, said the DSA rules amounted to ""censored speech"" which he said he found unacceptable. X chief executive Linda Yaccarino also defended the company's practices.  ""A democratised system, allowing everyone across Europe to access verification, is better than just the privileged few being verified,"" she wrote on the social media site.  The findings follow a seven month investigation under the DSA.  The law, which was introduced in 2022, requires big tech firms, like X, to take action to stop illegal content and safeguard the public. ByteDance's TikTok, AliExpress and Meta Platforms are also being investigated under the act. The Commission said its review of X had found a lack of transparency around advertising and that X did not provide data for research use as required under EU rules. ""In particular, X prohibits eligible researchers from independently accessing its public data, such as by scraping, as stated in its terms of service"", the Commission said. The tech regulator also said that the way X designed and operated its interface for blue tick verified accounts did ""not correspond to industry practice and deceives users"". ""Since anyone can subscribe to obtain such a 'verified' status, it negatively affects users' ability to make free and informed decisions about the authenticity of the accounts and the content they interact with,"" it said. ""There is evidence of motivated malicious actors abusing the 'verified account' to deceive users,"" it added. The Commission said X could defend itself against the findings or resolve the issue by committing to changes that would bring it into compliance.  Any such deal would be made public, it added, in response to Mr Musk's claim that the commission had offered an ""illegal secret deal"".  ""Back in the day, BlueChecks used to mean trustworthy sources of information,"" Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said. ""Now with X, our preliminary view is that they deceive users and infringe the DSA.""  ""X has now the right of defence - but if our view is confirmed, we will impose fines and require significant changes."" The Commission pushed back against Mr Musks's charge of censorship, saying its rules were aimed at ensuring ""a safe and fair online environment for European citizens that is respectful of their rights, in particular freedom of expression"". Among its rules, it said, are requirements that companies inform users when their accounts are restricted and that users who are banned can contest those decisions.  The Commission said it was continuing investigations into X's practices around dissemination of illegal content, and how well it combats the spread of fake news.",2024-07-14 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0y1ezpv5xo,"Faarea Masud,",2024-07-12 23:09:51,
380,Five jailed for Ecuador presidential candidate's murder,"Five people linked to one of Ecuador's biggest criminal gangs have been jailed for the murder of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio last year.  Mr Villavicencio, a member of the country's national assembly and an ex-journalist, was shot dead as he left a campaign rally in the capital, Quito, last August.  Carlos Angulo, the alleged leader of the Los Lobos gang, and Laura Castilla were sentenced to 34 years and eight months in prison for directing the hit.  Two men and a woman were handed 12-year sentences by the court in Quito for aiding a hit squad in the attack.  Prosecutors alleged that Angulo - widely known as The Invisible - ordered the hit from the Quito prison in which he is detained.  He denied the charges, claiming he was being made a ""scapegoat"" for the hit.  Castilla was left in charge of logistics for the hit. She allegedly supplied weapons, money and motorcycles to the men to carry out the hit. The others - Erick Ramirez, Victor Flores and Alexandra Chimbo - were accused of helping the hit squad track Mr Villavicencio's movements.  More than 70 people gave evidence during the trial, including a key witness who said the gang had been offered more than $200,000 (£154,000) to kill Mr Villavicencio. A crusading anti-corruption activist, Mr Villavicencio had been one of the few candidates to allege links between organised crime and government officials in Ecuador. In the weeks leading up to the election, the politician had received death threats and been given a security detail. But he continued to campaign and was gunned down by a group of assailants on 9 August outside a school in the north of Quito. Prosecutors said during the trial that one of the men involved in the assassination was shot dead in a confrontation with police at the scene.  Six other men - all Colombian nationals - were later arrested in connection with the killing, but were subsequently found murdered at El Litoral prison, where they were being held in pre-trial detention. A separate investigation into who contracted Los Lobos to carry out the hit remains ongoing, prosecutors have said.  Mr Villavicencio's widow, Veronica Sarauz, welcomed the ruling. But she said it only marked the beginning of a long road to determine the entire story behind her husband's death.  Ecuador has historically been a relatively safe and stable country in Latin America, but crime has shot up in recent years, fuelled by the growing presence of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels, which have infiltrated local criminal gangs. The Los Lobos gang led by Angulo is said to have deep connections to the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel in Mexico.

381,Rwanda's 99% man who wants to extend his three decades in power,"There is very little room for improvement for Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame in Monday’s election after getting almost 99% of the vote last time round. The scale of his victory in 2017, along with his 95% in 2003 and 93% in 2010, raised some questions about how truly democratic the elections were. Criticism that the former refugee and rebel leader confidently bats away. “There are those who think 100% is not democracy,” Mr Kagame told thousands of cheering supporters at a campaign rally in western Rwanda last month. Referring to elections elsewhere, without naming a specific country, he added: “There are many who are voted in office with 15%... Is that democracy? How?” What happens in Rwanda is Rwanda’s business, the president insisted. His backers agreed, chanting “they should come and learn” as they waved the red, white and sky blue flags of the governing Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) party. At over 6ft (1.83m), the wiry 66-year-old father of four cuts a stern and imposing figure amid the crowds. He can crack a smile and a joke or two, but the bespectacled leader can often take on the grimace of a disappointed elder. His soft, thoughtful delivery forces the listener to take note and when he speaks he is usually very direct, rarely mincing his words. Even on the occasions when he deploys more cryptic or diplomatic language, he will use insinuation to let people know what he is talking about. Mr Kagame's life has been shaped by the conflict between Rwanda's Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups. In order to overcome this, his government now insists that people identify as Rwandans rather than with a specific ethnic group. President since 2000, he is running for a fourth term, but Mr Kagame has been the real leader of the East African country ever since July 1994. This is when his rebel army ousted the Hutu extremist government which had orchestrated the genocide of that year. He initially served as vice-president and defence minister. Many of his supporters, among them some leading Western politicians, praise him for bringing stability and rebuilding Rwanda after the mass slaughter in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. Some accuse his then rebel army of revenge killings at the time, but his government has consistently said they were isolated instances and that those responsible were punished. The president is not backward when it comes to criticising the West, but he also tries to secure its backing by sometimes playing on the guilt over the failure to prevent the genocide. Rwanda was also a partner and a financial beneficiary in a now-junked UK scheme to send asylum seekers to the country. “I will vote for PK, of course,” says university student Marie Jeanne, referring to Mr Kagame by his initials. “Look at how I am studying well. If he was not president, I might not study well maybe due to lack of security,” she tells the BBC. For her, the answer to who she would vote for was obvious, but there are two other names on the ballot paper for the nine million registered voters to consider. The Democratic Green Party’s Frank Habineza and independent Philippe Mpayimana are both running again, in a repeat of the presidential election seven years ago. However, last time round they got just over 1% of votes between them. Other political parties have backed Mr Kagame for president. Opposition politician Diane Rwigara, an outspoken critic of Mr Kagame, was barred from taking part on the grounds that she did not present the correct paperwork, which she dismissed as an excuse to stop her running. Mr Kagame has also been accused of silencing, through imprisonment and intimidation, other potential opponents. He once told the Al Jazeera news channel  he should not be held responsible for a weak opposition. His powerful network of spies has allegedly carried out a spate of cross-border assassinations and abductions. They are alleged to have even targeted their own former boss, ex-intelligence chief Col Patrick Karegeya, who fled Rwanda after falling out with Mr Kagame. He was murdered in 2014 in his suite at an upmarket hotel in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg. ""They literally used a rope to hang him tight,"" said David Batenga, Col Karegeya's nephew. Mr Kagame did little to distance himself from the killing, while officially denying any involvement. ""You can't betray Rwanda and not get punished for it,"" he told a prayer meeting shortly afterwards. ""Anyone, even those still alive, will reap the consequences. Anyone. It is a matter of time."" The president's pursuit of security at home has led him to send troops into neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, saying they are pursuing a Hutu rebel group. Rwanda is also accused of backing the M23 rebel group there - something which it denies, despite a wealth of evidence, including in a recent UN report. “Really to be honest, [the election] is a farce,” says Filip Reyntjens reflecting on the poll. The Belgian political scientist is an expert on the Great Lakes region. “Of course I don’t know what will happen this time, but previous elections have been… a circus. “I mean the national electoral commission attributes votes rather than counting votes,” he alleges, citing the last European Union (EU) observer mission report of 2003 and the Commonwealth observer mission report of 2010. Rwanda’s electoral commission says on its website that it conducts “free, fair and transparent elections to promote democracy and good governance in Rwanda”. “To me, the upcoming presidential election in Rwanda is a non-event,” says Dr Joseph Sebarenzi, a former speaker of the Rwandan parliament, who lost parents and many family members during the genocide, and now lives in exile in the US. “The election is like a football game where the organiser is also a competitor, selects other competitors, orders people to attend the game, and where everyone knows the pre-determined winner but must behave as if the game is real.” Mr Kagame, a keen football fan who closely follows English Premier League club Arsenal, would reject this description. Born in 1957 into a well-to-do household in central Rwanda, he was the youngest of five children. But, barely two years old, he became a refugee in neighbouring Uganda, fleeing the persecution and pogroms of the late 1950s with his family and thousands of others from the minority Tutsi population. Despite being just an infant at the time, Mr Kagame has said he can still “remember looking out onto the next hill. We could see people burning the houses there.  ""They were killing people. My mother was so desperate. She didn’t want to leave this place,” the president told American journalist and unofficial biographer Stephen Kinzer. These killings came after Belgian colonisers switched which ethnic group they backed, to favour an emerging ruling elite from the majority Hutu ethnic group, some of whom had suffered ill-treatment under the Tutsi monarchy. Rwanda gained independence in 1962. In the late 1970s, Mr Kagame made a series of clandestine visits back home. While in the capital, Kigali, he frequented a particular hotel in Kiyovu, one of the city’s wealthiest neighbourhoods. Its bar was popular with politicians, security officers and civil servants who gossiped as they sipped their beer after work. Mr Kinzer wrote that the future leader would listen in to their conversations as he drank an orange soda sitting alone at a table and avoiding attention. These visits to his homeland sharpened his interest in the art of espionage. He trained in military intelligence in Uganda and joined the successful rebellion in that country led by Yoweri Museveni that saw him take power in 1986. Mr Kagame further trained in Tanzania, Cuba and the US. He then led his mainly Tutsi rebel army which marched into Rwanda in 1990. “[The training] was useful. Cuba, in its wars with the US and connection to Russia, was quite advanced in matters of intelligence. There was also political education: The struggle is about what? How do you sustain it?” he told Mr Kinzer. He has sought to sustain the struggle by targeting economic development - Mr Kagame suggested Rwanda would emulate Singapore or South Korea and achieve development in a generation. Although Rwanda fell short of its middle-income country target by 2020, Prof Reyntjens says “this is a well-run country”. “The problem in Rwanda is with political governance, there is no level playing-field, there is no space for opposition, there is no freedom of speech, [which] risks undoing the achievements of good technocratic governance.” But Mr Kagame maintains the huge crowds of supporters at his rallies are just one example of the trust and love Rwandans have for him and their wish that he continue as their leader, although he once said he would have groomed a successor by 2017. Because of constitutional changes, he could, in theory, remain in power until 2034. “The context of every country” matters, Mr Kagame said in a live interview on the state broadcaster last month, addressing the issue of his time in power. “[The West says]: ‘Oh you have been there too long’. But that’s none of your business. It’s the business of these people here.” Thousands of miles away in the US, Dr Sebarenzi says he does not know what the future holds for his home country, affectionately known as the land of a thousand hills, but adds: “History shows that in countries where the head of state is stronger than state institutions, change of power can turn violent, leading to chaotic post-regime periods.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with the option of a further 12 months.  Zirkzee's Bologna contract included a 40m euros (£33.6m) release clause, but United opted to agree a slightly increased price in order to pay the fee over a three-year period to help with Profit and Sustainability Rules. Zirkzee becomes the first signing the men's side have made since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became co-owner by purchasing a 27.7% stake in the club last December.  He scored 12 goals in 37 appearances last season as Serie A side Bologna claimed a surprise spot in this season's Champions League. Zirkzee joined Bayern Munich from Feyenoord in 2017, before moving to Bologna for about £7.15m five years later after loan spells with Parma and Anderlecht. He was named in Ronald Koeman's Euro 2024 squad but made just two substitute appearances for the Netherlands, who lost to England in the semi-finals. How good a signing is Zirkzee?

The Three Lions were beaten 2-1 by Spain in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin on Sunday. Southgate, 53, has been in charge since 2016 but his current contract is due to expire in December.  Asked about his future, Southgate told the BBC: ""Now is not the time for me to speak about that. I need to talk to the right people and give myself a bit of time.

Under Southgate, England have reached back-to-back European finals as well as the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the last eight of the 2022 World Cup. He faced criticism in Germany this month despite England progressing to the knockout stages as group winners.  Plastic cups were aimed at Southgate by supporters following their 0-0 draw with Slovenia in the group stage. ""The players will take enormous credit for getting us to where we did but when you’re as close as that, you have to take your chance,"" Southgate told ITV. ""They have represented the shirt with pride and haven’t been beaten until the very end. I just think Spain had more control of the game. ""England are in a really good position in terms of the experience they have. Most of this squad will be around for the next World Cup and maybe the next Euros.  ""There’s a lot to look forward to but at this moment, it’s not any consolation."" England captain Harry Kane said the players ""love the manager"" and they ""wanted so badly to win it for him"" having also suffered defeat against Italy three years ago. They have become the first nation in Euros history to lose successive finals, while Southgate is the first manager to end up on the losing side twice.  ""I suspect it will be Southgate's last game,"" former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC One.  ""There will be great disappointment at home. They could have played more attacking football but they got to the final. But when you are there, you have got to get over the line.

Jones spent eight seasons in the NFL and played a key role as the Ravens won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. In helping Baltimore to that victory over the San Francisco 49ers, he set a number of records. His 108-yard kick-off return for a touchdown is the longest in Super Bowl history, and the longest play ever in the showpiece game. Jones was also the first player to catch a touchdown and score on a return in the same Super Bowl. Drafted in the third round in 2007, Jones played for the Houston Texans until 2011 when he joined the Ravens. After three seasons in Baltimore, where he was selected for the Pro Bowl in 2012, he had spells at the San Diego Chargers and Pittsburgh Steelers before retiring in 2017. ""Jacoby was one of the most fun-loving team-mates and people I've ever been around,"" former Texans team-mate JJ Watt wrote on X. ""Always dancing and laughing, with a permanent smile on his face. Gone far, far too soon. R.I.P Jacoby Jones."" Torrey Smith, who played with Jones in Baltimore, wrote on X: ""My brother! I thank God for the memories and your impact on this world. ""You were 1 of 1! Your play on the field and jokes will live on forever! We have Momma Jones a Lil Coby's back for life! This one hurt me man! We are going to miss you! Love you bro!"" Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, also on X, added: ""Na bra no way. RIP LEGEND.""

383,'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph,"This video can not be played All the angles of Yamal's 'unbelievable goal' Breaking Pele's 66-year-old record and achieving things Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could only have dreamed of at his age. It is fair to say Lamine Yamal has shaken up the game of football in the past year - and he reached the pinnacle on Sunday as he became the youngest player to win a European Championship or World Cup - at the age of 17 years and one day. The Barcelona winger set up Nico Williams' opener in their 2-1 Euro 2024 final win over England - and forced Jordan Pickford into two fine saves. Nobody was involved in more Euro 2024 goals than Yamal - with one goal and four assists. Nobody has set up more goals in a single European Championship since records began in 1980. And nobody has ever been directly involved in goals in a quarter-final, semi-final and final before Yamal achieved the feat. Unsurprisingly, he was named the tournament's Young Player of the Tournament. ""I am very happy, this is a dream,"" said Yamal. ""I'm looking forward to returning to Spain and celebrating with all the fans. It's the best birthday present ever."" Former England defender Rio Ferdinand said the teenager was a ""sensation"" and an ""elite player"".  ""He was a star before this tournament, but he's a superstar now,"" he added. In the last few weeks Yamal became the youngest person to play at the Euros, to assist a goal at the Euros and to score a goal at the Euros. It is not just potential, he is already one of the most exciting players in the world. Former Spain midfielder Juan Mata, working on BBC One, said: ""I was having dinner yesterday with [Barcelona boss] Xavi and he told me he hasn't seen a player of this quality."" That is the Xavi who played alongside the legendary Messi at Barcelona. ""I don't like to make comparisons between players or compare them with Messi, but I think the sky is the limit for this kid,"" added Mata. So what has Barcelona winger Yamal, who turned 17 on Saturday, achieved so far in his career - and why is it so special? 'A superstar is born' - Yamal's history making moment of 'genius' 'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 England Before turning 17, Yamal had played 51 times for Barcelona, scoring seven goals and setting up another seven. For Spain he now has 14 appearances, three goals and seven assists. By comparison, neither Argentina's Messi nor Portugal's Ronaldo - the two greatest players of this generation - had played a single first-team game for club or country when they were 16.  And when we look at the players expected to replace Messi and Ronaldo as Ballon d'Or rivals in the future - France's Kylian Mbappe and Norway's Erling Haaland - their stats at this age cannot compare to Yamal either. Mbappe had played four games for Monaco, making one assist before turning 17, while Haaland had played 23 times in Norway for second-tier Bryne and top-flight Molde, scoring once. Even one of the most famous players to make their breakthrough at 16, Wayne Rooney, had only played 10 times for Everton and scored three goals before reaching 17. Not all of Yamal's appearances have come aged 16... because he was even younger when he made his Barcelona debut.  At 15 years and 290 days he became Barcelona's youngest player in the La Liga era when he replaced Gavi with six minutes to go in a 4-0 win over Real Betis on 29 April 2023. On 20 August, aged 16 years and 38 days, he became the youngest player since 1939 to start a La Liga game when he lined up in a 2-0 win over Cadiz. Just a week later he became the youngest player to assist a La Liga goal in the 21st century when he crossed for Gavi to head in during a 4-3 win at Villarreal. He became the youngest player to start a game in the Champions League, at 16 and 83 days, in a 1-0 win at Porto on 4 October. Four days later he became the youngest goalscorer in La Liga history when he netted in the first half of a 2-2 draw at Granada. He became the youngest player to play in El Clasico, the youngest to set up a Champions League goal, aged 16 years and 153 days at Antwerp, and the youngest player and scorer in the Spanish Super Cup. Yamal also became the youngest player to score in the Spanish Cup this century, the youngest to score twice in a La Liga game, the youngest player in a Champions League knockout game and then a quarter-final. Unsurprisingly he is the youngest player to make 50 appearances for Barcelona and the youngest to play 10 Champions League games. Even Yamal could not match the records of Armand Martinez Sagi, though. He was Barcelona's youngest ever player and scorer at the age of 14 in the Catalan Championship in 1920 - nine years before Spain had a national league. Among the few major records he has missed out on are youngest player in the Champions League (Youssoufa Moukoko was 16 years and 18 days for Borussia Dortmund against Zenit St Petersburg in 2020) or La Liga (Luka Romero was 15 years and 219 days old when he appeared for Mallorca against Real Madrid in 2020). He has yet to net in the Champions League and will not have the chance to break Ansu Fati's record as youngest scorer, aged 17 years and 40 days for Barcelona against Inter Milan in 2019, in that tournament now. This video can not be played 'The next superstar' - pundits praise Yamal On 8 September 2023, Yamal became Spain's youngest player and goalscorer in the same game - a 7-1 win over Georgia in Euro 2024 qualifying. He was aged 16 years and 57 days when he replaced Dani Olmo just before half-time. That was before he had even scored for Barcelona. Only Martin Odegaard, who was 15 years and 300 days when he played for Norway in 2014, has been younger while playing a European Championship qualifier. In this summer's finals, Yamal has broken nearly every record there is to break - even though he has been doing school homework during some of his downtime in Germany. He became the first 16-year-old to play at a men's Euros when he started their group opener against Croatia. Yamal also set up Dani Carvajal's goal for 3-0 in that game, making him the youngest to assist in Euros history. In the semi-final against France he became the youngest goalscorer in European Championship history - aged 16 years and 362 days. In that game he passed two Pele landmarks that have stood since 1958 - the youngest player to score at a Euros or World Cup - and the youngest to feature in the semi-finals of either. And then he broke Pele's record as the youngest player in either final. The only quirky milestone he missed out on was the chance to become the first 16-year-old and the first 17-year-old to score at a Euros. He turned 17 the day before the final - and the previous youngest Euros goalscorer was Johan Vonlanthen at the age of 18. Since his debut in September 2023, Yamal has been involved in more goals for Spain than anyone else (three goals, seven assists) Allow Instagram content?

382,'An annihilation - Alcaraz always had the answers',"This video can not be played Highlights: Alcaraz beats Djokovic in straight sets to retain Wimbledon title Did anyone expect that? Carlos Alcaraz's victory over Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final may not have been a huge surprise, but the way it played out certainly was. In the build-up, there was talk of a repeat of last year's final - an almighty tussle that went the full five sets. And when the first game of the match lasted 14 minutes, with Djokovic eventually surrendering his serve, many felt it would be more of the same. But Alcaraz flipped the script, racing through the first two sets, taking advantage of an off-colour Djokovic and never allowing the 24-time major champion to raise his level as he won 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-4). ""It was an annihilation. Alcaraz was phenomenal,"" former British number one Tim Henman said on BBC TV. ""The tone was set in the first game. Alcaraz was relentless and gave Djokovic nothing to get his teeth stuck into. ""Alcaraz always had the answers. The first set wasn't even close. When he needed it most in the tie-break, it was like Djokovic blinked."" Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said it was ""a perfect performance"", describing it as a ""breathtaking type of tennis on the biggest stage there is"". At 21, Alcaraz is a four-time major champion, and has won the French Open and Wimbledon in the space of five weeks. ""Alcaraz will carry our sport a long way,"" said Nick Kyrgios - runner-up at Wimbledon in 2022. ""The biggest enemy he'll have is his body. How healthy can he stay? ""I think he'll have upwards of 15 Slams, for sure."" Alcaraz crushes Djokovic to retain Wimbledon title 'Best day of my life' - Hewett wins singles and doubles 'Nobody will believe I won Wimbledon - I still can't' The only sign of nerves Alcaraz showed was when he dropped three championship points at 5-4 in the third set. But an otherwise flawless performance underscored why the Spaniard became only the eighth player to win the first four Grand Slam men's singles finals of his career. He is just the second in the Open Era, which began in 1968, to achieve the feat after Roger Federer, who won the first seven Slam finals he contested. Alcaraz is the ninth man in the Open Era to retain his Wimbledon title and the sixth to triumph at the French Open and All England Club in the same year. At 21 years and 70 days, he is the youngest player in the Open Era to do the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in the same calendar year. The Spaniard is also the third-youngest player in the Open Era to retain his Wimbledon title, following Boris Becker (18 years, 227 days) and Bjorn Borg (21 years, 26 days). Djokovic, arguably the greatest ever when it comes to performing under pressure, was quick to praise the Spaniard's performance. ""Overall the way I felt on the court today against him, I was inferior,"" said Djokovic. ""That's it. He was a better player. He played every single shot better than I did. I don't think I could have done much more. He was playing with a lot of variety. He really outplayed me."" Alcaraz, for his part, remains focused on the future. ""At the end of my career, I want to sit at the same table as the big guys. That's my main goal,"" he said. ""That's my dream right now. It doesn't matter if I already won four Grand Slams at the age of 21. ""If I'm not keeping going, all these tournaments for me, it doesn't matter."" Allow Instagram content?

Djokovic has only lost three of his 10 Wimbledon finals - and two of those have been to Alcaraz. He has won a major on all three surfaces and, perhaps most ominously for his rivals, the Slams seem to bring out his most tenacious qualities. He has an astonishing 12-1 record in fifth sets, having not lost one since the 2022 Australian Open when he was just starting to break through, and he came back from two sets to one down at both Wimbledon and Roland Garros. His big-hitting is suited to hard courts, he has the movement for the clay and the touch for grass-court success. However, he has struggled with injury in recent years. The Spaniard missed the end-of-season 2022 ATP Finals because of an abdominal problem and the Australian Open a few months later with a hamstring issue. ""The one enemy in Alcaraz's career so far has been injuries,"" said Kyrgios. ""This is only his eighth event this year, so if he's able to get on top of that and find what works for his body, nothing is going to be able to stop him in my eyes."" With attention now turning to the Olympics, on the Paris clay where Alcaraz won his third Slam, many will be wondering who will challenge him for the title. With Djokovic in the latter part of his career, eyes shift to younger players, with Henman citing Italy's Jannik Sinner, Denmark's Holger Rune and American Ben Shelton as having the potential to challenge Alcaraz. ""There's plenty who are going to want to stand up - Jannik Sinner is the world number one right now and they have a great rivalry ahead of them,"" Henman said. ""But for me Alcaraz's variety, the strings to his bow that he's able to utilise on every surface, is a pleasure to watch."" Alcaraz said: ""I think it is good for tennis to have new faces winning the big things and fighting for the big tournaments. ""I think it's great for the sport and I think for the players as well.""",2024-07-14 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c51y2vn643yo,Amy Lofthouse,2024-07-14 20:09:52,
387,Defeat extends England's '58 years of hurt',"This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 England England failed to end '58 years of hurt' as their Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain in Berlin meant the 1966 World Cup remains their only men's trophy. For the fourth game in a row England came from behind, but this time they fell short with Mikel Oyarzabal scoring a late winner to snatch a 2-1 victory. Nico Williams' strike early in the second half put Spain ahead but Cole Palmer's brilliant leveller looked set to send the game into extra time before Oyarzabal pounced four minutes from time. This was the second European Championship final in a row that Gareth Southgate's side have lost, after falling to Italy on penalties in 2021, with 1966 their only major tournament final before that. The country has yet to win senior football tournament abroad, with the 1966 success and Women's Euro 2022 final - which England won - both at Wembley. Southgate's contract runs until the end of the year so this could prove to be his final major tournament after eight years in charge. England started slowly in Germany, with performances criticised and the Three Lions close to elimination twice, but the past two rounds gave England fans cause to dream - until losing to Spain, the outstanding team throughout this Euros. This video can not be played Gifs, Tricks & World Cup bliss: 1966 cup final social re-fix When England won their home World Cup in 1966, beating West Germany 4-2 in the final with Geoff Hurst scoring a hat-trick, many fans may not have imagined that would remain their only success for at least 60 years. Since then a combined 29 men's World Cups and European Championships have passed and, until 2021, they had never been back to a final. England fans dwelled on the agonising near misses in the knockout stages of major tournaments - Diego Maradona's handball in 1986, losses on penalties to Germany in 1990 and 1996. Current boss Southgate missed a penalty in the latter too. And there were all the years they did not even get close, failing to qualify for the 1994 World Cup and 2008 Euros - and a few group-stage exits - too. It felt as if all that may change in 2021 when England reached the final in the continent-wide Euro 2020, although most of their games were at Wembley, including the showpiece against Italy. They took an early lead but ended up losing on penalties after extra time. Having waited 55 years for that final, it is a fine achievement by Southgate and his team that the next one followed just three years later. But this one too ended in tears. The Lionesses won the 2022 European Championship, beating Germany 2-1, also at Wembley.  This video can not be played 'Unusual environment' around England - Southgate It is fair to describe England's Euro 2024 campaign as a slow burner. A win over Serbia was followed by drab draws against Denmark and Slovenia in the group stage. Had the Danes netted a late winner in their final group game against Serbia, England would have finished second - and arguably had a tougher route to the final. Some England fans threw cups at Southgate after that disappointing Slovenia result and memes flooded social media showing the manager in various overly cautious scenarios. The Slovakia game in the last 16 was not much better in terms of performance and they were set to be eliminated until Jude Bellingham's injury-time overhead kick sent it to extra time - with Harry Kane then netting the winner. Some supporters still called for Southgate to be sacked after that game - something Ivory Coast did with their coach during this year's Africa Cup of Nations on their way to winning the tournament. But the mood seemed to lift when he changed from a back four to a wing-back system against Switzerland in the quarter-finals. They were 10 minutes from elimination before Bukayo Saka struck and his side went on to win on penalties. They trailed yet again in the semi-final against the Netherlands but Ollie Watkins netted in the 90th minute to send the Three Lions to another final. The latter two displays were not amazing, and did involve spells where they went into their shells, but it was still a far cry from those early matches. Euros fever grew across England - and Germany - as thousands of fans travelled just to be near to the action, but they are coming home without the trophy. This video can not be played England fans surround 'Bellingham bus', after spotting destination There were no Hurst-style hat-trick heroics - but there are still plenty of names who will go down in English footballing folklore. Chelsea's Palmer became just the fourth player to score in a men's final for England after Hurst, Martin Peters and Luke Shaw. Bayern Munich striker Kane, still without a first trophy of a goal-laden career, netted three goals, extending his record as England's all-time top scorer, to secure  a share of the Golden Boot. Real Madrid's Bellingham scored twice - including his amazing last-gasp equaliser against Slovakia.  That boosted Bellingham's chances of winning the Ballon d'Or, having won the Champions League and La Liga in his first season with Real too. All five goals were crucial with England never winning a game by more than one goal. Aston Villa striker Watkins did not have a lot of game time - but he had one of their greatest moments with a neat turn and finish in the final minute of the Dutch semi-final. Arsenal winger Saka netted a late equaliser against Switzerland in the quarters, and in the resulting shootout - a cathartic moment for a player who missed a penalty in the 2021 final. Everton keeper Jordan Pickford's save from Swiss defender Manuel Akanji's spot-kick also set them up for that shootout success as it was the only one missed of nine taken. Southgate's contract runs out at the end of this year - and it is not certain if he will stay on. ""I don't think now is a good time to make a decision like that,"" he said afterwards.  ""I need to talk to the right people. It's not for now."" England are next in action on 7 September when they go to Dublin to take on the Republic of Ireland in their first 2024-25 Nations League game. Their homecoming will be three days later against Finland. Those games are in the second division of the Nations League after England were relegated last time. If Southgate was to leave at the end of his deal, he would see out the six Nations League games but be gone before qualifying started for the 2026 World Cup next year.",2024-07-14 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3g3r62p3kdo,Emlyn Begley,2024-07-14 21:09:53,
388,'I'm not at level of Alcaraz or Sinner' - Djokovic,"Djokovic has failed to win a title in 2024 Novak Djokovic says he is ""not at that level"" after falling to a chastening defeat against Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles Wimbledon final. The 24-time Grand Slam winner looked almost helpless as Alcaraz powered to a 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-4) win - his second straight victory over Djokovic in the SW19 showpiece. It is another result that marks a changing of the guard in men's tennis. Between them, 21-year-old Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, 22, have won all three of this year's Grand Slam tournaments. ""Both of them are the best this year by far, I feel like I'm not at that level,"" said 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic. ""In order to really have a chance to, I guess, beat these guys in Grand Slam latter stages or Olympics, I'm going to have to play much better than I did today and feel much better than I did today."" Yet to win a title this year, it has been Djokovic's worst start to a season since 2006. The 37-year-old was outplayed by Alcaraz in Sunday's final, with the young Spaniard reeling off deft drop shots, hefty serves and thunderous forehand winners. ""Just overall the way I felt on the court today against him, I was inferior on the court,"" Djokovic said in his news conference. ""That's it. He was a better player. He played every single shot better than I did."" When Djokovic fell a break down in the fourth set of last year's final, he took out his frustrations by smashing his racquet against the net post. However, there was barely a flicker of emotion from the seven-time Wimbledon champion when he found himself two sets to love down on Sunday. Nick Kyrgios, a runner-up to Djokovic in 2022, described him as being ""so flat"". ""I would have liked to have seen – whether it was a racquet smash or a roar or something – after Novak went down those two sets, I needed to see an outburst to kind of reset his energy,"" Kyrgios told BBC TV.  ""He was so flat for so long and then there was a game at 3-2 in the third set where he really came alive, but it was a bit too late."" This video can not be played Novak Djokovic's reaction to his defeat in Wimbledon final The Serb underwent surgery on a medial meniscus tear in his right knee less than a month before his first-round match. ""If someone told me I would play Wimbledon finals three, four weeks ago, I would take it for sure,"" Djokovic said. Alcaraz said it was ""amazing"" and ""unbelievable"" what Djokovic had done over the fortnight, describing his opponent as ""superman"". ""I did all I can to prepare myself for this match and this tournament in general,"" added Djokovic. ""Today I saw that I was just, as I said, half a step behind him in every sense. That's the reality that I have to accept at the moment."" Despite feeling that his performances of late are not matching those of Sinner or Alcaraz, Djokovic has no plans to retire any time soon. He is still planning on competing for Serbia at the Olympic Games in Paris this summer with the hope of winning a gold medal - the only thing missing from his vast trophy collection. ""Hopefully I can find the right tennis because I'm going to need all I have and more to go to the final of the Olympic Games,"" Djokovic said. He added: ""As far as coming back here, I mean, I would love to. I don't have anything else in my thoughts right now that this is my last Wimbledon. ""I don't have any limitations in my mind. I still want to keep going and play as long as I feel like I can play on this high level."" 'An all-round perfect performance' - so what next for Alcaraz?

389,Trump’s running mate JD Vance arrives to standing ovation at Republican convention,"Christal HayesUS reporter In an interview with NBC's Lester Holt , externalthat follows an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, President Biden rejects the idea that he uses language that ""could incite people who are not balanced"". ""I've not engaged in that rhetoric,"" Biden says firmly. ""Now, my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric."" Biden mentions various examples of Trump's rhetoric that he deems dangerous, including the jokes the former president made after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was nearly killed by a man who broke into her home. Biden says it is challenging because he believes that is necessary to highlight his view that his predecessor poses a ""threat to democracy"". ""How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?"" Biden says. ""Do you just not say anything, because it may incite somebody?""",2024-07-15 23:10:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cljy6yz1j6gt,Unknown,Unknown,
390,JD Vance once criticised Trump. Now he's his running mate,"“I’m a ‘never Trump’ guy. I never liked him.” “My god what an idiot.” “I find him reprehensible.” That was from JD Vance in interviews and on Twitter in 2016, when the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy catapulted him to fame. In the same year, he wrote privately to an associate on Facebook: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole ... or that he's America's Hitler"". A few short years later, Mr Vance transformed himself into one of Trump’s steadfast allies. And a few years after that the first-term senator from Ohio is now by Trump’s side as vice presidential running mate – and, by extension, an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 - with a reliably conservative voting record and midwestern roots that are sure to help boost the ticket at the ballot box. In fact, Mr Vance has made something of a habit of transformation. How did he emerge from a tough upbringing to reach the highest levels of American politics? Mr Vance was born James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Although Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, Mr Vance identified closely with his family’s roots slightly to the south in Appalachia, the vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest. It includes some of the country’s poorest areas. Mr Vance painted an honest portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of his family members and friends. And his book also took a decidedly conservative view – describing them as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on welfare payments and mostly failing to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”. “The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.” While he poured scorn on ""elites"" and exclusive society, he painted himself as a counterpoint to the chronic failure of those he grew up with. By the time the book came out, Mr Vance’s own bootstrap tugging had slung him far away from Middletown: first to the US Marines and a tour of duty in Iraq, and later to Ohio State University, Yale Law School and a job as a venture capitalist in California. Hillbilly Elegy made him not only into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white working-class voters, and he rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee. “I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016.  ""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.”    In 2017 Mr Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whom he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. As the child of Indian immigrants who grew up in San Diego, Usha Vance has a very different background from her husband. She also attended Yale as an undergraduate and received a masters degree from University of Cambridge. She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after law school and is currently a litigator. Mr Vance's name was long whispered about as a political candidate, and he saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, he got a kick-start via a $10m  (£7.7m) donation by his former boss, Silicon Valley power broker Peter Thiel. But the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected in increasingly Republican Ohio was his past criticism of Trump. He apologised for his previous remarks and managed to mend fences and earn Trump’s endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate.  In the process, Mr Vance has become an increasingly important player in the world of Make America Great Again politics – and has signed up almost completely to Trump’s agenda. In the Senate he has been a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine. Given his short tenure in the Democrat-led chamber, the bills he has sponsored have rarely moved forward and they tend to send more messages than change policies. In recent months, Mr Vance introduced bills to withhold federal funds for colleges where there are encampments or Gaza-Israel war protests and for colleges that employ undocumented immigrants, for example. Showing both his foreign policy hawkishness and his background in finance, Mr Vance sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government off from US capital markets if it does not follow international trade law. Mr Vance, who was baptized as a Catholic in 2019, is anti-abortion, but has recently backed Trump’s view that the matter should be left up to individual states to decide. When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented Mr Vance's views.",2024-07-15 23:10:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-15 21:10:37,
403,'It will be great to see him': Joy and relief for Trump faithful at convention,"Just two days after a bloodied Donald Trump mouthed ""fight!’ to his supporters after a brazen assassination attempt, Republicans at the opening day of the party’s convention in Milwaukee chanted the same word as they prepared to welcome him back to the stage. The former president will deliver a much-anticipated speech in the Wisconsin city on Thursday, but there has been hope he will make an earlier public appearance at the convention, which formally nominated him as presidential candidate on Monday. Trump said he “threw away” the prepared text of his speech entirely after the shooting at his rally on Saturday, a sign of how the attempt on his life has changed the dynamics of this gathering, one of the biggest moments of any presidential campaign. Republicans at the convention told the BBC the shooting, which left one dead and two others seriously injured, had supercharged already united behind Trump within the party.  As music blasted on the convention floor on Monday evening, the mood was defiant but excited - with many saying they felt he would win November’s election.  But the recent attack - a shocking act of political violence - was still fresh in minds and had left some shaken. “Saturday scared me,” Joe Mullins, a delegate from Florida, said. “We’d be in a whole different world if not for half an inch.  “I had tears in my eyes. I haven’t cried like that since I lost my mother.” For others, the thought of Trump returning to the stage for what will likely be an enormous, raucous standing ovation was not just exciting, but reassuring given how close the 78-year-old came to being more seriously hurt. “It will be great to see him up and walking around after Saturday,” Matt Limoges, the chair of the Philadelphia Young Republicans, said. “This is a historic moment. Everybody is very, very happy. I think everybody here is behind him and everybody is looking forward to sending him back to the White House.” Terasa Filsoof, who is attending the convention with the Republican Jewish Coalition, was watching the Pennsylvania rally on TV when 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crookes fired at the former president and rallygoers.  “When [Trump] grabbed his ear and fell, I just immediately thought the worst,” she told the BBC. “But when he stood up with the fist, we knew all was going to be well.” A delegate from Wisconsin, Cindy Werner, was also watching in panic as the dramatic scenes unfolded. “I turned on the TV and instantly started praying,” she said. “I'm really thankful that God… it was God that gave him the grace. I’m so relieved.” Ms Filsoof said the images that quickly spread on social media after the shooting, which showed a bloody Trump raising his fist in front of a billowing American flag, showed “exactly what he thinks of this country - stand tall, stand proud, and fight for what you believe in"". “There's no room for that on either side,” she said of the attack. “There's absolutely no room for violence. There's no room - the rhetoric, it's just been too far on both sides. I think it's just too much.” While some attendees expressed anger at the shooting, and others called for displays of solidarity and well-wishes for Trump, the overarching mood in Milwaukee is still one of celebration. “It's electric. Everyone’s cheering and supporting their fellow states. ""It's been wonderful,” said Ms Filsoof, who had made her own disco-ball cowboy hat, and adorned it with red ribbons and an American flag. Ms Werner, meanwhile, said the moment her state pledged its delegates to the former president was a moving moment. “I felt proud,” she said. “I felt that we will have a fighter that will get back into the fight.” Additional reporting by Alex Lederman ",2024-07-15 23:10:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3grjxv312zo,"Gareth Evans & Kayla Epstein,",2024-07-15 23:02:38,

401,Who are the Trump rally shooting victims?,"An attempt to assassinate former US president Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania has left one bystander dead and two seriously injured.  Trump suffered an upper ear injury but was otherwise unharmed, later telling reporters that if he had moved his head slightly, he would have been hit in the head. Three other men who were attending the rally on 13 July were not so lucky.  Here is what we know about them.  The 50-year-old volunteer fire chief died while trying to protect his family during the attempted assassination - diving onto them to shield them from the bullets.  “Corey died a hero,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at a news conference following the shooting, adding that Comperatore went to church every Sunday and ""loved his community"". ""Most especially, Corey loved his family,"" said Mr Shapiro. Mr Comperatore's daughter Allyson later wrote on social media about how her father had thrown her and her mother to the ground and ""shielded my body from the bullet that came at us"".  ""He truly loved us enough to take a real bullet for us. And I want nothing more than to cry on him and tell him thank you."" Allyson described her father as the ""best dad a girl could ever ask for"" and said he ""could talk and make friends with anyone"". “This feels like a terrible nightmare but we know it is our painful reality,"" Mr Comperatore's sister Dawn wrote on Facebook.  He was said to be an avid Trump supporter and to have been excited to attend the Pennsylvania rally where he was later killed.  According to Pennsylvania police, Mr Comperatore lived in Sarver, about 12 miles (19km) away from the rally site in Butler, outside the city of Pittsburgh.  ""He was a man that just wanted to protect and serve and love. He was truly a man of love,"" fellow firefighter Craig Cirrincione told the Associated Press. In addition to his volunteer firefighting work, he was employed as a project and tooling engineer at a plastics manufacturing company, according to his social media profiles. “He was a good person,” neighbour Matt Achilles told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “We might not have agreed on the same political views, but that didn’t stop him from being a good friend and neighbour.” “He donated money to us when I was in the hospital and he would always come by at our yard sales. He always waved hello when I drove past his house,” Mr Achilles said. Mr Dutch is from the Pennsylvania city of New Kensington and is a long-time employee of the technology company Siemens, according to his sister.  Jennifer Veri-Grazier told the New York Times that the 57-year-old suffered damage to his liver and broken ribs in the shooting and has had to have more than one operation.  She described him as a long-time Trump supporter. “He was exercising his rights and went to the rally, and he didn’t deserve any of this,” Ms Veri-Grazier said. The Pennsylvania branch of the Marine Corps League, a veterans' association, has identified Mr Dutch as one of its members on social media.  Mr Copenhaver, 74, is from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, and was a registered Democrat, the New York Times reports. Albert Quaye, a supervisor in Moon Township, told the newspaper that Mr Copenhaver was retired and had become very interested in local politics. Mr Copenhaver is listed as a member of Moon Township's Military Banner Committee, which organises tributes for the area's veterans.

400,Five questions for Secret Service after Trump shooting,"Several major questions have emerged for the US Secret Service to answer in the aftermath of the shooting of Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. The FBI has taken on the role of lead investigator into the incident, during which one person was killed and two others critically injured - while Trump was wounded in the ear. As the US demands answers, the Secret Service says it is working to discover ""what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again"".  Its chief, Kimberly Cheatle, has been summoned to testify before a committee of the US House of Representatives on 22 July. Here are some of the questions that experts have started asking. It remains unclear how suspected gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks got access to the roof of a building near the rally that was little more than 130m (430 ft) from Trump. The rooftop was a known vulnerability before the event, according to NBC News, which cited two sources familiar with Secret Service operations. “Someone should have been on the roof or securing the building so no one could get on the roof,” NBC quoted one of the sources as saying. As well as the access question, it has been suggested that the line of sight from the rooftop to Trump's podium area should have been blocked off.  Crooks should not have been able to get a direct sight of Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC News on Monday.  Mr Mayorkas said officials would ""really study the event independently, and make recommendations to the Secret Service and to me"". An eyewitness to the shooting told the BBC that he and others had ""clearly"" spotted Crooks crawling around on the roof with a rifle. They alerted police but the suspect continuing moving around for several minutes before firing shots and then being shot dead himself, the eyewitness said. FBI special agent Kevin Rojek admitted it had been ""surprising"" that the attacker had been able to open fire. The county sheriff has confirmed that Crooks was spotted by a local police officer, who was unable to stop him in time. Something that remains unclear is whether this information reached the agents around Trump. Crooks was already on officials' radar, according to a senior law enforcement official. They anonymously told CNN that officers thought he was acting suspiciously near the event magnetometers. This information was allegedly relayed to the Secret Service.  The gunman fired his shots from what police have described as a ""secondary ring"", which was patrolled not by the Secret Service but by local and state officers.  A former Secret Service agent said this sort of arrangement only worked when there was a clear plan on what to do when a danger was spotted.  “When you rely on the local law enforcement partners, you better have carefully planned and told them what you expect them to do about a threat,” Jonathan Wackrow told the Washington Post. The county sheriff has admitted there had been ""a failure"" but said there was no single party to blame. A former chair of the House Oversight Committee has suggested that the Secret Service was ""spread too thin"", which compounded the issue that local police would not have been ""trained up"" to secure an event like Saturday's rally. Jason Chaffetz, who has previously reported on Secret Service failures, told the Washington Post there was no bigger ""threat profile"" than for Trump or President Biden, but that this was not reflected in the security presence in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has denied suggestions that a request from the Trump team to beef up the staffing had been rebuffed in advance of the rally. But the Post reported that it had seen an exchange of messages in which a former Secret Service officer asked colleagues how the suspect had got a gun so close to Trump. He was reported to have received the reply: ""Resources."" In a statement on Monday, Ms Cheatle said changes had been made to Trump's Secret Service detail ahead of the start of the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on Monday. She said she was ""confident"" in the overall plan. The agents who shielded Trump have received praise, including from former agent Robert McDonald, who said they did a ""fairly good job"" despite there being no exact ""playbook"" on what to do in such a situation.  But the question has also been asked whether they were fast enough to whisk the former president away into a vehicle. Footage of the incident shows them rapidly forming a shield around him in the immediate wake of the gunshots, but then appearing to pause as Trump asks to gather his shoes. The former president goes on to pump his fist for supporters. A Secret Service veteran told the New York Times he would not have waited. ""If that's me there, no. We are going, and we are going now,"" said Jeffrey James.  ""If it's me, I'm buying him a new pair of shoes.""

399,Tragedy at Trump rally upends election campaign - for now,"The 2024 election campaign has a new iconic image: Donald Trump, moments after narrowly avoiding serious injury or death from an assassin’s bullets, standing with his fist raised, lines of blood streaked across his face, an American flag billowing in the breeze behind him. “Fight! Fight! Fight!” the former president said, as some of the supporters, who moments before had feared for their lives, began cheering. The bloodshed in Pennsylvania will leave a lasting mark on the American psyche, puncturing the veneer of security around the highest levels of presidential politics – of magnetic screening, bulletproof limousines and heavily armed Secret Service agents. Even former presidents are not insulated from the violence that can erupt in everyday American life. It was also a dramatic moment in American political history; one that is sure to be replayed in video clips, still photographs and testimonial accounts throughout the course of this presidential campaign and in campaigns to come. In a rare address from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Joe Biden called on Americans to cool the temperature around political debate. ""[It] must never be a battlefield and, God forbid, a killing field,"" he warned. ""No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence."" The attack has already begun coursing through America's partisan dialogue, as numerous Republicans have spoken out to condemn President Biden and the Democrats for creating a rhetorical environment conducive to the violence. They point to dire warnings about the former president becoming a dictator and threatening democracy as examples of the overheated language that could inspire an assassin. In particular, they highlight leaked comments the president made in private to donors just last week about increasing the attacks on the former president’s record and putting a “bull’s-eye” on him. “They've tried to take him out in so many other ways, financially, they've tried to throw him in jail,” Donald Trump Jr said in a television interview on Sunday. “It's almost as if they would love for this to happen.”  At least so far, however, the motives and political affiliations of the alleged assassin, 20-year-old Pennsylvania resident Thomas Matthew Crooks, are in doubt. They may ultimately defy an easy partisan narrative. The former president’s oldest son went on to add that, after the assassination attempt, those on the left can no longer accuse the former president of culpability for the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.  That violent episode took place hours after the then-president had held a rally just a few dozen blocks away, challenging the 2020 election results. His actions on that day led to his impeachment by the House of Representatives and, more than a year later, indictment by a special counsel appointed by the US attorney general. If the Pennsylvania shooting defuses this line of criticism by Democrats, it’s just one way in which it will have fundamentally reshaped this presidential campaign. Others may become clear over the course of the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday in Milwaukee. The failed attack on the former president plays into several themes the Trump campaign was already planning for the quadrennial gathering, which culminates with Trump taking the stage to accept his party’s nomination on Thursday night. The first is that it could provide a boost to the politics of grievance and persecution that have been a central focus of his rally speeches and social media posts. “They’re not really after me; they’re after you,” is a common Trump refrain, on t-shirts, billboards and car stickers. “I’m just in the way.” That message will land with new force after the former president and his crowd of supporters were sprayed with bullets. Trump’s legions of fans – many of whose support borders on near-messianic hero-worship - will have all the more reason to identify with a man who almost lost his life while standing before them. The former president’s brush with death, and subsequent acts of bloody defiance, will also fit with the contrast Trump campaign officials have said they are trying to draw at this week’s convention – one where their candidate, and party, embody rugged masculinity and strength, while their opponents are feeble. President Biden’s age and capabilities have dogged his campaign for months – and prompted a Democratic crisis of confidence in his re-election effort after a stunningly poor performance at the presidential debate just over two weeks ago. Saturday night’s attack, and Trump’s response to it, will allow Republicans to put that contrast in stark relief in the days ahead. Democrats have spent the past two weeks in anguished soul-searching over their president’s political future. Now, they have a new set of concerns. In a way, the assassination attempt may end up providing a political lifeline to Mr Biden, given that the focus has dramatically shifted away from his age-related struggles and internal attempts to oust him. But the president’s re-election strategy – which hinges on painting Trump as a danger to the nation if he again becomes president – could be seriously hampered if the American public is hostile to new, pointed criticisms of the man. The Biden campaign has already pulled all negative advertising directed at the former president, lest it be viewed as inappropriate given the national mood. The president also rescheduled a trip to Texas planned for Monday. It is only a pause, however, and Democrats will need to go back on the offensive if they hope to erase the narrow lead the former president holds. That lead – small and not insurmountable, but still significant - has held stable for months, even as national politics have been buffeted by a seemingly endless stream of unprecedented news stories. The former president’s trial and conviction, a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions, Mr Biden’s debate flop - none of these has seemed to move the American political needle in what has been, and appears destined to remain, a sharply divided nation. While there has been considerable talk about how this presidential campaign has been upended by the assassination attempt, there is no guarantee that the race will not return to its near-dead-heat equilibrium point in the three months before election day. Only now the Democrats have less time, less of a money advantage and less political oxygen to shift the electoral dynamics in their favour. What Saturday night’s tragedy demonstrated most clearly, however, is that expectations and political narratives can shift in seconds.",2024-07-15 23:10:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd172rp02e0o,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-15 02:10:38,
398,Biden urges America to 'lower temperature' after Trump shooting,"US President Joe Biden has condemned the assassination attempt on his predecessor Donald Trump in a primetime address from the White House, telling Americans that US politics must never be a ""killing field"". Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, was wounded in the ear after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and two more were critically injured in the attack.  In the Oval Office address - just the third of his presidency - Mr Biden urged Americans to ""take a step back"" and warned that ""political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated"".  ""No matter how strong our convictions, we must never descend into violence,"" Mr Biden said in remarks that lasted just under seven minutes.  His short, but forceful, address largely went off without a hitch, amid ongoing scrutiny following a number of high-profile verbal slips.  In his primetime address, the president called on Americans to come together and warned that increasing political polarisation meant November's election would be ""a time of testing"".  Mr Biden and Trump remain locked neck-and-neck in opinion polls ahead of the election.  Speaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Mr Biden listed off a growing number of violent political acts that have taken place in recent years.  ""We cannot, must not, go down this road again. We've travelled it before in our history,"" he said, citing shootings targeting congressional members in both parties, the assault on ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband and the 6 January riots. “In America we resolve our differences at the ballot box,"" he said. ""At the ballot box. Not with bullets."" Saturday's attack left America reeling, as Trump was struck in the ear shortly after he began speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.  In images beamed around the world, the 78-year-old could be seen with blood dripping from his ear and down his face, raising a defiant fist as Secret Service agents pulled him off stage and into a waiting car. The gunman - identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks - was shot dead at the scene by Secret Service agents. Law enforcement agents told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that they discovered explosive materials in his vehicle nearby and at his home.  Officials say they are still investigating what motivated the attack. Crooks was a registered Republican who had previously donated $15 to a liberal campaign group in 2021, according to media reports. Classmates described him as a quiet young man who was bullied throughout school. A local gun club near his home in Pennsylvania confirmed he had been a member. In his speech, Mr Biden said he was praying for the family of Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old former firefighter who was shot and killed - along with two others who were critically injured - during the rally. The father-of-two was killed while shielding his family from bullets as they whizzed past Trump and struck members of the audience.  Mr Biden called Mr Comperatore a ""hero"" who was killed ""while simply exercising his freedom to support a candidate of his choosing"". Allies of Trump's have been quick to blame President Biden and his campaign for the attack, alleging that the top Democrat had sought to stoke fears about his rival's return to office.  ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,"" JD Vance - a Republican senator who is under consideration for the vice-presidential nomination - wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  President Biden avoided addressing those criticisms in his address on Sunday night, though his campaign has temporarily pulled attack ads against Trump.  The former president himself has sought to strike a conciliatory tone since the shooting, thanking his Secret Service detail for their quick actions and calling on citizens to ""stand united"" and to ""show our True Character as Americans"". He arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday night for the Republican National Convention, where he will accept his party's nomination for president.  Trump is also expected to announce his running-mate. US media has reported that just three men are still under consideration for the vice-presidential slot: Florida Senator Marco Rubio, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and Senator Vance of Ohio. In a news conference earlier on Sunday, the Secret Service said they had no plans to impose additional security measures around the convention, saying they were satisfied with existing arrangements.  The agency has come under scrutiny as to how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump, despite members of the audience reportedly pointing him out to police.

395,'Serial killer' arrested after bodies found in Kenya dump,"Kenyan police have arrested a man who they have described as a “serial killer” suspected to have been behind the gruesome murder of nine women whose mutilated bodies were found in a disused quarry used as a rubbish dump. Police say Collins Jomaisi Khalusha, 33, confessed to having killed 42 women since 2022, including his own wife. The suspect was arrested at a bar early on Monday morning as he was watching the Euro final. There has been shock and outrage in Kenya since the first of the dismembered bodies were found on Friday at the Mukuru quarry in the capital, Nairobi. “[He] confessed to have lured, killed and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, all murdered between 2022 and as recent as Thursday,"" said Mohamed Amin, head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). Many Kenyans are asking how 42 people could be murdered in the space of two years without police noticing.  Mr Amin said that after his arrest, the suspect led police officers to his house, about 100m (yards) from the crime scene. The police displayed to the media some of the items said to have been recovered from the suspect’s house, including 10 phones, a laptop, identity cards and personal female clothing. They also found a machete they ""believed was being used to dismember the victims"",  and nine sacks like the ones used to dispose of the bodies. Since Friday, police have cordoned off the dumpsite where the bodies were found in various stages of decomposition.   The victims were aged between 18 and 30 and were all killed in the same way, according to the police. While the authorities have confirmed that nine bodies have been found so far in the quarry, local residents say the number is higher. Joseph Waweru, who has been involved in retrieving the bodies, told the BBC he had counted 16 bodies, all severely dismembered. Police said they were still interrogating the suspect to establish the motive for the killings and he would be arraigned in court on Tuesday. They said his arrest followed a ""forensic analysis"" of a mobile phone that belonged to one of the victims, Josephine Mulongo Owino, ""where some mobile money transactions were conducted on the very day [she] went missing"". Post-mortem examinations on the bodies were being conducted, the police said. They have asked families ""who believe that their beloved ones may have fallen prey to these macabre murders"" to report to the police. ""It is crystallising that we are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for human life, who has no respect and dignity,"" Mr Amin said. Emmanuel Ogongo, whose sister went missing on 28 June, said he had identified a body from the dump site that looked like her. He said the body had the same hairstyle and outfit she was wearing when she disappeared. Only the torso has been found so far. A second person with a phone belonging to one of the victims has also been arrested and would be treated either as an accomplice or suspect, he said. Kenya's police watchdog earlier said it was investigating whether there was any police involvement in the crimes as the dumpsite is close to a police station.  The officers working there have been transferred, to ensure ""fair and unbiased investigations"" into the ""heinous"" deaths, the acting police chief, Douglas Kanja said earlier. The Independent Police Oversight Authority said “widespread allegations of police involvement in unlawful arrests [and] abductions” meant it was undertaking a preliminary investigation to establish whether there was any police connection. Hussein Khalid, head of the Haki Africa campaign group, told the BBC that police need to address how the murders happened just metres from a police station.  The discovery of these bodies comes at a difficult time for Kenya's police. Human rights groups have accused the police of shooting dozens of people who were demonstrating against planned tax rises earlier this month, some of them fatally. Many Kenyans are calling for the police to investigate the allegations of abductions and killings from the protests as quickly as they have investigated the Mukuru deaths.  On Friday, Kenya's police chief Japhet Koome resigned, a day after President William Ruto fired his entire cabinet in the wake of the deadly protests. The killings are being seen as the latest police failure to adequately deal with crime especially as it happened so close to a police station. Some Kenyans are questioning why the police have been unable to solve the death of Rita Waeni, whose dismembered body was found earlier this year at a short-term rental apartment in Nairobi. Like the latest gruesome deaths, Waeni’s brutal murder shocked and angered many Kenyans. It ignited an online campaign urging the protection of women and girls. Last year Kenyans were horrified after the remains of hundreds of people associated with a doomsday cult were discovered in the Indian Ocean coastal town of Malindi. Paul Nthenge Mackenzie went on trial in Mombasa earlier last week on charges of terrorism and murder over the deaths of more than 440 of his followers.

396,Cave discovered on Moon could be home for humans,"Scientists have for the first time discovered a cave on the Moon. At least 100m deep, it could be an ideal place for humans to build a permanent base, they say. It is just one in probably hundreds of caves hidden in an “underground, undiscovered world”, according to the researchers. Countries are racing to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, but they will need to protect astronauts from radiation, extreme temperatures, and space weather. Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut to travel to space, told BBC News that the newly-discovered cave looked like a good place for a base, and suggested humans could potentially be living in lunar pits in 20-30 years. But, she said, this cave is so deep that astronauts might need to abseil in and use “jet packs or a lift” to get out. Lorenzo Bruzzone and Leonardo Carrer at the University of Trento in Italy found the cave by using radar to penetrate the opening of a pit on a rocky plain called the Mare Tranquillitatis. It is visible to the naked eye from Earth, and is also where Apollo 11 landed in 1969. The cave has a skylight on the Moon’s surface, leading down to vertical and overhanging walls, and a sloping floor that might extend further underground. It was made millions or billions of years ago when lava flowed on the Moon, creating a tunnel through the rock. The closest equivalent on Earth would be the volcanic caves in Lanzarote, Spain, Prof Carrer explains, adding that the researchers visited those caves as part of their work. “It’s really exciting. When you make these discoveries and you look at these images, you realise you’re the first person in the history of humanity to see it,” Prof Carrer said. Once Prof Bruzzone and Prof Carrer understood how big the cave was, they realised it could be a good spot for a lunar base.  “After all, life on Earth began in caves, so it makes sense that humans could live inside them on the Moon,” says Prof Carrer. The cave has yet to be fully explored, but the researchers hope that ground-penetrating radar, cameras or even robots could be used to map it. Scientists first realised there were probably caves on the Moon around 50 years ago. Then in 2010 a camera on a mission called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter took pictures of pits that scientists thought could be cave entrances. But researchers did not know how deep the caves might be, or if they would have collapsed. Prof Bruzzone and Prof Carrer’s work has now answered that question, although there is much more to be done to understand the full scale of the cave. “We have very good images of the surface - up to 25cm of resolution - we can see the Apollo landing sites - but we know nothing about what lies below the surface. There are huge opportunities for discovery,” Francesco Sauro, Coordinator of the Topical Team Planetary Caves of the European Space Agency, told BBC News. The research may also help us explore caves on Mars in the future, he says.  That could open the door to finding evidence of life on Mars, because if it did exist, it would almost certainly have been inside caves protected from the elements on the planet’s surface. The Moon cave might be useful to humans, but the scientists also stress that it could help answer fundamental questions about the history of the Moon, and even our solar system. The rocks inside the cave will not be as damaged or eroded by space weather, so they can provide an extensive geological record going back billions of years.

394,"Jay Slater search teams find body, police in Tenerife say","Search teams looking for Jay Slater in Tenerife have found a body near the last known location of the missing British teenager's mobile phone. The Guardia Civil said its officers and a mountain rescue unit found the body of a young man in the Masca area ""after 29 days of non-stop searching"".  The 19-year-old was last seen on 17 June, after visiting an Airbnb rented by two people he had been with at a music festival on the island.  A police statement said that ""initial evidence"" suggested the person found had ""suffered an accident or fall in the inaccessible zone"". It added that ""the discovery was possible thanks to the incessant and discreet search carried out by the Guardia Civil... in which the natural space was preserved so that it would not be filled with onlookers."" Police said that ""all the evidence"" suggested the remains found were those of ""the young British man who disappeared"". Full identification of the body is yet to be carried out, it added.  The charity LBT Global, which works with families of people missing overseas, said that the remains were found along with Mr Slater's clothes and possessions, close to his mobile phone's last known location. The group said it was supporting Mr Slater's family ""at this distressing time and ask for everyone to afford them space and privacy to come to terms with the news"". Mr Slater's father Warren Slater described his disappearance as ""a living hell"", while his mother Debbie Duncan told of her ""pain and agony"" as no trace could be found.  The search for Mr Slater since his disappearance has involved his family, friends, police and specialist mountain rescue teams as well as volunteers from several countries.  Most recently the family, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, was helped by a group of Dutch mountain rescuers.  In Mr Slater's hometown of Oswaldtwistle, news that the search had resulted in the discovery of a body was met with shock.  Paul Fitzpatrick, the landlord of the Hare And Hounds pub, told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""If it's true that it's him then we are all devastated for his family, his mum especially. ""She has been a good friend to us all, we've known Debbie for years. I've been here for 17 years... her boy then would have been a baby. ""It's horrible news if it is confirmed that it is him."" The Guardia Civil indicated in its statement that it was members of its Mountain Rescue and Intervention Group who located the ""lifeless body"" of a young man.  Throughout the month since Mr Slater went missing, his family have refused to give up hope.  On Saturday, a statement of an official fundraising page, which has raised more than £50,000 towards search efforts, described him as a ""normal, hardworking young lad from Lancashire who is very loved by all who know him"".  ""Although we don't have any answers to his disappearance we obviously have to remain positive,"" his friend Lucy Mae Law posted on behalf of his family. Lancashire Police, which had previously had its offer to help with the search turned down by the Tenerife police, said in a statement that it ""had today been notified by the Guardia Civil that they have found the body of a man and that the indications are that this is Jay Slater"".  The statement added: ""While at this stage no formal identification has been carried out our thoughts are very much with Jay’s family at this time, and we continue to offer them our support."" Search teams have had to contend with difficult terrain throughout their search for Mr Slater. Tenerife is a volcanic island in the Atlantic ocean archipelago of the Canary Islands, and the area in which Mr Slater was last seen is full of steep cliffs and gorges. The land is arid and dotted with cacti.  In his last phone call to his friend Ms Law shortly before his phone battery died, Mr Slater is said to have told her that he was bleeding and needed water.  Another friend of Mr Slater, Brad Hargreaves, later said in a television interview that Mr Slater had video called him just before the call to Ms Law, and had indicated he had slipped off the road he was walking.  Within days of Mr Slater's disappearance, social media was awash with theories about what had happened to him, including suggestions of foul play. The Guardia Civil has never suggested they believed any harm had come to Mr Slater by any other person or people.  But that did not do anything to quell the rampant speculation. His family and friends said they had found themselves the victims of online trolls.  Rachel Hargreaves, the mother of Mr Slater's friend Bradley Hargreaves, told the BBC she had received a friend request from a fake account using her late mother's photo as its profile picture.  She said ""things don't normally get to me"", but that had affected her.  ""We’re living the worst nightmare you can live and this does not help,"" she said.  Mr Slater's mother also made reference to the upset caused by the online frenzy around the case.  ""There is a lot of negativity unfortunately and this is adding to the heartbreak of the unknown"", she said in an update on the GoFundMe page, set up to help pay for the search.

393,How to watch the Republican National Convention,"Former US President Donald Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running-mate Monday afternoon, one day after arriving in Wisconsin for the Republican National Convention and two days after surviving an assassination attempt. The party conference in Milwaukee is going ahead as planned despite Saturday evening’s shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania where Trump was shot in the ear. Trump posted on social media that he considered delaying his trip by two days, “but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else”. The attack on the candidate has put a heightened focus on the event's safety and security.  But Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, RNC coordinator for the US Secret Service, said Sunday that there would be no changes to the security plan.  The convention, which began on Monday, is being held at the home of the Milwaukee Bucks, an NBA basketball team. Some 50,000 people are expected to attend the four-day jamboree of pageantry, politics and policy as the party makes its case to voters ahead of November’s general election. Once every four years each of the two main US parties hosts a convention to formally select their respective White House standard-bearer and prepare for the final stretch of campaigning. The conferences include high-profile speakers, as well as a prime-time speech from the presidential candidate. During the convention, the delegates from each state pledge their support to the candidate of their choice and approve a platform.  It is merely a formality for Trump as the party's presumptive nominee because he won 2,265 delegates in the primaries, which is enough for the nomination. The Democrats will hold their convention next month in Chicago.  Trump is not expected to speak until Thursday night. One of the biggest moments of the conference came Monday when he announced Mr Vance as his running mate.  Donald Trump Jr, the former president's son, is expected to speak on Wednesday. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, one of Trump’s fiercest rivals during the Republican primary, was originally expected to skip the RNC. But after the assassination attempt, it was reported that she will now not only attend but speak at the conference. Other speakers reportedly include Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia congresswoman, Arizona Senate contender Kari Lake, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Dana White, head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Teamsters union general president Sean O'Brien. RNC co-chair Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of the former president, said celebrities will also be among the speakers. Amber Rose, model, reality star and former girlfriend of Kanye West, is expected to address the crowd. But former stalwarts of the Republican Party establishment, such George W Bush, Mike Pence and Mitt Romney, are not on the guest list. Monday's theme will be ""Make America Wealthy Once Again"", Tuesday will be ""Make America Safe Again"", Wednesday is ""Make America Strong Again"" and Thursday is ""Make America Great Once Again"". The party platform this year is 16 pages. Some themes of Project 2025, a much longer think-tank proposal, are also likely to come up during the convention. Project 2025 - from which Trump has distanced himself - calls for expanding presidential powers, eliminating thousands of civil servant posts, tax cuts and dismantling the Department of Education.  Former first lady Melania Trump, who rarely makes public appearances, will attend the convention, according to US media. Mrs Trump did not attend the 27 June debate between President Joe Biden and Trump. Neither did she attend her husband’s hush-money trial earlier this year. While the former first lady has held Republican fundraisers in the past year, this would be her first major appearance of this election cycle. The Coalition to March hosted a demonstration Monday afternoon near the site of the convention.  Organisers said they expected 5,000 protestors but the crowd turned out smaller.   Karen Allington, a retired 64-year-old who attended Monday's protest, told the BBC she's worried about Trump’s agenda, which she says is fuelling political division. ""We want to be out here doing something positive,"" she said. ""I’m not sure the delegates will listen, but we want our voices heard."" Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said the city would ensure public safety is paramount this week. “A national special security event is the highest designation that you can get for a security event of its size and magnitude in the United States,” Mayor Johnson said.

392,Instagram influencer jailed for trafficking and slavery,"When two young Brazilian women were reported missing in September 2022, their families and the FBI launched a desperate search across the US to find them. All they knew was that they were living with wellness influencer Kat Torres. Torres has now been sentenced to eight years in prison for the human trafficking and slavery of one of those women. The BBC World Service has also been told that charges have been filed against her in relation to a second woman.  How did the former model who partied with Leonardo DiCaprio and graced the cover of international magazines come to groom her followers and lure them into sexual exploitation? “She kind of resembled hope for me,” says Ana, describing her reaction on stumbling across Torres’ Instagram page in 2017. Ana was not one of the missing women targeted in the FBI search - but she too was a victim of Torres’ coercion and would be key to their rescue. She says she was attracted to Torres’ trajectory from impoverished Brazilian favela to international catwalks, partying with Hollywood A-listers along the way. “She seemed like she had overcome violence in her childhood, abuse, all these traumatic experiences,” Ana told BBC Eye Investigations and BBC News Brasil. Ana was in a vulnerable situation herself. She says she had suffered a violent childhood, moved alone to the US from southern Brazil, and was previously in an abusive relationship. Torres had recently published her autobiography called A Voz [The Voice], in which she claimed she could make predictions as a result of her spiritual powers, and had been interviewed on reputable Brazilian media shows. “She was on the cover of magazines. She was seen with famous people such as Leonardo DiCaprio. Everything I saw seemed credible,” she says. Ana says she was particularly taken with Torres’ approach to spirituality. What Ana didn’t know was that the inspirational story Torres told was based on half-truths and lies. Torres’ ex-flatmate in New York, Luzer Twersky, told us that her Hollywood friends had introduced her to the hallucinogenic drug ayahuasca, and she was never the same again. ”That’s when she kind of… started going off the deep end,” he says. He said he also believed that she was working as a sugar baby - paid for romantic involvement with wealthy and powerful men who were also paying for the flat they shared together. Torres’ wellness website and subscription service promised customers: “Love, money and self-esteem that you always dreamed of.” Self-help videos offered advice on relationships, wellness, business success and spirituality - including hypnosis, meditation and exercise programmes. For an extra $150 (£120) clients could unlock exclusive one-to-one video consultations with Torres during which she would claim to solve any of their problems. Amanda, another former client who lives in the Brazilian capital, says Kat made her feel special. “All my doubts, my questions, my decisions: I always took them to her first, so that we could make decisions together,” she says. But it appears that advice had a dark side. Ana, Amanda, and other former followers say they found themselves becoming increasingly psychologically isolated from friends and family and willing to do anything Torres suggested. When Torres asked Ana in 2019 to move to New York to work as her live-in assistant, she agreed. She had been studying nutrition at university in Boston, but arranged to study online instead, and says she accepted the offer to look after Torres’ animals - and do her cooking, laundry and cleaning - for about $2000 (£1,564) a month. Like, Follow, Trafficked: Insta's Fake Guru  BBC Eye Investigations and BBC News Brasil uncover the truth behind the rise of wellness influencer and spiritual life coach, Kat Torres, and the international search for her trafficked followers  Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK) When she arrived at Torres’ apartment, though, she quickly realised it did not match the curated perfection projected on the influencer’s Instagram. “It was shocking because the house was really messy, really dirty, didn’t smell good,” she says. Ana says Torres seemed unable to do even basic things without her, like taking a shower, because she couldn’t bear to be alone. She describes having to constantly be available for Torres, only being allowed to sleep for a few hours at a time, on a sofa covered in cat urine. She says some days she would hide in the apartment building’s gym, grabbing a few hours’ sleep rather than working out. “Now, I see that she was using me as a slave… she had satisfaction in it,” Ana says. Ana says she was never paid. “I felt like, ‘I’m stuck here, I don’t have a way out,’” she says. “I was probably one of her first victims of human trafficking.” She had given up her university accommodation back in Boston, so she had nowhere to return to, and no income to pay for alternative housing. Ana says when she tried to confront Torres, she became aggressive, triggering Ana’s painful history with domestic violence. Eventually, after three months, Ana found a way to escape by moving in with a new boyfriend. But that wasn’t the end of Ana’s role in Torres’ life. When the families of two other young Brazilian women reported them missing in September 2022, Ana knew she had to act. By this point, Torres’ life had grown in scale. She was now married to a man called Zach, a 21-year-old she had met in California, and they were renting a five-bedroom house in the suburbs of Austin, Texas. Repeating the pattern she had begun with Ana, Torres had targeted her most dedicated followers, trying to recruit them to come and work for her. In return, she had promised to help them achieve their dreams, capitalising on the intimate personal details they had shared with her during life-coaching sessions. Desirrê Freitas, a Brazilian woman living in Germany, and Brazilian Letícia Maia - the two women whose disappearance would go on to spark the FBI-led search - moved to live with Torres. Another Brazilian woman, who we are calling Sol, was also recruited. Posting on her social media channels, Torres introduced her “witch clan” to her followers. The BBC has discovered at least four more women were almost persuaded to join Torres in the house but had pulled out. Some of the women were too scared to appear in the BBC’s film - afraid of receiving online abuse and still traumatised by their experiences - but we have been able to verify their accounts using court documents, text messages, bank statements, and Desirrê’s memoir about her experiences - @Searching Desirrê, published by DISRUPTalks. Desirrê says that in her case, Torres had bought her a plane ticket from Germany, having told her she was suicidal and needed Desirrê’s support. Torres is also accused of persuading Letícia, who was 14 when she started life-coaching sessions with her, to move to the US for an au pair programme and then drop out to live and work with her. As for Sol, she says she agreed to move in with Torres after becoming homeless and was hired to carry out tarot readings and yoga classes. But it was not long before the women discovered their reality was very different to the fairytale they had been promised. Within weeks, Desirrê says Torres pressured her into working at a local strip club, saying if she did not comply Desirrê would have to repay all the money she had spent on her: flights, accommodation, furniture for her room, and even the “witchcraft” Torres had performed. Desirrê says not only she did not have this money, she also believed at the time in the spiritual powers Torres claimed to have, so when Torres threatened to curse her for not following orders she was terrified. Reluctantly, Desirrê agreed to work as a stripper. A manager from the strip club, James, told the BBC she would work extremely long hours, seven days a week. Desirrê and Sol say the women in the Austin mansion were subjected to strict house rules. They describe being forbidden from speaking to each other, needing Torres’ permission to leave their rooms - even to use the bathroom - and being required to immediately hand over all earnings. “It was very difficult to, you know, get out of the situation because she holds your money,” Sol told the BBC. “It was terrifying. I thought something could happen to me because she had all my information, my passport, my driving licence.” But Sol says she realised she needed to somehow escape after overhearing a phone call in which Torres was telling another client she must work as a prostitute in Brazil as a “punishment”. Sol was able to leave with the help of an ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, the guns Torres’ husband kept began to regularly feature on her Instagram stories, and became a source of fear for the remaining women. Around this time, Desirrê says Torres tried to persuade her to swap the strip club for work as a prostitute. She says she refused and the following day Torres took her on a surprise day out to a gun range. Scared, Desirrê says she eventually gave in to Torres’ demand. “Many questions haunted me: ‘Could I stop whenever I wanted?’” Desirrê writes in her book. “And if the condom broke, would I get a disease? Could [the client] be an undercover cop and arrest me? What if he killed me?” If the women didn’t meet the earning quotas that Torres set, which had risen from $1,000 (£782) to $3,000 (£2,345) a day, they were not allowed to return to the house that night, they say. “I ended up sleeping on the street several times because I couldn't reach that,” Desirrê adds. Bank statements, seen by the BBC, show Desirrê transferring more than $21,000 (£16,417) into Torres’ account in June and July 2022 alone. She says that she was forced to hand over a substantially higher figure in cash. Prostitution is illegal in Texas and Desirrê says Torres would threaten to report her to the police if she ever talked about wanting to stop. In September, friends and family of Desirrê and Letícia back in Brazil launched social media campaigns to find them, having become increasingly concerned following months without contact. By this time, they were barely recognisable. Their brunette hair had been dyed platinum blonde to eerily match Torres’. Desirrê says by this point all her phone contacts had been blocked and she obeyed the influencer's orders without question. As the Instagram page @searchingDesirrê gained momentum, the story dominated news outlets in Brazil. Desirrê’s friends even worried she might have been murdered, and Letícia’s family put out desperate pleas for their safe return home. Ana, having lived with Torres in 2019, said alarm bells rang as soon as she saw the news stories. She says she immediately guessed that “[Torres] was keeping other girls”. Along with other former clients, Ana began to contact as many law enforcement agencies as possible, including the FBI, in an attempt to get the influencer arrested. Five months earlier, both she and Sol had reported Torres to the US police - but say they weren’t taken seriously. In a video she recorded at the time for evidence, since shared with the BBC, a distressed Ana can be heard saying, “this person is very dangerous and she has already threatened to kill me”. Then the missing women’s profiles on escort and prostitution websites were discovered. Suspicions of sexual exploitation, shared on social media, appeared to be confirmed. Panicked by the media attention, Torres and the women travelled more than 2,000 miles (3,219 km) from Texas to Maine. In chilling Instagram videos, Desirrê and Letícia denied being held captive and demanded people stop searching for them. But a recording, obtained by BBC News, gives an insight into what was really happening at this time. By now the US authorities were aware of the concerns about the women’s safety. Homeland security had tipped off a police officer who managed to FaceTime Torres to check on the women. But just before this starts, Torres can be heard saying on the video: “He will start asking questions. Guys, they are full of tricks. He’s a detective, be very careful. For God’s sake, I’ll kick you out if you say anything. I’ll scream.” In November 2022, the police finally convinced Torres and the two other women to attend a welfare check in person at Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Maine. The detective who questioned Torres, Desirrê and Letícia - Detective David Davol - told the BBC he and his colleagues had been immediately concerned, noticing a number of red flags, including a distrust of law enforcement, isolation and their reluctance to speak without Torres’ permission. “Human traffickers aren't always like in the movies, where you have… a gang that kidnapped people. It's far more common that it's someone you trust.” By December 2022, the two women had been safely returned to Brazil. Det Davol says, in his experience, human trafficking is on the rise. His observation is backed up by the UN, which says it is one of the fastest growing crimes, generating an estimated $150bn (£117bn) in profits a year worldwide. He believes social media gives it a platform on which to thrive, making it much easier for traffickers to find and groom victims. In April this year, our team was granted a rare court order to interview Torres in a Brazilian prison - the first media interview with her since her arrest. At that point, she was still waiting for the verdict of a trial against her relating to her treatment of Desirrê. Smiling, Torres approached us with a calm and collected demeanour. She was adamant that she was completely innocent, denying that any women had ever lived with her or that she had ever coerced anyone to take part in sex work. “When I was seeing the people testifying, they were saying so many lies. So many lies that at one point, I couldn't stop laughing,” she told us. “People are saying I am a fake guru, but at the same time, they are also saying that… ‘She is a danger to society because she can change people’s mind with her words.’” When we confronted her with the evidence that we ourselves had seen, she became more hostile, accusing us of lying too. “You choose to believe whatever you choose to believe. I can tell you I'm Jesus. And you can see Jesus, or you can see the devil, that’s it. It's your choice. It's your mind.” As she got up to return to her cell, she issued a parting threat, claiming we would soon find out if she had powers or not. She pointed at me, and said: “I didn’t like her.” The BBC can reveal that earlier this month Torres was sentenced by a Brazilian judge to eight years in prison for subjecting Desirrê to human trafficking and slavery. He concluded that she had lured the young woman to the US for the purpose of sexual exploitation. More than 20 women have reported being scammed or exploited by Torres - many of whom the BBC has spoken to and are still undergoing psychiatric therapy to recover from what they say they experienced as a result of her treatment of them. Torres’ lawyer told the BBC she has appealed her conviction and maintains her innocence. An investigation into the allegations from other women is ongoing in Brazil. Ana believes yet further victims may come forward, once they read about Torres’ crimes. This is the first time Ana has spoken publicly. She says she wants people to recognise that Torres’ actions amount to a serious crime and not some “Instagram drama”. In the closing pages of her book Desirrê also reflects on her experiences. “I’m not fully recovered yet, I’ve had a challenging year. I was sexually exploited, enslaved and imprisoned. “I hope my story serves as a warning.” Top image montage: BBC You can get in touch by following this link",2024-07-15 23:10:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydvj6951dyo,"Hannah Price,",2024-07-14 23:10:38,
391,Trump classified documents case dismissed by Florida judge,"A Florida judge has dismissed the US justice department's classified documents case against Donald Trump in a huge victory for the former president just days after a gunman attempted to assassinate him.  Judge Aileen Cannon granted Mr Trump's motion to dismiss the federal case on the basis that the justice department's appointment of special prosecutor Jack Smith violates the Appointments Clause of the US Constitution.  He pleaded not guilty to several charges in the case over his handling of classified documents, including wilful retention of national defence information. A spokesman for Mr Smith said that the justice department has authorised an appeal. Dozens of classified files were found in Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, including in a shower and storage room, after he left the White House in 2021. ""The Court is convinced that Special Counsel’s Smith’s prosecution of this action breaches two structural cornerstones of our constitutional scheme—the role of Congress in the appointment of constitutional officers, and the role of Congress in authorizing expenditures by law,” Judge Cannon concluded in her 93-page order. The former president faced multiple felony counts over his alleged mishandling of classified documents.  The 37-count indictment accused Mr Trump of keeping files at his Florida estate and lying to investigators. It alleged he then tried to obstruct the investigation into the handling of the documents. He was charged alongside aide Walt Nauta and former employee Carlos de Oliveira, who had also pleaded not guilty.  Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Mr Smith in 2022 to oversee two federal investigations into the former president. Judge Cannon said in her ruling that this decision applies to this case and not a second one overseen by Mr Smith over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The former president's lawyers did not make a similar request to dismiss that case.  The Trump-appointed Florida judge had recently indefinitely postponed the federal classified documents trial, saying there were significant questions over trial evidence.  Legal experts have debated the strengths and weakness of the two federal criminal cases brought by Mr Smith.  On Monday, Judge Cannon stepped in and said those details did not matter. She held that the mere existence of special counsels - how they are appointed and how they are funded - violates the US Constitution. Judge Cannon's ruling cuts against the ruling of judges in other US courts that have dealt with these specially appointed prosecutors.  It draws from theories advanced by some conservative legal scholars and, most notably, by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in the top court's recently decided presidential immunity case. In that case, the Supreme Court said former presidents, including Mr Trump, are immune from criminal prosecution for ""official acts"".  Judge Cannon cited three times in her decision a concurring opinion by Justice Thomas in the Supreme Court ruling in which he questioned whether there was a legal basis for naming special counsel. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told the BBC on Monday that Judge Cannon's ruling was ""stunning, to say the least"". While Judge Cannon said her ruling was limited to this case, Mr Rahmani said it casts doubt on the appointment of special counsels in other cases.  That includes the case of Hunter Biden - President Joe Biden's son - who was investigated by a special counsel and convicted on gun charges last month.  But a key difference is that the special counsel in that case, David Weiss, is a US attorney for Delaware who, unlike Mr Smith, was nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. As well has having the right to an appeal, Mr Smith can also ask for a new judge to be assigned to the case.  Mr Smith's spokesman said: ""The dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the Attorney General is statutorily authorized to appoint a Special Counsel.  ""The Justice Department has authorized the Special Counsel to appeal the court’s order."" Legal experts say Judge Cannon's ruling is likely to be overturned but that the further delay to the case could prove beneficial to Mr Trump's campaign.  ""Her ruling has no chance of being sustained on appeal as it conflicts with decisions of the Supreme Court and other lower courts, but it will have the effect of preventing any more embarrassing revelations before the election,"" said David Super, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.  Judge Cannon's decision also comes as Republicans gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the Republican National Convention, where Mr Trump will accept the party's nomination for president.  The US election is on 5 November. On Monday, Mr Trump said on his social media site that the dismissal of the case ""should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts"".  ""Let us come together to END all Weaponization of our Justice System, and Make America Great Again!"" While many Republican lawmakers cheered the decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, described the dismissal as a ""breathtakingly misguided ruling"".  In May, Mr Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records in a New York hush-money case. He is due to be sentenced in September.  He has also been charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy against the rights of citizens, in the 2020 election case.  Mr Trump and some 18 other defendants are also accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his very narrow defeat in the state of Georgia in the 2020 election in a separate case.  He has denied any wrongdoing. ",2024-07-15 23:10:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5rpdrxevro,"Madeline Halpert, Ana Faguy and Anthony Zurcher in Milwaukee,",2024-07-15 17:10:38,
397,"'I was saved by luck or God,' Trump says","Former US President Donald Trump has said he is ""supposed to be dead"" after Saturday night's assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.  In one of his first interviews since the incident, Mr Trump told conservative US media he felt that he had been saved ""by luck or by God"".  “The most incredible thing was that I happened to not only turn [my head] but to turn at the exact right time and in just the right amount,"" he said, adding that the bullet that grazed his ear could have easily killed him. ""I’m supposed to be dead, I’m not supposed to be here,” he said. A spectator was killed in the attack, while two other people were seriously injured. The gunman, who also died, has been named as Thomas Matthew Crooks.  Mr Trump described the moment he looked up at the crowd after realising he had been shot. “The energy coming from the people there in that moment, they just stood there. It’s hard to describe what that felt like, but I knew the world was looking.  ""I knew that history would judge this, and I knew I had to let them know we are OK,” he told the Washington Examiner. Speaking as he prepared to board a flight to the upcoming Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he is expected to be confirmed as the party's candidate for president, Mr Trump said he now had a ""chance to bring the country together"". He said his speech would now be completely different instead of the ""humdinger"" aimed mostly at current President Joe Biden's policies he had previously planned.  “Had [Saturday's attack] not happened, this would’ve been one of the most incredible speeches. “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now. It is a chance to bring the country together.” Earlier, Mr Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he had intended to delay his trip to Wisconsin by two days. But he added that he was sticking to his original schedule as: ""I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling"". Mr Trump said that the assassination attempt ""has had an impact"" on him. Little is known about the motivation of Crooks, the 20-year-old would-be assassin who was shot dead by the Secret Service at the scene.  The FBI has said that while its investigation suggests Crooks acted alone, it would continue to look into whether the kitchen worker had received help.  The spectator who was killed in Saturday's attack has been named as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief who died trying to protect his family.

412,Stars pay tribute to 'force of nature'  Doherty,"Shannen Doherty has been remembered as a ""beloved"" actress with ""heart, courage and kindness"", following her death from cancer at the age of 53. Doherty was known for roles in 1990s teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210 and supernatural series Charmed. Jason Priestley, who played her twin brother on 90210, wrote on Instagram he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news. ""She was a force of nature and I will miss her,"" he said. ""Sending love and light to her family in this dark time."" Jennie Garth, who played Kelly, the sometime love rival of Doherty's character Brenda, said she was ""still processing my tremendous grief over the loss of my long-time friend Shannen, the woman I have often described as one of the strongest people I have ever known"". ""We were so often pitted against each other - but none of that reflected the truth of our real relationship, which was one built on mutual respect and admiration,"" Garth wrote. ""She was courageous, passionate, determined and very loving and generous. I will miss her and will always honour her deeply in my heart and in my memories. My heart breaks for her family and [her dog] Bowie and all the people who loved her."" Buffy the Vampire Slayer star Sarah Michelle Gellar, a good friend, posted: ""How do you possibly find the right words to sum up 30 years of friendship? ""I keep reminding myself it only hurts this much because, there was so much love. Thank you, for all your kind words and support."" Recalling Doherty's love of pets, Gellar asked well-wishers to donate to an animal charity in her memory. ""I know that would make our girl happy."" Doherty's death comes five years after that of her fellow Beverly Hills, 90210 star, Luke Perry. Gabrielle Carteris, who played Andrea in the hit series, paid tribute to Doherty, writing: ""So young - so sad. May you RIP Shannon. I know Luke is there with open arms to love you."" Tori Spelling, who played Donna, posted a photo of herself and Doherty, alongside a string of broken-heart emojis and the message: ""I don't have outwards words yet... but we knew and that's what matters."" Another Beverly Hills 90210 co-star, Brian Austin Green, addressed his tribute to ""Shan, my sister"". ""You loved me through everything. You were a big part of my understanding of love,"" he wrote.  ""I'll miss you more than I know how to process right now. Thank you for the gift of you."" Carol Potter, who played Brenda's mother, Cindy, wrote Doherty had ""gone too soon"". ""Throughout, she stayed true to herself and gave us an example of courage and perseverance in facing her own death,"" Potter said. ""May she rest in peace."" On Charmed, Doherty played one of three sisters who were witches. Rose McGowan, who replaced Doherty in the show, as half-sister Paige, wrote she ""had the heart of a lion"". ""My head bows to this warrior on her journey home,"" McGowan wrote. ""Her intense will to live places in her in the hall of legends. Forever our sister."" Alyssa Milano, who played sister Phoebe, acknowledged the pair's ""complicated relationship"", with reports they had fallen out on set, leading to Doherty's departure. ""But at its core was someone I deeply respected and was in awe of,"" Milano added in a statement. ""She was a talented actress, beloved by many, and the world is less without her. My condolences to all who loved her."" Another Charmed co-star, Brian Krause, wrote: ""You showed me what strength is. You taught me to be fearless and live with purpose, to know your value and stick to your determination. Forever loved. Truly heartbroken."" Others paying tribute included actress Olivia Munn, herself diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year, who was ""absolutely heartbroken"". ""We bonded through a shared battle and a desire to help other women,"" she wrote. ""Looking back on the last text she sent me, just a couple months ago, she asked how I was doing and if she could do anything for me. ""True to form, Shannen was offering her support even though she was in the final stage of fighting this horrific disease."" Doherty had faced the disease with ""such dignity, strength and grace"", Munn added. Actress Kate Beckinsale said on Instagram: ""Love you. Fly high lovely kind sweetheart woman. This hits hard. Your heart, courage and kindness will be so missed."" And Oscar winner Viola Davis wrote: ""Your bravery and ability to share your cancer journey left something 'in' people. Rest well. God bless your loved ones.""",2024-07-15 23:10:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7ew9lrdlxo,"Ian Youngs,",2024-07-15 10:10:39,
411,Israeli strike on central Gaza school reportedly kills 22,"At least 22 Palestinians were killed and 100 wounded in a strike on Sunday on a UN-run school in central Gaza being used as a shelter by displaced people, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The Israeli military said it had targeted a number of Hamas “terrorists” operating from Abu Oraiban School in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp. Witnesses told BBC Arabic there were no armed fighters there and that children were among the casualties. It was the fifth attack on or near to schools in eight days. Residents said there were fresh air and artillery strikes in central Gaza on Monday, with five people reportedly killed when a house in Maghazi refugee camp was hit. The Israeli military said its aircraft had struck dozens of “terror targets” across the territory over the past day. Meanwhile, Hamas said indirect negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel were “ongoing” in the wake of an air strike in the southern al-Mawasi humanitarian area on Saturday that the health ministry said killed more than 90 people. The Israeli military said it had targeted a compound where the head of Hamas’s armed wing, Mohammed Deif, was hiding with the commander of its Khan Younis Brigade, Rafa Salama. The military has announced that Salama was killed, but said it is too early to conclude whether Deif also died. Hamas has said Deif is in good health. A US State Department spokesman said Antony Blinken expressed serious concerns about the recent civilian casualties during a meeting with two key Israeli officials on Monday. The US Secretary of State spoke with with national security advisor, Tzachi Hanegbi, and Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, who confirmed that Israel was still committed to reaching a ceasefire deal under terms laid out by Joe Biden in May. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 38,660 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. According to the UN, an estimated 1.9 million people - 90% of Gaza’s population - have been forced to flee their homes, including some who have been displaced up to 10 times. Thousands were reportedly sheltering at Abu Oraiban School, which is run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), when it was it struck on Sunday afternoon. A displaced woman told BBC Arabic that she had been lighting a fire to cook in a corridor when a nearby room was hit. “As soon as the explosion occurred the walls of the room collapsed on us,” she said. “I saw a little boy whose leg was bleeding and a dismembered corpse which people covered with blankets. I also saw a little boy lying in a pool of blood, with his whole face bleeding.” She added: “I quickly ran out of the school. I found my aunt at the school gate, hugging her burnt young son. When I left the school, I saw many injured people lying on the ground and bodies torn to pieces.” Another resident said his family had been living at the school for six months because UN facilities were supposed to be safe. “There are no armed men and no reason to strike schools this way,” he added. “The dead and injured people are mainly women and children staying at this school.” Video footage filmed by a freelance cameraman working for BBC Arabic later on Sunday showed hundreds of people walking past the rubble of a destroyed structure in one corner of the school compound. A heavily damaged staircase could also be seen through two large holes in a wall of the adjoining three-storey school building. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Hamas fighters had used the school as “a hideout and operational infrastructure” from which attacks against its troops were directed and carried out. “Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken in order to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions and additional intelligence,” it added. The IDF also accused Hamas of systematically violating international law by exploiting civilians and civilian structures as “human shields” - an accusation the group has denied. A spokesman for Gaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence force, told AFP news agency on Sunday evening that 15 people were killed and that most were women and children. On Monday, the health ministry said the death toll had risen to 22, but it did not provide any further details. Hamas condemned the Israeli strike as what it called an “extension of the genocide” against displaced Palestinians. The IDF has acknowledged carrying out five strikes on or near to schools sheltering displaced people since 6 July. It has said they targeted Hamas politicians, police officers and fighters using them as bases. Last Tuesday, hospital officials said at least 29 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a camp for displaced people outside a school in the town of Abasan al-Kabira, near the southern city of Khan Younis. A total of 20 people, including a senior Hamas government official, were reportedly killed in three earlier strikes at two other Unrwa-run schools in Nuseirat and a church-run school in Gaza City.",2024-07-15 23:10:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1631w5n9vo,"David Gritten,",2024-07-15 16:10:39,
410,Violence erupts at Dublin site earmarked for asylum seekers,"Fifteen people have appeared at a special court sitting in Dublin following violence during  a protest at a site which had been earmarked for asylum seekers. Some protestors set pallets and construction machinery alight at the former Crown Paints factory in Coolock in north Dublin, resulting in a large fire. It is understood work was due to begin on the Malahide Road site later in the week. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris described the disturbances as ""reprehensible"". The 15 people who appeared at Dublin District Court on Monday evening were charged with public order offences, including failure to comply with the orders of a garda (police officer) and with threatening or abusive behaviour. All 15 were released on conditional bail, provided they stay away from the scene of the disorder They are all due to appear in court again on 18 September. Another four people who were arrested are due to appear in court on Tuesday morning. More than 200 gardaí were deployed to the incident. Three Garda cars were been damaged, one of which was set on fire, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported. It said pepper spray was used by police as a security guard and a number of gardaí were injured during clashes with protesters. Petrol bombs and fireworks were thrown, mattresses were set on fire damaging a JCB and fires were lit on the roads during the disturbances.  Gardaí described the disturbances as a public order incident and the road was closed for a period. They said officers were ""subjected to both verbal and physical abuse throughout the day, which escalated into rocks, fireworks and other objects being launched towards them"". ""A number of fires were lit and official Garda vehicles seriously damaged,"" a spokesperson said. ""As the situation intensified, members of An Garda Síochána used force to defend themselves as part of an escalated response to the situation."" Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said: it had been a difficult day for his officers and condemned what happened. ""We have seen attacks on gardaí, criminal damage and offences of serious public disorder,"" he said. ""All of these will be fully investigated. We have 15 people charged and we will have further charges overnight.""  The Irish justice minister said she was ""appalled at the criminal behaviour that took place in Coolock"". Helen McEntee said anybody involved would face ""the full rigours of the law"". Dublin city councillor Mícheál Mac Donncha described the incident as ""deplorable"" and that ""violence, intimidation and arson should have no place in our communities"". ""The burning of vehicles and attempted burning of the building are violent criminal acts and must be strongly condemned,"" the Sinn Féin representative said. He said the Department of Integration had said the site was being developed to accommodate families seeking international protection. “Those responsible should desist immediately,"" he added. ""This is an effort to spread fear and hate in our communities and the vast majority of decent people want nothing to do with it.""",2024-07-15 23:10:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvww23nxo,Unknown,2024-07-15 22:19:39,
409,Why hurricanes are moving dangerously slowly,"The behaviour of the world's most powerful storms is evolving. To adapt to more destructive hurricanes, we need to know how they're changing. Fuelled by heat from ocean waters, hurricanes are sometimes known as nature's steam engines. As they barrel over the oceans, they turn its heat into brutal kinetic energy that flattens islands and inundates coastal cities, taking months of urgent repair work to heal. Ocean temperatures are now breaking all records, and these ""engines"" are responding accordingly, cutting different paths across the ocean, slowing down, and becoming less predictable and more dangerous.  Now there's a race to understand exactly how hurricanes are rewriting the rules and patterns we've seen before, in the hope of learning how we can adapt. There's a distinct seasonal cycle to hurricanes in the Atlantic, with very few or none at all in winter, and a peak in September. A strong, early start to the hurricane season is in line with what we would expect with climate change, says James Kossin, a climate and atmospheric scientist retired from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ""Hurricanes themselves just respond to the environment that they're sitting in,"" Kossin says. ""And so if you make the environment in June look like the environment that would normally be in August or September, then the hurricanes will simply behave as though it's August or September. They don't have a calendar."" The extraordinarily warm ocean conditions we're seeing now are driven by climate change, though there are other factors making this season especially active, such as the present transition from El Nino to La Nina, which tends to boost storm activity. ""In a warming climate, we would expect the waters to be at the warmth that we need for hurricane earlier in the year,"" says Kristen Corbosiero, associate professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany in New York. ""So it's certainly possible that we will see earlier seasons and longer hurricane seasons moving forward."" While the intense early start to the 2024 season with Hurricane Beryl is in line with what climate scientists might expect to see with climate change, it's too early to observe a consistent shift in the season. ""[It's] not something that appears clearly in the data yet,"" says Suzana Camargo, professor of ocean and climate physics at Columbia University. 'Shear is death'  One of the strongest storms to form recently in the Atlantic did so under conditions that ought to have prevented a hurricane from forming, says Hugh Willoughby, research professor in earth and environment at Florida International University. In September 2023, at the peak of the Atlantic season, Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified into a category five storm. At the time, an El Niño was in effect, which generally has a stifling effect on storms in the Atlantic due to greater wind shear and atmospheric stability. ""Shear is death for hurricanes,"" says Willoughby. Vertical wind shear is the change in wind speed and direction at different heights – high wind shear disturbs the structure of a hurricane. ""Imagine you've got a turbine engine – shear knocks some of the blades out,"" says Willoughby. So for a category five like Hurricane Lee to form despite considerable shear came as ""a nasty surprise"". The extraordinary ocean warmth in September 2023 may have somehow overwhelmed the influence of shear, says Willoughby, though it's not entirely clear why. ""We, the theoreticians, need to think about that."" The vast majority of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic don't reach their potential, says Willoughby. In the relatively tight constraints of the Atlantic Basin a storm will often make landfall before it reaches peak intensity, or it will run into high wind shear, which helps dissipate the storm. ""But when everything goes right it'll intensify rapidly and reach its maximum potential intensity, which is defined by the ocean surface temperature below the hurricane,"" says Willoughby. There is ""a heck of a lot of evidence"" that intensification rates are increasing as oceans get hotter, providing more fuel to the storms, says Kossin. ""It all comes down to the amount of fuel available,"" he says. ""It's kind of like changing the jets in a carburettor. You change the jets to allow for more fuel to come in and mix with the air, you're going to get more horsepower. You're going to be able to go from zero to 60 faster. And that's your intensification."" The peak intensity of hurricanes has also been rising with climate change. In a 2020 study, Kossin found the intensity of storms between 1979 and 2017 increased by about 6% per decade. Storms are now 25% more likely than they were 40 years ago to reach the threshold of 111 mph (180km/h) required to be classified as a major hurricane. Overall, the proportion of tropical cyclones of category three or more is likely increasing, according to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). ""The ocean temperature defines the maximum intensity the hurricane can reach,"" says Willoughby. In May 2024, a BBC analysis found the world's ocean temperatures had broken records every single day for the preceding year. Even as the wind speeds within a hurricane speed up, the movement of hurricanes along their paths over ocean and land is slowing down. In a 2018 study, Kossin found that hurricanes near the US have slowed by around 17% since the beginning of the 20th Century. Tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific slowed down by as much as 20%. It's thought that the reason for the slowdown is the uneven way that climate change is heating the globe, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the world. As a result, the difference in temperature between the Arctic and the tropics is narrowing. ""It's that temperature gradient that drives the winds,"" says Kossin. ""The stronger the gradient, the stronger the winds."" You can think of hurricanes like a cork in a stream, he says. ""They just go where the wind takes them."" And if you slow down the winds, you're going to slow down the storms as they move along their path.    A slow-moving hurricane has more time to dump rain in a given location – think of the difference between passing a garden hose quickly over a flowerbed or holding it in place for longer. ""What really is going to give you a lot of rain is when you slow these [storms] down,"" says Kossin. ""When they stop, or what we call 'stall out', it's just devastating because you get inundated for days."" The damage caused by wind, too, increases with its duration – the longer it blows against structures, the more likely it will knock them over. ""It's just bad having a hurricane stick around very long,"" Kossin says. ""You want it to get out of your neighbourhood."" There's also the fact that warmer air can hold more moisture – around 7% more per degree Celsius, which means hurricanes can become even wetter. As climate change increases temperatures, that extra moisture makes a difference – but the effect is small compared with the difference made by a hurricane that's stalling out, says Kossin. For this reason, Kossin says he sees this slowdown as the most dangerous of all the ways climate change is altering hurricanes. ""That's a really big deal."" As well as very high temperatures at the uppermost layer of the ocean, things get worse when the layers below start to warm up too. If the upper warm layer is shallow then as the hurricane passes over, cooler water from below gets churned up and mixes in, says Corbosiero, cooling the surface water down. ""But if that warm water extends to a deeper layer as the hurricane goes by and churns up the water, the [surface] water is still warm,"" says Corbosiero, allowing the storm to continue with force. These are conditions that we're seeing in the Atlantic. ""In addition to warm surface waters, we also have very deep warm waters right now,"" she says. ""So [hurricanes] are able to intensify faster and not stop intensifying because they're not encountering cold water."" There's a danger of getting  this tunnel vision when considering the ways hurricanes are changing, says Kossin, with the focus on strength and intensification. ""People don't talk about track enough,"" he says. ""And I think that it's by far more dangerous."" In a 2014 paper, Kossin and colleagues found that in the northern hemisphere, storms had moved north by 53km (33 miles) per decade. In the southern hemisphere, they had moved south at 62km (39 miles) per decade. In all, the hurricanes were moving about one degree of latitude away from the tropics per decade. This could expose communities to extreme storms in regions previously unused to them. Kossin points to the migration of tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific, where he has measured a slight decrease in risk around the Philippines, but an increase to the north near Japan. ""The Philippines experiences [cyclones] all the time, so they're somewhat adapted to it. Japan experiences them, but not all the time,"" says Kossin. ""So now we're saying that they're going to start seeing stronger storms reaching them than before. The effect that that has on risk is really substantial."" The US's protective barrier is failing  Climate change is also altering the patterns of wind shear over the Atlantic. ""There's a pattern of wind shear that is sort of like two bullseyes,"" says Kossin. One elongated bullseye sits in the Main Development Region (MDR), a strip of the tropics hurricanes move through and intensify in. The second bullseye is just off the east coast of Florida, extending up to the Carolinas. ""Those two have a kind of a seesawing effect,"" says Kossin. ""When the shear is high in the MDR it tends to be low off of the coast there, and vice versa."" The shear in the MDR is linked to sea surface temperatures – warmer waters here generally means less shear. In turn, that often means greater shear off the US coast – resulting in a shield of messy winds that acts as an ""intensification barrier"", as Kossin discovered in 2017. While this barrier unfortunately does nothing to weaken storms as they hit communities in the Caribbean, it does offer the US some protection. ""So when the conditions are conducive for lots of storms forming and intensifying in the MDR, as they approach the US, they run into this higher shear and it tends to weaken them,"" says Kossin. ""Fortunately, for now."" This could well be what happened to Hurricane Beryl as it approached the US coast and rapidly weakened, says Kossin. But this protective barrier does not appear to be a permanent fixture. In a paper authored by Kossin and Camargo and colleagues at Columbia University, the researchers looked at what the future might hold for this barrier.   ""Sure enough, it seems like the news is always bad, right?"" says Kossin. ""It's never good. It could have been good. We could have found that climate change increases the barrier. But it doesn't. It erodes it."" Loss of a smog shield In addition to greenhouse gas levels rising, a decrease in air pollution in Europe and the US since the 1970s is thought to have had an unintended consequence – warming the air over the Atlantic further. Previously, high levels of sulphate pollutants from industry mixed over the Atlantic Basin, hindering sunlight from hitting the ocean, says Kossin. ""And that has a cooling effect."" Climate change has been well underway since the industrial revolution, ""but we've been suppressing that warming with this pollution"", says Kossin. After the remarkable success in reducing industrial pollution, that cooling effect reduced. More like this: • How vetiver can stabilise crumbling Caribbean slopes • The unlikely birthplace of the most destructive hurricanes • The indigenous Philippines houses that withstand typhoons There is debate over just how much industrial smog may have influenced temperatures. Willoughby believes the impact was small, with other factors playing a more important role on ocean temperatures. Some studies have found, however, that industrial smog's influence on ocean temperatures is underappreciated, with clean-up efforts in China potentially contributing to periodic warm ""warm blob"" events in the north-east Pacific. There are other ways too that hurricanes are becoming more extreme and bringing greater risk. ""Sea level rise is also happening underneath everything we're talking about, and since hurricanes become dangerous as they move onto a coast, you always have to add that on to the problem,"" says Kossin. One study found storm surge waves from hurricanes in the Caribbean, Mexico and the US had grown in area by 80% since 1979 – and globally, storm surge waves were also getting around 3% higher per decade. But technologies can help save lives in communities where hurricanes make landfall, while longer-term changes could also limit loss of life and property. ""One of the issues I would focus on is [limiting] further development of the coastal regions,"" says Carmargo. ""Policies that lead to huge real estate development in the coastal regions should not continue. The more people and more infrastructure in regions that are typically in the path of hurricanes lead to more impacts."" For those who do live in the paths of hurricanes, making broad adaptations to buildings and developments may help preserve homes and infrastructure. Reliable early-warning systems, meanwhile, can provide a life-saving head-start to safety. There could also be natural solutions to help bolster island and coastal areas, from planting grass that binds slopes together to replenishing lost oyster beds. ""Adaptation is so important, and you know, may ultimately turn out to be the most important thing,"" says Kossin. ""Because we can't suddenly turn off climate change and have everything go back to the way it was. There's an inertia to the system that we can't really get past. And so adaptation is going to be a big part of it."" -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

406,Xi tackles slow growth as economy 'hits the brakes',"China's economy stumbled in the second quarter, official data shows, just as the country's top leaders gathered for a key meeting to address its sluggish growth.   It grew 4.7% in the three months to June, falling short of expectations after a stronger start in the first three months of 2024. The government's annual growth target is around 5%.  ""China’s economy hit the brakes in the June quarter,"" said Heron Lim at Moody's Analytics, adding that analysts are hoping for solutions from the meeting under way in Beijing, also called the Third Plenum.  The world's second-largest economy is facing a prolonged property crisis, steep local government debt, weak consumption and high unemployment. Past outcomes of the Plenum have changed the course of history in China - in 1978, then leader Deng Xiaoping began opening China's markets to the world, and in 2013 President Xi Jinping hinted at loosening the controversial one-child policy.   And so there are expectations of this year's Plenum, where  Mr Xi is presiding over a closed-door gathering of 370-plus high-ranking Chinese Communist Party members.  The rhetoric on state-controlled media has certainly been encouraging.   An editorial in The Global Times said a ""wide range of reform-focused polices"" are ""high on the agenda"" and would usher in a ""new chapter"". Xinhua referred to ""comprehensive"" and ""unprecedented"" reforms. The editorial in the People's Daily was headlined on a ""new era of reform and opening up"", invoking the very phrase Deng coined in 1978.  Observers, however, are unsure of how much room there is for bold ideas or debate in the Party under Mr Xi's heavily-centralised leadership. Some see the meeting as a mere rubber-stamping exercise for decisions that have already been made. Economists are also sceptical the meeting will deliver a quick fix.  It has ""little impact on near-term growth,"" says Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at Vanguard, because its focus will be on longer-term and more significant reforms to ""unleash the long-term growth potential"".  Still, analysts will be watching for announcements that signal the Party's economic priorities.  Separate data on Monday showed that prices for new homes in June fell at the fastest pace in nine years.   This is more evidence of the crisis that has engulfed China's property sector and led to the demise of giants such as Evergrande. The fear is that it could spread to other parts of the economy. ""There are more than 4,000 banks in China and over 90% are smaller, regional banks which are highly exposed to the housing market and local government debt,"" says Shanghai-based economist Dan Wang. She believes Party leaders will  ""push for consolidation of small banks"".  Another issue is falling prices - a symptom of weak demand. Producer prices continued to drop in the last month, while consumer prices rose by a mere 0.2%, the slowest pace in three months. Meanwhile, retail sales in June grew by just 2%, which is below expectations and a sign that consumers are still cautious about spending and uncertain of the future.   ""A major concern is the loss of household, business, and investor confidence in the government’s ability to navigate the perilous economic environment,"" said Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. Still, questions remain about Beijing's willingness to deliver the sort of solution that would satisfy observers and the markets.  ""The government is reluctant to turn to short-term stimulus plans such as cash transfer to families,"" Dan Wang said.

That is in line with Beijing's bets on high-tech industries such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence and chip-making, and exports to revive the economy.

405,Kagame seeks fourth term as Rwandan president,"Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, feared and admired in equal measure, is seeking to extend his 24-year rule in an election analysts say he will win by a landslide. He has dominated every election since becoming president in 2000, with over 90% of the vote. In 2017 he won with a staggering 99% in an election criticised by human rights groups. Mr Kagame, 66, is accused of not allowing any real opposition and ruthlessly targeting his critics, even outside the country.  He faces the only two contenders who were authorised to run - other candidates were barred by the state-run electoral commission.  Mr Kagame cast his vote without speaking to reporters.  He has been the real force in Rwanda since his rebel forces took power at the end of the 1994 genocide which killed some 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  Since then, he has been praised for overseeing the country's dramatic economic revival and unifying the country. ""Rwanda was 30 years ago essentially written off - but thanks to some extent to the leadership under Kagame and his ruling party, Rwanda managed to build some stability,"" Dr Felix Ndahinda, a scholar on the Great Lakes region, told the BBC. Mr Kagame has always fiercely defended Rwanda's record on human rights, saying his country respects political freedoms. But one analyst told the BBC the election was a mere ""formality"".  About nine million people are registered to vote, according to the electoral body, and at least two million are first-time voters.  Counting has already begun at polling stations and provisional results might be announced by Tuesday morning. Voters are electing the president and 53 members of the lower House of Parliament on Monday, while 27 other MPs will be chosen on Tuesday. “I am very excited about voting for my first time, I can’t wait,” Sylvia Mutoni told the BBC. For most young people in Rwanda, Mr Kagame is the only leader they have ever known.  Even while vice-president and defence minister from 1994 to 2000 he was the country's real leader, and has been president since 2000. The two opposition candidates - Frank Habineza, of the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana - both ran in the 2017 election, where they took just over 1% of the vote between them. But they are undeterred.  Mr Habineza cast his vote in the capital, Kigali, on Monday morning and said he hoped his party can get 20 MPs - 10 times the number of seats his party secured in 2017. Before the election, he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast: ""I believe democracy is a process.  ""People still have a fear of expressing their opinions. I'm fighting for freedom of speech, freedom of the media,"" he said.  And some Rwandans are listening to him. One voter told the BBC he would not be voting for the incumbent president.  Celestin Mutuyeyezu, 28, used to support Mr Kagame, but this election has been swayed by Mr Habineza. “He said great things on fighting unemployment, and he’s got me,"" he said. But defeating President Kagame may prove difficult.  Diane Rwigara, an outspoken critic of the president, was barred from running in the election. She was also disqualified in 2017.  ""Rwanda is portrayed as a country where the economy has been growing. But on the ground, it's different. People do lack the basics of life, food, water, shelter,"" she told the BBC. The electoral commission said she had failed to provide correct documentation. Though the country continues to struggle with high rates of youth unemployment, it is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. Mr Kagame is credited for Rwanda’s remarkable economic transformation and stability over the last three decades.  Rwanda is known globally for its clean capital city and having the world's highest proportion of female MPs, 61%.  In the book Rwanda, Inc. American authors Patricia Crisafulli and Andrea Redmond describe Mr Kagame more as a company CEO than a political leader because of “his drive for excellence” in every sector in the country. He is also a shrewd politician.  Despite often criticising the West, he tries to cultivate useful allies - for example by working with the UK on its now-abandoned scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. Rwanda has also been flexing its soft power on the international stage, by building its appeal through sports, culture, and entertainment.  The small East African country is home to the African Basketball League, which is a partnership with the NBA. It hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2022 and international stars like Kendrick Lamar have played concerts there. But Mr Kagame's diplomacy also has a very tough side. The election comes days after a UN report said there were some 4,000 Rwandan troops in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they are accused of backing the M23 rebel group. Rwanda did not deny the allegation and told the BBC the DR Congo government lacked the political will to resolve the crisis in its mineral-rich east, which has witnessed decades of unrest. On the campaign trail Mr Kagame promised to protect Rwanda from “external aggression” amid tensions with neighbouring DR Congo and Burundi.

404,Is Brazil's Brics-building worth it?,"It's been more than a year-and-a-half since Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva returned to the country's presidency, back from the political dead after his conviction on corruption charges was dramatically annulled. In that time, President Lula's comeback has given renewed force to one of the world's most unlikely economic alliances - the Brics, a grouping that unites Brazil with Russia, India, China and South Africa. In his previous time as president from 2003 to 2010, Lula was instrumental in efforts to weld the Brics into a geopolitical entity, and an emerging counterweight to the West. Now the bloc has momentum on its side once again. It's come to be known as Brics Plus, after the original members agreed at a watershed summit in Johannesburg in August last year to admit a handful of new joiners, including Saudi Arabia and Iran. Not bad for a grouping that was originally willed into being by sheer high-concept financial whimsy, the brainchild of economist Jim O'Neill, who saw it more as an  investment opportunity than a new gang of nations. ""When the Brics were invented, it was pretty much an asset class,"" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""But it caught on in Brazil, because it directly spoke to Lula's aspirations in foreign policy."" At the Johannesburg meeting, Lula was particularly bullish about the group's long-term economic prospects. “We have already surpassed the G7 and account for 32% of global GDP in purchasing power parity,"" he said.  ""Projections indicate that emerging and developing markets will be those that will show the highest growth rate in the coming years,"" he went on.  ""This shows that the dynamism of the economy is in the global south and the Brics is its driving force.” But that is disingenuous on Lula's part, to say the least. As has been pointed out by the originator of the Bric acronym, who now rejoices in the title of Baron O'Neill of Gatley, all the economic growth in the group has actually come from Xi Jinping's China and Narendra Modi's India. ""None of the other Brics has performed anywhere near as well as those two,"" he said in an article written in reaction to the bloc's expansion. ""Brazil and Russia account for around the same share of global GDP as they did in 2001, and South Africa is not even the largest economy in Africa [Nigeria has surpassed it].""  As he also points out, China ""dominates the Brics by being twice the size of all the others combined"", in much the same way that the US dominates the G7. So what does slow-growth Brazil gain from being dragged along in China's economic slipstream?  Rodrigo Zeidan, a Brazilian economist based at China's New York University Shanghai, tells the BBC that Brazil and China alike see the Brics as a ""hedge"" in terms of global alliances, rather than as a top priority. ""The Brics right now, for Brazil, cost almost nothing,"" he says. ""So if the benefits are not high, it's fine. They are neither a big benefit nor a hindrance."" Since China is its biggest trading partner, Brazil is comfortable maintaining close relations with Beijing, even if the Brics grouping provides it with some ""strange bedfellows"", as Mr Zeidan puts it. Lula has certainly maintained an ambiguous position on Russia's war in Ukraine, but that is more due to Brazil's traditional neutrality in foreign policy than to a wish to support a fellow Brics nation. For Monica de Bolle at the Peterson Institute, herself a Brazilian economist, President Lula showed ""a lot of naivety"" in committing to the Brics because of his belief in furthering relations among the big so-called global south nations. As a result, Brazil has now acquired ""a China dependency"" that could harm it in other foreign policy relations, she says. ""If you are in the US, you know that the US stance on China is not going to change [whoever wins the presidential election in November],"" she adds. ""In either case, it's moving in the direction of greater anti-China sentiment. At some point, that's going to create additional reactions from China, which could put Brazil in a very difficult position, because it's perceived as being aligned with China."" One tangible gain for Brazil from the alliance comes in the shape of the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral lender founded by the Brics and described by Lula as ""a milestone in effective collaboration between emerging economies"". It is currently headed by Brazilian ex-President Dilma Rousseff. She was President Lula's political protegee, and succeeded him in 2011. But her time in office came to a chaotic end when she was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws. The NDB has not only returned her to public life, but since the bank's headquarters are in Shanghai, it makes her key to maintaining links between Brazil and China. ""Dilma is definitely huge in terms of political image. Having Dilma here in Shanghai is very important for strengthening Brazil-China relations,"" says Mr Zeidan. Brazil has also benefited directly from NDB money. In June, Ms Rousseff and Brazilian Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin signed a loan deal worth more than $1.1bn (£880m) to help pay for reconstruction after widespread floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Regarding the NDB and Russia, the bank put all transactions involving the country on hold in March 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the NDB has complied with international sanctions against Russia. But Russia is due to take over the rotating presidency of the bank in mid-2025 and there is some uncertainty over what will happen then. In the meantime, Ms Rousseff is not averse to attending financial gatherings in Russia, and shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has praised her work at the helm of the NDB. President Lula is a passionate advocate of the Brics as a means of reforming global governance and giving a greater voice to the developing world.  He has criticised the ""paralysis"" of global institutions, while praising the expansion of the Brics as strengthening the fight for more diverse perspectives. But other observers retort that the Brics are themselves paralysed by their own internal contradictions, with Russia at war in Ukraine, while China and India have their own mutual squabbles. Ultimately, says Ms de Bolle in Washington, the Brics are ""a heterogeneous group of countries that have nothing in common, apart from the fact that they are big"". ""The Brics have no clear agenda that has any real weight,"" agrees Mr Zeidan in Shanghai.  ""Right now, China doesn't ask much of Brazil. However, anything that China asks, Brazil does. ""It's fine to be part of the Brics when the stakes are low. But what if the stakes rise?"" In other words, the effect of the Brics, on Brazil and on the world, may be minor for now. But if China decides to become more assertive, that could change rapidly - and Brazil could be faced with some uncomfortable choices.",2024-07-15 23:10:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0venrydg8yo,"Robert Plummer,",2024-07-14 23:10:39,
407,Egyptian cyclist barred from Olympics over crash with team-mate,"An Egyptian track cyclist who collided with a rival team-mate will no longer compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics, after the Egyptian Olympic Committee (EOC) ruled that she should be barred over the incident. The EOC said Shahd Saeed, 19, was not eligible because of the one-year suspension from local competitions that was imposed by the Egyptian Cycling Federation in April. Many Egyptians had criticised her selection for the Olympics by the federation, whose president had said it was acting “in favour of Egypt”. In a TV interview following the EOC’s decision, Saeed admitted she was at fault for the crash with Ganna Eliwa but insisted it was “not deliberate”. “I wish I had represented Egypt in the Olympics and my efforts over three years had paid off,” she told a talk show. Eliwa, who is also 19, said she was happy that Saeed would be unable to compete. “It was expected,” she added. “Saeed does not deserve to be at Paris.” Eliwa was left concussed and with a broken right collarbone and severe cuts and bruises to the right-hand side of her body, according to a medical report, after she was pushed off her bike 300m (980ft) before the finishing line of an event in Suez on 27 April. In video footage of the incident, Saeed is seen riding behind Eliwa before she swerves, forcing Eliwa into the barrier. The latter underwent an operation to fix her right shoulder, suffered temporary loss of memory and is still unable to resume competitive cycling. Saeed said several times that it was an accident, but Eliwa said she never apologised for what happened. It was unclear what caused Saeed to swerve into her opponent. After an investigation into the incident, the Egyptian Cycling Federation suspended Saeed from the sport for one year and fined her the equivalent of $100 (£77) - the maximum penalty. Despite that, the federation still registered her for the track cycling at the Olympics. The decision sparked public anger in Egypt. Many social media users urged authorities to reconsider, with some saying the selection violated the values of Olympism - excellence, respect and friendship. In a statement issued late on Saturday, the EOC noted that the cycling federation had found that Saeed violated “the regulations, customs, values and ethics of sports” during April’s event. ""Shahd Saeed is not eligible to participate in any international competition, including the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, due to her one-year suspension until 26 April 2025,"" it said. The EOC also urged Egyptian media and public to support the remaining members of the national team at the Olympics.",2024-07-15 23:10:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe27re204zo,"David Gritten,",2024-07-15 12:10:39,
421,Police hunt mayor accused of being Chinese spy,"A small town mayor in the Philippines who has been accused of being a Chinese spy has gone into hiding, officials said.  Police could not carry out a warrant for the arrest of Alice Guo over the weekend as she was not at any of her known addresses.  Scam centres were uncovered in Ms Guo's town of Bamban in March, concealed in online casinos that cater to mainland Chinese. Her story has played out like a TV drama, as she had also been questioned on her Chinese parentage and suspicions that she was working as an ""asset"" or spy for Beijing. Ms Guo's case has gripped the nation as Manila and Beijing continue to spar over reefs and outcrops in the South China Sea. The Senate ordered the arrest of Ms Guo and some members of her family last Friday after she twice snubbed summons to appear in hearings on the scam centres. ""Show yourselves. Hiding will not erase the truth,"" Senator Risa Hontiveros, who is leading parliament's investigation on Ms Guo, said in a statement. Ms Guo has denied wrongdoing. She claims her Chinese father and Filipina mother raised her on their pig farm. But Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, who is part of the investigation, claims Ms Guo is a Chinese national whose real name is Guo Hua Ping, based on immigration records. ""She is hiding to evade arrest,"" Mr Gatchalian told local radio. ""Our tracker teams will continue looking for her."" On the day the arrest warrant was signed, Ms Guo posted a statement on Facebook, addressing her constituents and alluding to the fact that she would not be around. ""Sorry for not being physically present with each one of you. I miss you all,"" she said,  adding her absence would be ""temporary"". In the post, she added that she did not regret joining politics, even if it hurt her so much that she ""almost lost myself"". ""I am a Filipino with a big heart for Bamban. I love the Philippines very much,"" she said. Ms Guo's lawyer, Nicole Jamilla, told local television that her client would ""definitely"" cooperate with official investigations. Aside from the investigation by the Senate, Ms Guo is the subject of a separate anti-graft probe that has led to her suspension. The scam centres in Bamban have underscored how online casinos or Pogos (Philippine Online Gaming Operations) have been used as cover for text scams, human trafficking and other criminal activities. Crime rings hiding beneath Pogos have even gone to the extent of building hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery to fugitives who want new faces. Pogos flourished during the tenure of Rodrigo Duterte, whose presidency, which ended in 2022, was marked by close ties to China. But under current president Ferdinand Marcos, Pogos have come under close scrutiny. If proven that she is a Chinese citizen, Ms Guo would be not be eligible to serve as mayor. Only Filipino citizens are allowed to hold elective office. But this does not matter to her constituents who benefit from her social outreach programmes, that are widely documented on her social media pages. Ms Guo ""brought change"" to Bamban, and its people are thankful, resident Erica Miclat told ANC television.

425,What happens next with Southgate decision?,"This video can not be played 'We have to hold our hands up' - Southgate says Spain were deserved winners England manager Gareth Southgate said ""now was not the time"" to announce if he would stay on as manager after defeat by Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final. Southgate has been in charge since 2016, a reign that has taken in two World Cups and two European Championships. The Football Association wants him to stay, but his contract ends in December. Despite reaching the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup and two Euros finals, Southgate has faced some criticism. So what happens next? No-one can be sure about this. Southgate has a contract until December, so in theory there is no time pressure.  However, with clubs about to start pre-season and less than five weeks to the start of the 2024-25 Premier League campaign, there is an obvious reason why it would be beneficial to have clarity sooner rather than later. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 England England’s next game is against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in the Nations League on 7 September.  The September, October and November international double-headers are reserved for Nations League games.  The 2026 World Cup qualifying round draw is set to take place later this year with matches beginning in March 2025. The Football Association's technical director John McDermott will be a key figure.  McDermott was head of academy, coach and player development at Tottenham for 15 years before moving to the FA in 2020, initially as assistant technical director to Les Reed.  FA chief executive Mark Bullingham and chair Debbie Hewitt are the most senior non-football figures at the organisation. There is no David Dein or David Gill-type presence on the FA Board, someone with day-to-day expertise at the ‘sharp end’ of football administration.  EFL chair Rick Parry is on the FA Board and may provide useful input, while Jobi McAnuff is also on the FA Board. He had a 20-year playing career across eight clubs, as well as representing Jamaica. Almost certainly there will be an outline plan. But the FA has not been in this position since 2016, when Roy Hodgson resigned after the embarrassing Euros exit to Iceland.  Back then, Sam Allardyce came in but only lasted 67 days before he was sacked. Southgate was promoted from England Under-21 boss initially on an interim basis.  It is a measure of how much has changed since then that Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce were contenders for the job, while Greg Clarke was the FA chair and Martin Glenn the chief executive. Gareth Southgate has two European runners-up medals for England The FA has ploughed millions into St George's Park, with one of the stated aims for it to become an ""inspirational centre for coach education, raising standards in coaching and elevating it as a profession"". Still no English coach has won the Premier League.  No English coach was appointed into any of the five top-flight vacancies that existed this summer, although Leicester's Wales-born manager Steve Cooper did win the World Cup as England Under-17 coach in 2017. Eddie Howe has been the highest-placed English coach for the past two seasons with Newcastle finishing fourth in 2022-23 and seventh last term.  If Southgate is to leave, should the replacement be English - and also keep a keen eye on the development teams as Southgate has done - or someone from overseas, who is only interested in the senior team, as Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson did?  As Southgate can testify, the job is one of the most scrutinised in world football, so is top level experience - as a player, or manager, or both - essential?  These are the issues the FA must wrestle with as Southgate makes up his mind. As ever, getting rid of a coach is the easy bit. Sorting out a replacement is far more difficult.

424,Copa America - the 'party that almost became a tragedy',"This video can not be played Copa America: Argentina and Colombia in crowd trouble The 2024 Copa America was supposed to showcase the Americas' passion for football. But, as Argentine newspaper Ole put it, ""this party almost became a tragedy"". Hosted by the United States, in some of the biggest and best stadiums in world sport, the tournament was beset by problems. It featured poor pitches, half-empty stadiums and crowd trouble before ending in chaotic scenes on Sunday. The final between Argentina and Colombia was delayed by 80 minutes after ticketless fans forced their way into Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. Arrests were made after clashes with police and security personnel, while several supporters needed treatment from paramedics. It was far from the showpiece the organisers hoped for and raises concerns before the 2026 World Cup, set to be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. So what went wrong and what can be learned from an event Argentine media outlet Todo Noticias branded a ""world-class failure""? Problems were apparent in the opening game between Argentina and Canada. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni and players from both teams complained about the condition of the pitch in Atlanta. Eleven of the 14 host venues were NFL stadiums and six of them had grass pitches installed over an artificial surface. In some cases, the turf was laid just days before. The tournament is organised by Conmebol, South American football's governing body, which said it carried out tests before and after games that showed pitches were in good condition. But Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said in a news conference that they were ""a plague of liars"", that the training pitches provided ""were a disaster"", and that Scaloni and his players had been ""threatened"" not to speak out. Brazil’s Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr criticised both the standard of the pitches and refereeing, while the Football Federation of Chile (FFC) asked for referee Wilmar Roldan to be sanctioned for ""disastrous conduct"" during their final group game. Uruguay players then clashed with Colombia fans after their semi-final defeat, having gone into the stands to protect their families.  The Uruguay Football Association (AUF) said there were insufficient security measures in place at the game in Charlotte, where Colombian and Uruguayan fans were not segregated. Most of the games in the knockout stages were sold out, but crowds were significantly below capacity at 50% of the 32 games across the tournament. That was partly because of ticket prices. The average cost was estimated to be about $200 (£155), although tickets for certain games were far more expensive on US resale sites and because of dynamic ticket pricing. This video can not be played Fans climb into stadium air vents to get into a Copa America game Before Sunday's final, Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo had already complained about Colombian popstar Shakira performing a half-time show, meaning the  interval would last for 25 minutes rather than 15. Conmebol also issued a statement saying that only ticket holders would be allowed to enter the stadium campus before the 20:00 kick-off (local time). But as the scheduled kick-off time approached, a statement from a stadium spokesperson said that thousands of ticketless fans had ""attempted to forcibly enter the stadium"", which has a capacity of 65,000. Footage shows fans breaching the stadium gates, climbing over perimeter walls and fencing, and even through ventilation ducts. A stadium statement later explained that as gates were ""closed and re-opened strategically"", some fans ""continued to engage in illegal conduct - fighting police officers, breaking down walls and barricades and vandalising the stadium, causing significant damage to the property"". It had become overcrowded outside the stadium, with fans waiting in 31C heat, and a joint decision was made - for a short period - to allow fans in without scanning tickets ""to prevent stampedes and serious injury at the perimeter"". ""The gates were then closed once the threat of fans being crushed was alleviated,"" the statement added. ""At that time, the venue was at capacity and gates were not re-opened."" Players’ families were also involved in the chaos, and Argentina coach Scaloni said afterwards: ""We had to start a match without knowing where our family members were. It was very weird."" The game ultimately kicked off more than an hour late. With there being extra time as well as the half-time show, it did not finish until 00:09 local time. Women and children were involved in the overcrowding Speaking on Monday, James Reyes, chief of public safety for Miami-Dade County, said more than 800 law enforcement officers were present at the stadium.   ""Last night our law enforcement teams responded swiftly to handle an extremely challenging, dangerous situation posing life safety concerns for attendees,"" he said. ""We are working with the event organisers to conduct a comprehensive review of all safety and security protocols, as we continue to prepare for the World Cup in 2026."" He said 27 arrests were made and 55 people were ejected from the stadium.  Eight of the Copa America venues will also be used for the 2026 World Cup. They include the Hard Rock Stadium, which is set to host seven matches including a quarter-final and the third-place play-off. A stadium statement said that the venue will work with law enforcement to identify those responsible for Sunday's disorder and review the processes in place ""to ensure such an event never happens again"". It added that the number of law enforcement officers and security personnel on site was more than double that for regular sellout events. ""We understand there are disappointed ticket holders who were not able to enter the stadium after the perimeter was closed, and we will work in partnership with Conmebol to address those individual concerns,"" the statement read. ""Ultimately, there is nothing more important than the health and safety of all guests and staff, and that will always remain our priority."" While Conmebol is responsible for the Copa America, the World Cup is organised by the world governing body Fifa, so the North America-based Independent Supporters Council (ISC) is ""confident"" the 2026 tournament will welcome fans ""safely and adequately"". A statement added: ""While Copa America highlighted serious issues that could occur and make people apprehensive about making the journey to North America, we trust that the host cities and planning committees have taken note of those issues and are already anticipating and planning accordingly."" Conmebol said in a statement: ""We regret that the acts of violence caused by malicious individuals have tarnished a final that was ready to be a great sports celebration."" Conmebol also said it suggested procedures to stadium security organisers that were ""not taken into account"". Fifa have been approached for comment.

423,Body found in Jay Slater hunt near last phone location,"Search teams looking for Jay Slater in Tenerife have found a body near the last known location of the missing British teenager's mobile phone. The Guardia Civil said its officers and a mountain rescue unit found the body of a young man in the Masca area ""after 29 days of non-stop searching"".  The 19-year-old was last seen on 17 June, after visiting an Airbnb rented by two people he had been with at a music festival on the island.  A police statement said that ""initial evidence"" suggested the person found had ""suffered an accident or fall in the inaccessible zone"". It added that ""the discovery was possible thanks to the incessant and discreet search carried out by the Guardia Civil... in which the natural space was preserved so that it would not be filled with onlookers."" Police said that ""all the evidence"" suggested the remains found were those of ""the young British man who disappeared"". Full identification of the body is yet to be carried out, it added.  The charity LBT Global, which works with families of people missing overseas, said that the remains were found along with Mr Slater's clothes and possessions, close to his mobile phone's last known location. The group said it was supporting Mr Slater's family ""at this distressing time and ask for everyone to afford them space and privacy to come to terms with the news"". Mr Slater's father Warren Slater described his disappearance as ""a living hell"", while his mother Debbie Duncan told of her ""pain and agony"" as no trace could be found.  The search for Mr Slater since his disappearance has involved his family, friends, police and specialist mountain rescue teams as well as volunteers from several countries.  Most recently the family, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, was helped by a group of Dutch mountain rescuers.  In Mr Slater's hometown of Oswaldtwistle, news that the search had resulted in the discovery of a body was met with shock.  Paul Fitzpatrick, the landlord of the Hare And Hounds pub, told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""If it's true that it's him then we are all devastated for his family, his mum especially. ""She has been a good friend to us all, we've known Debbie for years. I've been here for 17 years... her boy then would have been a baby. ""It's horrible news if it is confirmed that it is him."" The Guardia Civil indicated in its statement that it was members of its Mountain Rescue and Intervention Group who located the ""lifeless body"" of a young man.  Throughout the month since Mr Slater went missing, his family have refused to give up hope.  On Saturday, a statement of an official fundraising page, which has raised more than £50,000 towards search efforts, described him as a ""normal, hardworking young lad from Lancashire who is very loved by all who know him"".  ""Although we don't have any answers to his disappearance we obviously have to remain positive,"" his friend Lucy Mae Law posted on behalf of his family. Lancashire Police, which had previously had its offer to help with the search turned down by the Tenerife police, said in a statement that it ""had today been notified by the Guardia Civil that they have found the body of a man and that the indications are that this is Jay Slater"".  The statement added: ""While at this stage no formal identification has been carried out our thoughts are very much with Jay’s family at this time, and we continue to offer them our support."" Search teams have had to contend with difficult terrain throughout their search for Mr Slater. Tenerife is a volcanic island in the Atlantic ocean archipelago of the Canary Islands, and the area in which Mr Slater was last seen is full of steep cliffs and gorges. The land is arid and dotted with cacti.  In his last phone call to his friend Ms Law shortly before his phone battery died, Mr Slater is said to have told her that he was bleeding and needed water.  Another friend of Mr Slater, Brad Hargreaves, later said in a television interview that Mr Slater had video called him just before the call to Ms Law, and had indicated he had slipped off the road he was walking.  Within days of Mr Slater's disappearance, social media was awash with theories about what had happened to him, including suggestions of foul play. The Guardia Civil has never suggested they believed any harm had come to Mr Slater by any other person or people.  But that did not do anything to quell the rampant speculation. His family and friends said they had found themselves the victims of online trolls.  Rachel Hargreaves, the mother of Mr Slater's friend Bradley Hargreaves, told the BBC she had received a friend request from a fake account using her late mother's photo as its profile picture.  She said ""things don't normally get to me"", but that had affected her.  ""We’re living the worst nightmare you can live and this does not help,"" she said.  Mr Slater's mother also made reference to the upset caused by the online frenzy around the case.  ""There is a lot of negativity unfortunately and this is adding to the heartbreak of the unknown"", she said in an update on the GoFundMe page, set up to help pay for the search.

420,Africa’s richest man says he doesn’t own a home outside Nigeria,"Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has shocked many Nigerians after saying he doesn't own a house outside the country. Mr Dangote said he had two houses - in his home town of Kano, and Lagos - and lived in a rented apartment whenever he visits the capital, Abuja. He was listed by Forbes magazine in January as Africa's richest man for the 13th year in a row despite the country's economic difficulties. His fortune rose by $400m over the last year, giving him a net worth of $13.9bn (£10.7bn), Forbes said at the time. The 66-year-old businessman made his fortune in cement and sugar - and last year opened an oil refinery in Nigeria's economic hub, Lagos. The industrialist made the disclosure while speaking to journalists at the Dangote Petroleum Refinery on Sunday. His comments surprised many in a country where the rich elite have a reputation for their opulent lifestyles. Many wealthy Nigerians own houses in London, Dubai and Atlanta. His comments have elicited a wide reaction on social media, with some saying it is a wise business decision as it is cheaper to pay rent than to buy a house. For Mr Dangote, the reason is simply because he wants to see Nigeria grow. “The reason I don’t have a London or America house is solely because I wanted to focus on industrialization in Nigeria,"" he said. ""I am very passionate about the Nigeria dream and apart from my Lagos house, I have another one in my home state, Kano, and a rented one in Abuja. “If I have houses all over, in America and co, I would not be able to concentrate and build something for my people.” Mr Dangote is known to own an opulent residence in Lagos’ popular Banana Island, where many high-profile Nigerians also have mansions. His house in his home state of Kano is a modest one and was used to received his guests following the death of his brother Sani Dangote in 2021. Public affairs analyst Sani Bala said Mr Dangote was setting a very good example. “Nigerians need to be re-oriented to understand owning several mansions is not an achievement when the money would be needed elsewhere. “Dangote said he sold his house in London in 1996 and I am sure monies realised from the sale was put back in his business - that is the way to go.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

418,Dozens of Indian workers freed from 'slavery' in Italy,"Dozens of Indian farm labourers have been freed from slave-like working conditions in northern Italy, police have said. The 33 workers were lured to Italy on the promise of jobs and a better future by two fellow Indian nationals, police say. But instead, they were allegedly forced to work more than 10 hours a day, seven days a week for a tiny wage which was used to pay off debts to the alleged gangmasters. The two men - who were found with approximately $545,300 (£420,000) - have been arrested. The exploitation of farmhands – both Italian and migrant - in Italy is a well-known issue. Thousands of people work in fields, vineyards and greenhouses dotted across the country, often without contracts and in highly dangerous conditions. Just last month, an Indian fruit picker died after his arm was severed in a work accident. The man had allegedly been left on the side of the road following the accident, which also left his legs crushed. His employer is now under investigation for criminal negligence and manslaughter. The 33 men rescued by police in the Province of Verona had paid  €17,000 ($18,554, £14,293) or 1.5m rupees each in return for seasonal work permits and jobs, according to a police statement sent to the BBC. To raise the funds, police said, some pawned their family assets, while others borrowed the money from their employers. But they were only paid €4 per hour for their 10 to 12-hour days, with that sum settling any debt owed. Their passports were also confiscated as soon as they arrived in Italy and they were banned from leaving their ""dilapidated"" apartments. ""Every morning, the workers piled into vehicles covered in tarpaulin where they hid among boxes of vegetables until they reached the Verona countryside for work,"" the police statement said. Searches of their apartments showed the workers were ""forced to live in precarious and degrading conditions"" and ""in total violation of health and hygiene regulations"", it added. The rescued workers have received their passports back and are being helped by social services and a migration organisation to relocate to safer housing and working conditions. The two alleged gangmasters are now facing charges related to exploitation and slavery, police told Reuters news agency. Undocumented labourers across Italy are often subject to a system known as “caporalato” – a gangmaster system which sees middlemen illegally hiring labourers who are then forced to work for very low salaries. Even workers with regular papers are often paid well below the legal wage. Almost a quarter of the agricultural workforce in Italy in 2018 was employed under this method, according to a study by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. The practice also affects workers in the service industry and building sectors. It was outlawed in Italy in 2016 after an Italian woman died of a heart attack after working 12-hour shifts picking and sorting grapes, for which she was paid €27 a day.",2024-07-15 23:10:40,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84jmkg0k40o,"Meryl Sebastian,",2024-07-15 12:10:40,

416,Whales were healthy before Orkney stranding - expert,"A pod of 77 pilot whales that died after washing ashore in Orkney were healthy before they became stranded, according to initial findings. The animals were found on the island of Sanday on Thursday following what could be the largest mass stranding in nearly 100 years. Cetacean specialists - whose expertise is in aquatic mammals - have been examining tissue samples to establish the cause of the stranding. Mariel ten Doeschate, from the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, told BBC Scotland News that thorough post-mortems had so far been carried out on about 30 whales. She said: ""Just about everyone in the UK who is involved with whale strandings is here on Sanday. ""We've been taking samples to determine the health status of the whales before the stranding and according to our initial preliminary findings, they all seem to have been healthy. ""So it's unlikely there was a sick leader who they were trying to stay with and protect."" Members of the public are being asked to stay away from the area. Experts arrived on the island on Friday and it is thought the full investigation could take three or four days.  ""We are working through a process of elimination to find the cause,"" said Ms ten Doeschate. ""But these strandings are rarely the cause of a single source, it’s usually a combination of factors. ""Some of the whales had fresh stomach content which suggests they were feeding nearby around the time they became stranded.  ""The beach they were stranded on is a very sandy beach which is often difficult for the whales to detect due to how their acoustics work."" Pilot whales are social creatures and live in a matriarch-style social structure, with the oldest female seen as having the authority in the pod. Ms ten Doeschate said the animals were stranded close together which is a behavioural stress response and means that something could have frightened them - like a sound or a predator - and made them cluster.  The investigators have taken ear samples from six key whales to look for acoustic trauma. The research associate said the investigation was a way of ensuring the whales had ""not died in vain"" as the findings could be used to help wild whales in the future. She said the team was also investigating if there were any killer whales nearby at the time. ""We need to consider whether they were pulled into going near the land because they were maybe pursuing prey, or were they pushed because they were avoiding something?"" she added. The pod included male whales, measuring up to seven metres (22ft) long, as well as females, calves and juveniles. The British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) established that 12 of the animals at Tresness Beach on the island of Sanday were still alive when they came out of the water. Emma Neave-Webb, from the BDMLR charity, said the animals were thought have been stranded ""for quite some time"". She said animals were very closely packed together with alive animals next to dead animals. The area was cut off by the high tide and the whales needed to be moved back into an upright position as quickly as possible if there was to be any chance of saving them. But the soft sand meant the whales fell back over when the rescuers attempted to right them. The decision was made to euthanise the animals after efforts to save them failed. Ms Neave-Webb said that removing the whales was a ""massive undertaking"". Orkney Islands Council confirmed discussions were taking place with community representatives on how best to dispose of the bodies, with the ""likely option"" being burial. The stranding is thought to be the largest UK stranding since 1927 when 126 out of more than 130 false killer whales died in the Dornoch Firth, in the Highlands. Last year an entire pod of 55 pilot whales died following a stranding on Lewis.",2024-07-15 23:10:40,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7240nex4ljo,"Katy Scott,",2024-07-14 23:10:40,
414,Defeat may be Southgate's last - but he'd leave England with head high,"Gareth Southgate has taken us on one heck of a journey over the past eight years, but I suspect Sunday’s defeat by Spain will be his last game as England manager. Right now Gareth will be hurting like hell after what happened in Berlin but my feeling is that, when the dust settles on the final of Euro 2024, he will decide he’s had enough. It should be his decision to stay or go - and I think it will be - but it is a tiring job and he has been doing it for a long time. If he does leave, he should go with his head held high because England are in a completely different place now compared to where they were when he took over in 2016. England were at rock bottom after losing to Iceland and becoming a laughing stock that summer, followed by the embarrassment of Sam Allardyce’s exit after his short stint in charge. England lose to Spain in Euro 2024 final - reaction What now for England, Southgate & Kane after same old pain? 'England have the best squad, but not the best team' Gareth came in and put a smile on everyone’s faces - bringing the squad together, getting us to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 and then the final of the European Championship in 2021, with a lesser squad than he had this time. He put the team in a much better position mentally and the spirit he nurtured helped us get to the final again. For achieving all of those things he deserves a huge amount of respect and gratitude, but it’s just unfortunate that - for all his excellent work - Gareth just wasn’t quite able to get the best out of this team in Germany, and that was the difference between us reaching another final and winning one. My guess is – and it is only a guess – he may now say to someone else that it is their turn to try to get England over the line. If he does, then he has put the team in an excellent position for someone to take the team forward, to take that next step and win a major tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 England Spain were the superior side, but I think we were all expecting more from England in Berlin. For starters, Spain dominated possession, which they had not done in a lot of their games over the past few weeks. They play in a slightly different way now to the way they did when they had success in the past, but we sort of stood off them and allowed them to play at their own pace. You can’t do that against a team with as many quality players as they have got, because they can hurt you. England found that out the hard way. We got away with it for a while in the second half because Jordan Pickford made a great save when they were 1-0 up and they missed a couple of really good chances to put the game out of sight. Then we got the changes from Gareth and an equaliser from one of the players who came on, and all of a sudden you are thinking hang on, here we go again. Another comeback… maybe, just maybe, another win. We had come from a goal down to get through each knockout round on our way to the final, and being a team of great moments rather than a great team had got us this far. It was not enough to derail Spain, however. They had deserved to win all six of their previous games at this tournament, and they deserved to win this one too. They sliced right through the middle of us to score their winner and they dominated us the way they have dominated the competition. Yes, we came close to nicking a second goal from a set-piece right at the end but, if we are being honest, we all know that Spain played the game the way that most people wanted England to play it, which is on the front foot. This video can not be played 'It hurts' - Shearer No-one can ever question this England side’s attitude or commitment – like their togetherness, they have shown they have all of that in abundance – but they have not been able to play the right kind of football for most of this tournament. We have seen glimpses of it, like in the first 30 minutes of the opening game against Serbia, or a similar spell in the first half of the semi-final against the Netherlands, but we have not really seen enough in any of the seven games we have played in Germany. This video can not be played 'We have to hold our hands up' - Southgate says Spain were deserved winners Our best spells in attack have come when we have reacted to something going wrong – in all four knockout games we have gone behind, which tells its own story. Then, all of a sudden, we got slightly better when, in an ideal world, we would not have had to wait. Finding a way to win is an impressive trait for any team to have, but it was not enough to take us to the trophy and of course that hurts. We had a better squad than three years ago and, because of the expectation Gareth’s success has put on this England team, we expect them to win now. If we are going to do that we are going to have to back our ability, the way Spain did against us when the game was in the balance. Gareth made some more big calls and he got them right but, this time, Spain made decisive changes too. When you are in a final, you have got to get over the line and they were the ones who did that. Unfortunately, we were not quite good enough to get the ending we all wanted this time.

413,Irish PM condemns 'reprehensible' Dublin violence,"Fifteen people have appeared at a special court sitting in Dublin following violence during  a protest at a site which had been earmarked for asylum seekers. Some protestors set pallets and construction machinery alight at the former Crown Paints factory in Coolock in north Dublin, resulting in a large fire. It is understood work was due to begin on the Malahide Road site later in the week. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris described the disturbances as ""reprehensible"". The 15 people who appeared at Dublin District Court on Monday evening were charged with public order offences, including failure to comply with the orders of a garda (police officer) and with threatening or abusive behaviour. All 15 were released on conditional bail, provided they stay away from the scene of the disorder They are all due to appear in court again on 18 September. Another four people who were arrested are due to appear in court on Tuesday morning. More than 200 gardaí were deployed to the incident. Three Garda cars were been damaged, one of which was set on fire, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported. It said pepper spray was used by police as a security guard and a number of gardaí were injured during clashes with protesters. Petrol bombs and fireworks were thrown, mattresses were set on fire damaging a JCB and fires were lit on the roads during the disturbances.  Gardaí described the disturbances as a public order incident and the road was closed for a period. They said officers were ""subjected to both verbal and physical abuse throughout the day, which escalated into rocks, fireworks and other objects being launched towards them"". ""A number of fires were lit and official Garda vehicles seriously damaged,"" a spokesperson said. ""As the situation intensified, members of An Garda Síochána used force to defend themselves as part of an escalated response to the situation."" Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said: it had been a difficult day for his officers and condemned what happened. ""We have seen attacks on gardaí, criminal damage and offences of serious public disorder,"" he said. ""All of these will be fully investigated. We have 15 people charged and we will have further charges overnight.""  The Irish justice minister said she was ""appalled at the criminal behaviour that took place in Coolock"". Helen McEntee said anybody involved would face ""the full rigours of the law"". Dublin city councillor Mícheál Mac Donncha described the incident as ""deplorable"" and that ""violence, intimidation and arson should have no place in our communities"". ""The burning of vehicles and attempted burning of the building are violent criminal acts and must be strongly condemned,"" the Sinn Féin representative said. He said the Department of Integration had said the site was being developed to accommodate families seeking international protection. “Those responsible should desist immediately,"" he added. ""This is an effort to spread fear and hate in our communities and the vast majority of decent people want nothing to do with it.""",2024-07-15 23:10:40,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvww23nxo,Unknown,2024-07-15 22:13:40,
419,I stepped on a bomb in Afghanistan. Blind running saved my life,"Wali Noori was working as an interpreter for the British Army in Afghanistan in 2009 when he stepped on an explosive device.  The blast left him completely blind at the age of 20.   Growing up, he loved running in the mountains of Kabul but Wali thought he would never be able to run again.  Here, in his own words, he explains how moving to the UK changed his life and his determination to never give in. Growing up in Kabul I was a very good boxer and I used to run to keep myself fit. I finished my studies and wanted to go to university, but my family were very poor and I needed to support them. They were starving, my father was not able to work and I have five sisters and four brothers. So at the age of 18 I joined the British Army as a translator and cultural adviser. I had studied English at school and I was good at it. My job was to help the British Army, the Afghan forces and the local civilians communicate with each other and it was a very important job.  I was asked if I would go to Helmand Province, and I said yes, even though I knew I had to accept I might die. It was like hell. So many ambushes and people were dying every day but I wasn't scared. I had been there for two years when I stepped on an IED (improvised explosive device) while on patrol. I was thrown up into the air and came crashing back down. I thought I must be dying but it felt like a dream. My whole face was full of shrapnel and I lost all 28 of my teeth. I stopped breathing but put my hand down my throat and pulled out a piece of shrapnel. I could not see anything and I was helicoptered out, before spending two weeks in a coma in an army hospital in Kabul. The doctors did not expect me to survive. When I woke up, I could not speak and I had to write my name down for them, so they could call my friend who told my family what had happened. When my mum and dad came for the first time, it was very hard time for them. I managed to sit up so I would not look so poorly and I tried to smile for them, but I still could not speak. I was transferred to Bagram Hospital and airbase, where the Americans treated my facial wounds and fractures. I was breathing through a tube from my neck. I was there for a month before I went to hospitals in both India and Pakistan to see if they could save my sight, but it was not possible. It was not easy and I had some very dark days. I used to love running but I thought my running days were over. I was a single man and I ended up living back with my family in Afghanistan. I did not know how I would get through the rest of my life and I thought no one would want to marry me. But in 2012, I had an arranged marriage. From that day on my wife has been my biggest supporter. She threw away my white cane and she said ""I am your stick"". She is very kind and whenever I get sad she says ""come on, I am here"". We have three beautiful children and we are so lucky. I could not work while living in Afghanistan, even though I wanted to. The British Army gave me one year's salary but I was struggling and the country is not set up very well for disabled people. In 2014, I was told by the British Government that I was eligible to come to the UK with my family. It took two years to sort out but since we moved to Colchester, we have never looked back. I really like it here. It is a nice place and I have made some lovely friends, especially at my running club, the Colchester Harriers. And we are safe. I realised I could start running again, because they have guide runners, and this has given me back my freedom and my mental health. I get terrible headaches due to my injuries but I go out running and my headache is forgotten. I waited for five years to get selected for the Invictus Games and I was so proud to represent the UK last September. I won four gold medals, in the 100m, 200m, 400m and 1500m. I met Prince Harry and Meghan and they were so warm and friendly. Harry shook my hand, I didn't know who he was. I said ""who is this?"" and he said ""I'm Prince Harry"" and we laughed and chatted. It was an incredible moment in my life. I have now won 21 medals for running and three for swimming. I always want to move forwards in my life and I never look back. I am always trying to improve and I make sure I never give up.  My dream is to one day compete at the Paralympic Games. I qualified for it in terms of how quick I am, and meet the criteria, but I missed the deadline to apply this time. But I will get there one day. I would also like to complete the six major marathons, having done London in 2019. I have just written a book about my life and it will be published on 12 September, which is 15 years to the day I went blind. I go into schools and colleges and different groups like army veterans to share my story and I recently spoke to some veterans who were injured in Ukraine. When I get money for these speeches I send it back to Afghanistan to help the widows and orphans there. I will never regret signing up to work for the British Army and what happened to me. Life was very tough for me before that but life is going well for me now. I will never surrender to my blindness. I want to keep inspiring people and show that disability does not have to stop you from achieving great things. As told to Charlie Jones Follow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

426,'Woods will try but those he inspired will triumph at Troon',"Tiger Woods is playing his third Open since finishing joint sixth in 2018, he missed the cut in the other two Venue: Royal Troon Dates: Thu 18-Sun 21 July Coverage: Live radio and text commentary on BBC Sport website, with video clips each day. Daily highlights programme on BBC Two from 20:00 BST. Click for full details. As Tiger Woods climbed the steep slope from the seventh green it was a great, iconic figure arriving on one of golf’s most famous stages - the teeing ground for the hole they call the 'Postage Stamp'. His gait has an uneasiness because his right foot needed reconstruction after nearly losing his leg in a car crash and there is a certain stiffness to his movement because his back has long since been surgically fused. But he still carries an aura. Even when it is just him and his caddie Lance Bennett on a Sunday recce before a major week, there is a presence about Tiger. The fans know it and he commands the biggest gallery as he merely shakes off the effects of the overnight flight from Florida to the South Ayrshire coast where he  plays the 152nd Open at Royal Troon this week. It will be his 23rd Open and 95th major. He will insist he can contend even though compelling evidence suggests otherwise and crowds will continue to flock to follow the 48-year-old. McIlroy wants to 'get putter to cooperate' at Open 'The one I wanted' - MacIntyre's dramatic Scottish Open win All you need to know about The Open 2024 There is still magic in the hands that have held 15 major trophies. From the elevated teeing ground on Troon’s renowned eighth hole, an area surrounded by a grandstand running the length of The Open’s shortest hole, he swings in carefree fashion. It is a 123-yard flick with a wedge that tracks all the way, lands, skips and stops three feet from the pin. Moments later he nonchalantly knocks in the birdie putt. This was the hole where outside hopes had once floundered with a final-round triple-bogey six. That was in 1997 when he was a Masters sensation and playing his first Open as a professional. He returns having won three Opens but wondering if this will be his last Championship, with the likes of Colin Montgomerie suggesting it should be because he is past it. At the ninth he loses a ball in the right rough. In places the grasses are punishingly thick for this Open, but as fearsome as it looks, the rough has browned off, it is more brittle than juicy and therefore potentially playable. A few holes ahead another ball search begins down the left of the par-five 16th.  It is the current Masters champion Scottie Scheffler along with US compatriot and friend Sam Burns who are having a cursory look for an errant drive. These two American Ryder Cup players have also attracted a decent gallery and those watching are looking at potential challengers this week - especially Scheffler, who has already won six tournaments this year. The Dallas-based star owns the dominant space in world golf that Woods used to occupy. But he was discomfited by the capricious bounces of last month’s US Open at Pinehurst, a rare event where he failed to trouble the leaderboard operatives. Links golf can be similarly unpredictable, especially if the wind blows as forecast for Thursday’s start. Scheffler only just made the cut at Hoylake last year and finished outside the top 20 in what was only his third Open. Rory McIlroy is the player closest to Scheffler in the world rankings and comes here having squandered a glorious chance to end a barren run at the majors that will stretch beyond a decade if he does not win this week. At Pinehurst the four-time major champion led by two with five holes to play, but bogeyed three of the last four and Bryson DeChambeau snatched his second US Open crown. McIlroy has the game but his nerve will be tested like never before if he contends this week. The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland talks of “resilience” and might have won last week’s Scottish Open but for a putting stroke and green reading that have yet to accurately adjust to links greens. Instead, the home favourite Bob MacIntyre rumbustiously celebrated the biggest win of his career, profiting from a fortunate drop on the 16th and inspired play down the rest of the stretch to pip Adam Scott. MacIntyre proved he has what it takes when he wants it most - the commodity that has eluded McIlroy for far too long. Could the Scot go back-to-back? He has climbed to 16th in the world rankings and is arguably now Britain’s biggest hope this week. But Tommy Fleetwood is another to consider in that bracket. The runner-up to Shane Lowry in 2019 at Royal Portrush has the ball-striking attributes for a course lengthened by nearly 200 yards from the last time the Open was here in 2016. Fleetwood was grinding last week on the practice putting green at the Renaissance Club during the Scottish Open and if that work pays dividends, the Englishman might make his major breakthrough. He has been top-10 in four of the past six championships. In recent weeks, Lowry has been trending nicely and, on a course where chipping and wedge play will be well tested, could contend for a second Claret Jug. The Irishman finished joint sixth behind Xander Schauffele at May’s US PGA Championship. Schauffele, a former Scottish Open winner, has links credentials and is no longer the best player in the world without a major title. He and DeChambeau are the two most recent major winners and, therefore, significant threats this week. The same might be said of Collin Morikawa, the champion on debut in 2021 at Royal St George’s, and a regular on major leaderboards this year. The 27-year-old Californian was third at the Masters and fourth at the PGA. He was also in the mix at the US Open before familiar final day fade struck again to leave him 14th. And on Sunday he briefly flickered at the Scottish Open before finishing joint fourth alongside McIlroy. His aim must be to sustain his 54-hole form for the full distance. Speaking of 54 holes, DeChambeau heads the challenge from the breakaway LIV circuit who will be seeking to show that a week amid the cork trees of Valderrama  in southern Spain is a decent way to warm up for the final major of the year. If it is, watch out for an in form Tyrrell Hatton who was third behind Sergio Garcia last Sunday. Garcia did not qualify for the Open. Cameron Smith, the 2022 champion, finished strongly to come sixth in the latest LIV event, while former world number one Jon Rahm was 10th and remains winless since his 2023 Masters triumph. Men’s professional golf remains split between the establishment and the LIV Tour.  Woods priority these days is trying to negotiate the game’s future, the latest addition to his legacy. In terms of play, he will try his best in the coming championship, but the reality is that we will be watching the big-hitting generation he inspired; Scheffler, McIlroy, DeChambeau, Schauffele, Fleetwood, MacIntyre and co. They will be the ones trying to create golf’s newest chapter by doing battle for the oldest and most prestigious trophy in the game.",2024-07-15 23:10:41,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cgrl170zz31o,Iain Carter at Royal Troon,2024-07-15 23:10:41,
427,Van Gerwen beats Littler in World Matchplay first round,"Michael van Gerwen is yet to win a ranking title in 2024 Three-time winner Michael van Gerwen beat teenager Luke Littler 10-6 in the opening round of the World Matchplay in Blackpool. Van Gerwen, who has been world champion three times, has been below his best in 2024 but showed glimpses of brilliance to brush aside Littler. Matchplay debutant Littler, who has won a ranking event every month in 2024, struggled for fluency at times and was casual at the oche on a number of occasions.  The pair exchanged breaks early on, but Van Gerwen led 3-2 and 6-4 at the intervals before closing out the win. The Dutchman finished with a 101.93 average and was 43.5% on checkouts as he set up a second-round tie against Joe Cullen. ""This means a lot to me because I've been going through a rough time,"" Van Gerwen, who has won six of his 10 matches against Littler, told Sky Sports. ""To actually do something good and be rewarded for all your hard work is always nice."" Recap: Van Gerwen beats Littler in opening round of World Matchplay Elsewhere, number three seed Michael Smith beat Gary Anderson 10-5 to progress.  Smith, world champion in 2023, suffered a double early break but then won seven legs on the spin to take control. The Winter Gardens crowd were singing ""Scotland get battered everywhere they go"" to Anderson during Smith's turnaround, prompting the Scot to gesture '2-1', referencing England's defeat by Spain in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday.  Chris Dobey awaits Smith in the second round after he beat Ritchie Edhouse 10-7. The game was nip and tuck, with Dobey twice hitting double-double checkouts, until he won three legs on the spin to seal the win.  Somerset's Ryan Searle recovered from going 2-0 down to beat Australia's Damon Heta 10-4 and set up a second-round game against 2018 world champion Rob Cross.  World champion Luke Humphries and defending champion Nathan Aspinall progressed on Saturday with a 10-4 win over Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko and 10-8 victory over Luke Woodhouse respectively.  Former champion Peter Wright was knocked out on Sunday, though, alongside seventh seed Dave Chisnall.  Wright lost 10-5 to Andrew Gilding, while Chisnall was thrashed 10-2 by Poland's Krzysztof Ratajski. The tournament concludes on Sunday, with the final at 20:00 BST.

444,"Who is Usha Vance, lawyer and wife of Trump's VP pick?","As JD Vance walked on to the RNC convention floor to accept the party’s vice-presidential nomination on Monday, speakers lined up to lavish praise on his impeccable credentials. But the Ohio senator and running mate of Republican White House candidate Donald Trump has previously said he feels “humbled” by the stellar CV of his wife, Usha Vance. While she does not seek out the political spotlight, Mrs Vance, 38, wields considerable influence over her husband’s career, he has said. In an interview on Fox News last month, she said: ""I believe in JD, and I really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life."" The two met as students at Yale Law School in 2013, when they joined a discussion group on “social decline in white America”, according to the New York Times. The content influenced Mr Vance's best-selling 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class Rust Belt, which became a 2020 movie directed by Ron Howard. Mr Vance, 39, has said he considered her his “Yale spirit guide” when they were classmates at the elite university. Mrs Vance previously graduated with a BA in history from Yale University and was also a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she came away with an MPhil in early modern history, according to her LinkedIn profile. The couple wed in 2014 and have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel. Mrs Vance - née Chilukuri, the child of Indian immigrants - was born and raised in the suburbs of San Diego, California. Her husband regularly rails about ""woke"" ideas he says are pushed by Democrats, but his wife was formerly a registered Democrat and is now a corporate litigator at a San Francisco law firm which proudly touts its reputation for being “radically progressive”. Mrs Vance once clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, on the District of Columbia court of appeals. Then she clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Both men are part of the highest court's conservative majority. “Usha definitely brings me back to Earth a little bit,” Mr Vance told the Megyn Kelly Show podcast in 2020. “And if I maybe get a little bit too cocky or a little too proud I just remind myself that she is way more accomplished than I am.” “People don’t realise just how brilliant she is,” he added, saying she is able to digest a 1,000-page book in only a few hours. She is the ""powerful female voice on his left shoulder”, giving him guidance, he said. As Mr Vance gears up for what is certain to be a gruelling campaign for the White House, he may need her counsel more than ever before.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c897483zpyeo,"Jude Sheerin,",2024-07-16 02:09:37,
443,Vance choice heightens European fears over Trump presidency,"European politicians and diplomats had already prepared for changes to their relationship with the US in the event of a second Donald Trump presidency. Now that the Republican candidate has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate, those differences appear even more stark on prospects for the war in Ukraine, security and trade. A vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, Mr Vance told this year’s Munich Security Conference that Europe should wake up to the US having to “pivot” its focus to East Asia.  ""The American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,"" he said. Nils Schmid, a senior MP in German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s party, told the BBC that he was confident a Republican presidency would continue to stay within Nato, even if JD Vance came across as ""more isolationist"" and Donald Trump remained ""unpredictable"". However, he warned of a new round of ""trade wars"" with the US under a second Trump presidency. An EU diplomat said that after four years of Donald Trump no-one was naïve: ""We understand what it means if Trump comes back as a second-term president, regardless of his running mate."" Portraying the EU as a sailing boat preparing for a storm the diplomat, who preferred not to be named, added that whatever they might be able to tie down, it was always going to be rough. The US is Ukraine's biggest ally, and President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week: ""I'm not afraid about him becoming president, we will work together."" He also said that he believed most of the Republican party supported Ukraine and its people. Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump also have a common friend in Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister, who has consistently championed continued aid for Ukraine and recently met the former president at the Republican National Convention. Following the meeting, Mr Johnson posted on X that he had “no doubt that [Mr Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy”. But even if that sentiment is true, it might not apply to Mr Vance, who, days before the full-scale invasion, told a podcast he “doesn’t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other”. He also played a key role in delaying a $60bn military aid package from Washington. ""We need to try and convince him otherwise,"" says Yevhen Mahda, the Executive Director of the Institute of World Policy think tank in Kyiv. ""A fact we can use is that he fought in Iraq, therefore he should be invited to Ukraine so he can see with his own eyes what is happening and how American money is spent."" The question for Kyiv will be to what extent he can influence the decisions of his new boss. Yevhen Mahda agrees that Trump’s unpredictability could be a problem for Kyiv in the run-up to the US presidential election. The biggest supporter of the Trump-Vance ticket in the European Union is Hungary’s Viktor Orban who returned recently from a visit to see the Republican candidate, after visiting Mr Zelensky and President Putin, with whom he maintains close ties. In a letter to EU leaders, Mr Orban said a victorious Donald Trump would not even wait to be inaugurated as president before quickly demanding peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. ""He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,"" the letter states. Mr Zelensky has himself said this week that Russia should attend a peace summit possibly next November, and he has promised a “fully ready plan”. But he made clear he had not come under Western pressure to do so. Viktor Orban's recent ""peace missions"" to Moscow and Beijing have sparked accusations that he’s abusing his country’s six-month rotating presidency of the European Council. European Commission officials have been told not to attend meetings in Hungary because of Mr Orban’s actions. During the Trump presidency, the US imposed tariffs on EU-produced steel and aluminium. Although they were paused under Joe Biden’s administration, Trump has since floated a 10% tariff on all overseas imports should he get back into the White House. The prospect of renewed economic confrontation with the US will be seen as a bad, even a disastrous, outcome in most European capitals. ""The only thing we know for sure is there will be punitive tariffs levelled on the European Union so we have to prepare for another round of trade wars,"" said Nils Schmid, the Social Democrats’ foreign policy lead in the Bundestag. JD Vance singled out Berlin for criticism of its military preparedness earlier this year. While he didn’t mean to ""beat up"" on Germany, he said the industrial base underpinning its arms production was  insufficient. This will all pile further pressure on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, to ""step up"" as a principle player in underwriting European security. After his much-lauded ""zeitenwende"" (turning point) speech in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Olaf Scholz was often accused of hesitancy on supplying weapons to Kyiv. But his allies are always keen to point out that Germany is second only to the US in terms of military aid to Kyiv while it has – for the first time since the end of the Cold War – met the 2% GDP defence spending target, albeit via short-term budgeting. ""I think we are on the right track,"" said Mr Schmid. ""We have to build back an army that was neglected for 15 to 20 years."" But observers are far from convinced that behind-the-scenes European preparations are either serious or sufficient. There are few leaders with the political clout or inclination to champion the future security architecture of an unwieldy European continent. Chancellor Scholz has an understated style and clear resistance to taking a lead on bolder foreign policy positions – and faces a very real prospect of being voted out of office next year. French President Emmanuel Macron has been left a severely weakened figure after calling parliamentary elections that have left his country in a state of political paralysis. Polish President Andrzej Duda warned on Tuesday that if Ukraine loses its struggle against Russia “then Russia’s potential war with the West will be extremely imminent”. ""This voracious Russian monster will want to attack on and on.""",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727zvgvv8ko,"Jess Parker & James Waterhouse,",2024-07-16 20:09:37,
442,Mystery surrounds deaths at Grand Hyatt hotel in Bangkok,"Six people have been found dead in a luxury hotel suite in Thailand's capital, Bangkok. Confusion and mystery has surrounded the grim discovery, with local media initially suggesting there had been a shooting at the five-star Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok, but police later dismissed these reports and said there was no evidence of gunfire.  Instead, authorities are investigating whether the victims died of poisoning. The deceased - three men and three women - were all Vietnamese nationals, and some had dual American citizenship, Thailand's prime minister said. Srettha Thavisin, who visited the scene, added that investigators suspect the victims had been dead for 24 hours by the time they were found and that post mortem examinations would be carried out. He added that police ""needed to find out the motives"", and that the deaths were the result of a ""killing"", not a suicide.  Seven people were booked to stay at the hotel, but only five checked in and one person is currently unaccounted for, Metropolitan police chief Lt Gen Thiti Saengswang said.  One of the victims found in the room did not match the hotel's records. He added that suspicious substances and the DNA of the victims were detected in drinks ordered to the suite just before 14:00 local time on Monday.  The food the victims ordered was not touched.  The guests had been scheduled to check out on Monday.  They went from the hotel's seventh floor to the fifth, where their bodies were found by housekeepers in the suite's living room and bedroom. Investigators say there is no evidence of a fight or a robbery, and the only wound found on one of the bodies was likely caused by a collapse. In the bathroom, tea, energy drinks and honey were found, all in open containers, the police chief said. It also appears that two of the victims tried to get to the hotel suite's door, which was locked from the inside, but did not manage to reach it in time.  The victims' luggage will now be searched as part of the investigation. A spokesperson for the US State Department said they were ""closely monitoring the situation"", and expressed their condolences to the families of the victims.  Matthew Miller added that Washington was ""ready to provide assistance"" to them.  The Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok is in a popular tourist spot. Some of the victims were visiting Thailand for the first time, while others had been before, a police officer who wished to remain anonymous said.  The prime minister said that he did not want this incident to affect Thailand's image or have an impact on tourism - which is a key pillar of the Thai economy, but which has not fully recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.  The country has just expanded its visa-free entry scheme to 93 countries and territories in an effort to entice tourists back.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g3prgzzjpo,"Jamie Whitehead,",2024-07-16 18:09:37,
441,"Gaza man with Down's syndrome attacked by IDF dog and left to die, mother tells BBC","Warning: Readers may find some of the details below distressing. There was always his family. When he was bullied at school, and beaten, they were there to embrace him when he came home. And when the war started and he was terrorised by the sound of bombs falling, someone always said things were going to be ok.  Muhammed was heavy and found movement difficult. He spent his days sitting in an armchair. If he needed anything, there was a niece or nephew to help. Muhammed Bhar was 24 and had Down’s syndrome and autism. His mother, Nabila Bhar, 70, told the BBC:  “He didn’t know how to eat, drink, or change his clothes. I’m the one who changed his nappies. I’m the one who fed him. He didn’t know how to do anything by himself.” On 27 June the war came back to the Bhar family’s neighbourhood and Muhammed’s small world shrank further. Along with other residents of Shejaiya, east of Gaza City centre, the Bhars were given orders to evacuate by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).   The IDF was advancing into Shejaiya in pursuit of Hamas fighters fighting from tunnels and houses. But the Bhars were tired of moving. In a weary tone, Nabila, who is a widow, reeled off the names of relatives’ homes where they’d sought shelter. “We evacuated around 15 times. We would go to Jibreel's place, but then there would be bombing at Jibreel's place. We would go to Haydar Square, but then there would be bombing at Haydar Square. We would go to Rimal, but then there would be bombing at Rimal. We would go to Shawa Square, but there would be bombing at Shawa Square.” The fighting intensified in the streets around them. They would hide in different parts of the house, often in the bathroom when shooting became especially intense.  “We were under siege for seven days. The tanks and soldiers were all around the house… Muhammed was staying on his sofa…and he didn’t like sitting anywhere except for there,” says Nabila. For Muhammed war meant loud, violent sounds, the air vibrating with the concussion from shells exploding nearby. None of this could be explained to him. “He would panic and say, ‘I'm scared, scared’,” Nabila remembers.  “He would say, ‘Hey, hey’, thinking that someone wanted to hit him. He was always scared, fearful. We would come around him, comfort him. He didn't understand much. His autism made it very difficult.” On 3 July, according to the family, the IDF raided their home on Nazaz Street. Nabila says there were several dozen soldiers with a combat dog - animals used to find Hamas fighters, and check for booby traps and explosives.  At first she heard them “breaking in and smashing everything” before the soldiers and dog arrived in the room. Referring to Muhammed, she says: “I told them, ‘He’s disabled, disabled. Have mercy on him, he’s disabled. Keep the dog away from him.'” Nabila saw the animal attack Muhammed.  “The dog attacked him, biting his chest and then his hand. Muhammed didn’t speak, only muttering ‘No, no, no.’ The dog bit his arm and the blood was shed. I wanted to get to him but I couldn’t. No-one could get to him, and he was patting the dog’s head saying, ‘enough my dear enough.’ In the end, he relaxed his hand, and the dog started tearing at him while he was bleeding.” Around this point, says Nabila, the soldiers took the young man into another room, and away from the dog. They tried to treat his wounds.  A terrified Muhammed, who had always depended on his family for help, was now in the care of combat soldiers, who had come from streets where they’d been fighting close quarter battles with Hamas. “They took him away, put him in a separate room, and locked the door. We wanted to see what happened to him. We wanted to see Muhammed, to see what had become of him,"" says Nabila.  ""They told us to be quiet and aimed their guns at us. They put us in a room by ourselves, and Muhammed was alone in another room. They said, ‘We will bring a military doctor to treat him.’” At one point, according to Nabila, a military doctor arrived and went into the room where Muhammed was lying. Muhammed’s niece, Janna Bhar, 11, described how the family pleaded with soldiers to help him. “We told them Muhammed was not well, but they kept saying he was fine.” After several hours, it is not clear how many, the family was ordered at gunpoint to leave, leaving Muhammed behind with the soldiers. There were pleas and cries. Two of his brothers were arrested by the army. They have still not been released. The rest of the family found shelter in a bombed out building. They returned a week later to a sight that haunts Muhammed’s brother Jibreel. He produces his mobile phone and shows our cameraman a video of the scene. Muhammed’s body is lying on the floor. There is blood around him, and a tourniquet on his arm. This was most probably used to stop heavy bleeding from his upper arm. Jibreel points to gauze used to bandage a wound, and remarks on the blood that clotted after the tourniquet was applied. “They were trying to stop the bleeding. Then they left him without stitches or care. Just these basic first aid measures. Of course, as you can see, Muhammed was dead for a period of time already because he was abandoned. We thought he wasn't at home. But it turned out he had been bleeding and left alone at home all this time. Of course, the army left him.” It is not clear what exact injury caused Muhammed’s death. Nor what happened to him in the time his family last saw him, and when his brother returned and filmed the dead young man on the floor. He was buried shortly after the family found him, in an alley between houses because it was too dangerous to take the corpse to the mortuary, or a graveyard.  There was no post-mortem and no certificate of death. The family is demanding an investigation but with fighting still going on, and so many dead, it is hard to be hopeful that will happen any time soon. In response to queries from the BBC the IDF said they were checking on the report. Nabila is left with an image of her dead child that refuses to go away. “This scene I will never forget… I constantly see the dog tearing at him and his hand, and the blood pouring from his hand… It is always in front of my eyes, never leaving me for a moment. We couldn't save him, neither from them nor from the dog.” With additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen and Alice Doyard.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9drj14e0lo,"Fergal Keane in Jerusalem,",2024-07-16 16:09:37,
440,UK deputy prime minister dismisses Vance 'Islamist UK' claim,"The deputy prime minister has dismissed comments by Donald Trump's running mate for US vice president that UK under Labour might be the first ""truly Islamist"" country with nuclear weapons. JD Vance, the Ohio senator chosen as Trump's vice presidential candidate on Monday night, made the comments while at the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC last week. The 39-year-old said he was ""beating up"" on the UK, and had discussed with a friend “what is the first truly Islamist country to get a nuclear weapon"", then joked ""maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan kind of counts, and then we sort of decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labour just took over"". The suggestion that Islamists are gaining in power in some European countries with Muslim minorities is common in some right-wing US political circles. Angela Rayner told ITV that Mr Vance had said ""quite a lot of fruity things in the past"" but said does not ""recognise"" his characterisation of the UK.  She added that she ""looked forward"" to meeting him and Donald Trump if they won the US election in November. His comments on the UK becoming an “Islamist country” were a direct criticism of Labour’s approach to immigration, and he also said that the Tories “have got to get a handle on this”.  Right-wing US political figures have often linked immigration to a rise in Islamism in a country and have regularly focused on the UK. During his speech to the National Conservatism conference Mr Vance made several further comments attacking immigration. He declared: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."" In the speech Mr Vance also said “I was in London last year, and it’s not doing so good” referring to both high house prices and high immigration, making a link between those. Speaking on ITV, Ms Rayner said: ""I'm very proud of the election success that Labour had recently. ""We won votes across all different communities, across the whole of the country, and we're interested in governing on behalf of Britain and also working with our international allies."" Mr Vance's comments were also criticised by Exchequer Secretary James Murray. Mr Murray told Sky News: ""I don't know what he was driving at in that comment, to be honest. I mean, in Britain, we're very proud of our diversity. ""I'm very proud that we have a new government, I'm very proud that our Labour government is committed to national security and economic growth. I'm very clear where we are.  ""I don't really know how that comment fits in."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy has spent recent months consciously seeking to forge strong relations with Donald Trump’s allies, among them Mr Vance. Mr Lammy met Mr Vance alongside several Trump allies during a goodwill mission to the US in May, describing him as his ""friend"". In a speech at the right-leaning Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Mr Lammy said Mr Vance was ""right to say we in Europe have a problem that we need to fix with higher defence expenditure"". He also said Trump has been “often misunderstood” when it comes to Nato, that he “gets the agenda that drives America First”, and that he would find “common cause” with a Trump administration. But Mr Vance's selection could pose a challenge for the new Labour government if Trump returns to the White House. Former US President Trump has opted for one of the most isolationist members of the Republican Party.  The former Trump-critic, now Trump-evangelist, opposes aiding Ukraine - while Sir Keir Starmer has committed to spending £3bn on aid for Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"". On Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson met Trump on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. ""We discussed Ukraine and I have no doubt that he will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy,"" Mr Johnson posted on X.  Mr Vance has also criticised Europe's overdependence on the US in foreign policy - potentially straining US-UK relations.  Regardless of Mr Vance’s recent intervention, Labour believes their diplomacy with Trump’s team is beginning to bear fruit.  Labour sources point to Sir Keir's conversation with the ex-president on Sunday in the aftermath of the assassination attempt - the first time the pair had spoken. Andrew Bowie, the shadow veterans minister, said he ""absolutely"" disagreed with the claim that Labour was creating an ""Islamist country"". He told Times Radio: ""I disagree with the Labour Party fundamentally on many issues, but I do not agree with that view, quite frankly.  ""I think it's actually quite offensive, frankly, to my colleagues in the Labour Party.""

437,Musk to move SpaceX and X HQ over gender-identity law,"Billionaire Elon Musk has said he will move the headquarters of two of his most high-profile companies, rocket firm SpaceX and social media platform X, out of California to Texas. He cited his opposition to a new Californian state law which bans schools from requiring staff to disclose information about a child's gender identity - including to parents.  ""This is the last straw,"" he wrote on social media.  The businessman had already moved Tesla's headquarters to Texas in 2021, a move he first threatened over Covid-era lockdowns.  Since then, he has become increasingly involved in US politics.  Over the weekend, he formally endorsed Donald Trump for president and on Tuesday, he confirmed a Wall Street Journal report he would be directing some $45m a month toward his campaign.  The issue of what schools should tell parents about their children's gender identities has become a major topic of debate in the US. LGBTQ advocates say students have a right to privacy, but others argue parents have a right to know what is happening with their children.  Mr Musk, who has a transgender daughter, has previously said he ""supports trans"" while expressing impatience with pronouns, which he has described as an ""aesthetic nightmare"".  Last year, he said he would lobby to criminalise transgender medical treatment that would lead to what he described as ""severe, irreversible changes to children below the age of consent"". ""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday, noting that he had previously expressed his opposition to the bill.  In explaining the decision to move X to Austin, Mr Musk criticised the state of affairs in San Francisco, saying he had ""had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building"". California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose name is among the ones that have been floated to possibly replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate for the upcoming election, did not immediately respond to the announcements. A spokesperson for the governor said after the bill was signed that it kept ""children safe while protecting the critical role of parents"".  ""It protects the child-parent relationship by preventing politicians and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters and attempting to control if, when, and how families have deeply personal conversations,"" Brandon Richards told the Associated Press.  States have historically competed aggressively to woo companies to establish headquarters, bringing with them high-paying corporate jobs.

436,Islamic State group claims deadly attack in Oman,"Six people, including a policeman, have been killed and 28 others injured in a rare shooting attack near a Shia Muslim mosque in Oman's capital, Muscat, police say. The three attackers were also killed by security forces during the incident in the al-Wadi al-Kabir area on Monday night, according to a statement. Police gave no details about the identities of the victims and gunmen, or the motive. But Pakistan said four Pakistanis were among those killed in a ""terrorist attack"" on the Imam Ali Mosque. India also said one  of its citizens was killed. The Sunni Muslim jihadist group Islamic State (IS) says three of its members were involved in the attack. Supporters of the group celebrated the shooting on social media networks.  IS has repeatedly targeted Shia ceremonies, processions and worshippers in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. But it has never before claimed an attack in Oman, where the Shia are a minority. Video showed a crowd running for cover inside the mosque's courtyard as gunshots were heard. Worshippers had gathered there on the eve of the Shia holy day of Ashura. The police statement expressed condolences to the victims' families and said an investigation into the circumstances of the incident was under way. It also emphasised ""the necessity of obtaining information from official sources and disregarding unreliable information"". Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the attack and that his heart went ""out to the families of the victims"". ""I have instructed the Pakistan embassy in Muscat to extend all possible assistance to the injured and visit the hospitals personally,"" he wrote on X. ""Pakistan stands in solidarity with the Sultanate of Oman and offers full assistance in the investigation."" Pakistan's embassy in Muscat named the four Pakistanis who were killed as Ghulam Abbas, Hasan Abbas, Sayyed Qaisar Abbas and Sulaiman Nawaz. It also said 30 Pakistanis were receiving hospital treatment. On Tuesday morning, Pakistani ambassador Imran Ali said in a video that he had visited some of those injured at three local hospitals and described their conditions as ""relatively safe"".  He also advised Pakistani residents of Oman to avoid al-Wadi al-Kabir and to co-operate with local authorities. Mr Ali later told AFP news agency that the attackers had initially opened fire from a building next to the mosque, where hundreds of people had gathered for a prayer service. The worshippers were held ""hostage"" by militants before ""they were later freed by Omani forces"", he said. India's embassy said it had been informed by the Omani foreign ministry that one Indian national had been killed and another injured, without identifying them. The shooting happened on the night of the ninth day of the Islamic month of Muharram, when Shia Muslims attend rituals on the eve of Ashura. Ashura is a major commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, in a battle in the seventh century. Some of the worshippers in the courtyard can be heard shouting “O God”, “O Hussein” and “I am here, O Hussein” in the video filmed inside the Imam Ali Mosque as the attack unfolded.

439,Trump to speak Thursday - what to expect at Republican convention,"Former US President Donald Trump walked into the Republican National Convention to thunderous applause Monday night in his first public appearance since surviving an assassination attempt.  He arrived just hours after announcing Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running-mate and in doing so shifted the momentum of the convention towards the future of the Republican party. Trump - who was shot in the ear at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday - said, in a social media post, he considered delaying his trip by two days, “but have just decided that I cannot allow a 'shooter,' or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else”. The attack on the candidate has put a heightened focus on the event's safety and security.  But Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, RNC coordinator for the US Secret Service, said Sunday that there would be no changes to the security plan.  The convention, which began on Monday, is being held at the home of the Milwaukee Bucks, an NBA basketball team. Some 50,000 people are expected to attend the four-day jamboree of pageantry, politics and policy as the party makes its case to voters ahead of November’s general election. Once every four years each of the two main US parties hosts a convention to formally select their respective White House standard-bearer and prepare for the final stretch of campaigning. The conferences include high-profile speakers, as well as a prime-time speech from the presidential candidate. During the convention, the delegates from each state pledge their support to the candidate of their choice and approve a platform.  It is merely a formality for Trump as the party's presumptive nominee because he won 2,265 delegates in the primaries, which is enough for the nomination. The Democrats will hold their convention next month in Chicago.  Trump is not expected to speak until Thursday night. One of the biggest moments of the conference came Monday when he announced Mr Vance as his running mate.  Donald Trump Jr, the former president's son, is expected to speak on Wednesday. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, one of Trump’s fiercest rivals during the Republican primary, was originally expected to skip the RNC. But following the assassination attempt, she has reportedly changed her mind and is now expected to speak at the conference on Tuesday. Amber Rose, model, reality star and former girlfriend of Kanye West, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia congresswoman and Teamsters union general president Sean O'Brien were among the speakers who addressed the crowd Monday night.  Arizona Senate contender Kari Lake, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Dana White, head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson are slated to speak in the coming days.  RNC co-chair Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of the former president, said celebrities will also be among the speakers. But former stalwarts of the Republican Party establishment, such George W Bush, Mike Pence and Mitt Romney, are not on the guest list. Monday's theme was ""Make America Wealthy Once Again"", Tuesday will be ""Make America Safe Again"", Wednesday is ""Make America Strong Again"" and Thursday is ""Make America Great Once Again"". The party platform this year is 16 pages. Some themes of Project 2025, a much longer think-tank proposal, are also likely to come up during the convention. Project 2025 - from which Trump has distanced himself - calls for expanding presidential powers, eliminating thousands of civil servant posts, tax cuts and dismantling the Department of Education.  Former first lady Melania Trump, who rarely makes public appearances, will attend the convention, according to US media, though she was not present on Monday when Trump appeared publicly for the first time since the assassination attempt.  Mrs Trump did not attend the 27 June debate between President Joe Biden and Trump. Neither did she attend her husband’s hush-money trial earlier this year. While the former first lady has held Republican fundraisers in the past year, this would be her first major appearance of this election cycle.  The Coalition to March hosted a demonstration Monday afternoon near the site of the convention.  Organisers said they expected 5,000 protestors but the crowd turned out smaller.   Karen Allington, a retired 64-year-old who attended Monday's protest, told the BBC she's worried about Trump’s agenda, which she says is fuelling political division. ""We want to be out here doing something positive,"" she said. ""I’m not sure the delegates will listen, but we want our voices heard."" Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said the city would ensure public safety is paramount this week. “A national special security event is the highest designation that you can get for a security event of its size and magnitude in the United States,” Mayor Johnson said.

434,Defeated Trump rivals to preach unity at Republican convention,"Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from Butler As my colleagues report from the RNC in Milwaukee, I've spent most of the day in Butler, Pennsylvania, speaking to
people who were at the Trump rally on Saturday. The area around the rally site is still very much a crime scene,
with police officers protecting the area near the building
from where they believe Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at the former president. Still, it's a much calmer atmosphere than when I was last here in the hours after the rally, when the entire area was cordoned off by
heavily armed officers as helicopters flew overhead. The overwhelming feeling among attendees I've spoken to is of
anger at the US Secret Service, which they believe made fatal mistakes in its
mission to protect the venue. ""They definitely dropped the ball,"" says Jean Vincent, a
Butler resident who was at the rally with her sister. ""I'm upset someone could have killed us, and my
children,"" she adds. ""It's changed America and it's changed our
community."" The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, will face
the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on 22 July. The next day, she, along with the heads of the FBI and Department
of Homeland Security, have been invited to a separate Homeland Security Committee hearing. Some in Butler, however, say that they will only be satisfied if
Cheatle leaves her post. ""All I want to hear from her is that she resigns,""

433,Biden announces plan to cap rent hikes,"President Joe Biden has announced a new plan to halt rent increases in the US, as Americans battle soaring housing prices.  Mr Biden's proposal - which requires congressional approval - would cut off tax credits for landlords who try to raise rent by more than 5%.  The policy would apply to landlords who own more than 50 units, comprising about 20 million rental units across the country, according to the Biden administration.  Mr Biden said he hoped this plan would send a ""clear message to corporate landlords"".  ""Rent is too high and buying a home is out of reach for too many working families and young Americans, after decades of failure to build enough homes,"" the president said in a statement. ""I’m determined to turn that around."" The proposal does include an exception for new construction and buildings undergoing substantive renovations. As the US faces low housing stock, this carve out is aimed at encouraging new rental property construction to increase the number of apartments and homes available.  The announcement comes as Mr Biden is set to make a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Nevada, while Republicans gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for the party's national convention.  His proposal faces an uphill battle for approval in Congress, with administration officials reportedly acknowledging the president would have to focus on fighting for the housing plan during a second term.  The plan is aimed at stopping corporate landlords who are seeking to take advantage of the US housing shortage by raising rents at a higher rate than their own costs have increased, Mr Biden said.  Nationwide, rent prices have risen by 21% since January 2021, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.  Home prices are on the rise, too.  In early 2024, home prices hit an all-time record, rising 6.4% from February 2023 to 2024, according to a new report from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Mr Biden's plan to lower housing costs come as recent polls show he is trailing his rival, former President Donald Trump, in the 2024 presidential race.  Surveys show the economy is top of mind for voters in the 2024 election, with rising housing costs and ongoing inflation pressures among the top concerns.  As a part of his housing announcement, Mr Biden said he would also direct federal agencies to assess whether public land could be repurposed to build affordable housing options.  In Nevada, where Mr Biden is set to speak on Tuesday, the federal government is looking at 562 acres of public land in the Las Vegas Valley that could be used for affordable housing, according to a White House fact sheet.

432,'World's rarest whale' washes up on NZ beach,"A whale that was found dead on a beach in New Zealand earlier this month has been identified by scientists as a spade-toothed whale - a species so rare it has never been seen alive.  The five-metre long, beaked creature's identity was determined from its colour patterns and the shape of its skull, beak and teeth.  Its remains have been placed in cold storage whilst DNA testing takes place, with experts saying it may take several weeks before a final identification is confirmed.  Because so few specimens have been found and there have been no live sightings, very little is known about the spade-toothed whale. Researchers say the carcass discovery could help them acquire crucial new information about the species. Local officials were notified that the whale had been washed ashore on 4 July at the mouth of the Taiari river, in Otago province on New Zealand's South Island. Department of Conservation (DOC) official Gabe Davies said in a statement that spade-toothed whales were one of the least known large mammalian species, with only six samples ever documented worldwide. ""From a scientific and conservation point of view, this is huge,"" he added. The department said that because the specimen had only recently died it could become the first whale of the species to be dissected. New Zealand's Māori people regard whales as a sacred treasure, and DOC said local Maori communities would take part in deciding the whale's fate. The species was first described in 1874 after a lower jaw and two teeth were collected from New Zealand's Chatham Islands. Skeletal remains of two other specimens found off islands in New Zealand and Chile enabled scientists to confirm a new species.  Two more recent findings of stranded whales off New Zealand's North Island in 2010 and 2017 added to the small collection.

431,Trump security raised weeks ago over Iran plot to kill him,"Protection for Donald Trump was boosted several weeks ago after US authorities learned of an Iranian plot to kill him, according to national security officials.  Officials say there is no known connection between the alleged Iranian plot and the assassination attempt on the former president on Saturday in Pennsylvania. However, the disclosure that security had been tightened raises further questions over how Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was able to climb a building and get close enough to fire at Trump.  The US Secret Service and the Trump campaign were notified of the Iranian threat, and security was increased as a result, according to a US national security official.  Intelligence sources told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that the Secret Service bolstered security in June in response to the Iranian threat. This included extra counter-assault and counter-sniper agents, drones and robotic dogs. CBS reported that the details of a potential Iranian operation were obtained through ""human source intelligence"", and came amid a notable increase in Iranian chatter regarding attacks against Trump. Trump and officials including his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have faced threats from Tehran since ordering the drone strike assassination of Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq in 2020. The Iranian mission at the United Nations called the report ""unsubstantiated and malicious"", adding that Trump was ""a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law"". Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the US Secret Service, said it and other agencies were ""constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed"". ""We cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly.” The Trump campaign said it did not comment on security matters and referred BBC questions to the Secret Service.  Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said that US security officials had been ""tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years"". ""These threats arise from Iran's desire to seek revenge for the killing of Soleimani,"" she said. ""We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority."" She however reiterated that the investigation ""has not identified ties"" between Crooks and ""any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic."" In 2022, the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, alleging that he was orchestrating a plot to kill Mr Bolton. Prosecutors said the plot was “likely in retaliation” for the killing of Soleimani. Questions have swirled about how police officers and agents responsible for the rally at Butler County fairgrounds, Pennsylvania, allowed Crooks to get so close. The director of the Secret Service admitted that local police were inside the building while Crooks was on its roof aiming at Trump 130m (430ft) away. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported three local police snipers were inside the building and had seen Crooks getting on the roof.  The local sheriff's department referred BBC questions to the state police, which said it was not responsible for the area containing the building. A state police spokesman told the BBC that it provided ""all resources"" requested by the Secret Service, including between 30 to 40 troopers inside the perimeter. President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of how the gunman could have come so close to killing Trump, and the Secret Service also faces probes from Congress.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2w8knjryo,"Max Matza,",2024-07-16 20:09:37,
430,Toronto reels from floods and power cuts after severe storms,"Record rainfall from three huge storms has flooded parts of Toronto, cut power and left drivers stranded on the major motorway through the city. Environment Canada reported that almost 100mm (4in) of rain fell on Toronto on Tuesday, surpassing the city's daily record set in 1941. Images and videos showed severe flooding across the city, cars nearly submerged, and water cascading down the staircases at Union Station. The storm left more than 167,000 customers without power, according to Toronto Hydro. Several flights were also delayed or cancelled out of Billy Bishop Airport, on the Toronto Islands in Lake Ontario. The Don Valley Parkway, a major motorway that runs adjacent to the Don river, was blocked in both directions by flooding. Ontario Highway 410 was also closed, with police anticipating that it will not open up for another day as crews clean up. Authorities said they have rescued at least 14 people, including one person who had to be plucked from their car's roof. Toronto's fire service received numerous calls from people trapped in lifts, after large areas of city centre lost power during working hours. Meteorologists said that Tuesday’s record rainfall was due to three consecutive storms that fell on the city. “We had 25 per cent more rain in three hours than we'd have normally in the whole month of July with all the thunderstorms and systems that moved through,” meteorologist Dave Phillips told local news station CP24. The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority warned that areas near shorelines, rivers and streams in the city are especially prone to flooding. There are more than a dozen rivers and streams in Toronto, making it vulnerable to rising water levels. Toronto’s mayor Olivia Chow said she did not know why the Don Valley Parkway, which is prone to flooding, was not closed earlier in the day. She added the city was ""massively investing"" in clean-up efforts to ensure similar flooding does not occur in the future. Toronto suffered from an intense and costly July storm in 2013 that left at least 300,000 people without power and more than 1,000 passengers needing rescue from a flooded train.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4ypd11wr0o,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-16 22:09:37,

The comedy rock group were on stage in Sydney, Australia, on Sunday when Gass was asked to make a wish after being presented with a cake for his 64th birthday. He appeared to reply: ""Don’t miss Trump next time."" In a statement on Instagram, Black said he was ""blindsided"" by the comment. ""I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,"" the comedian and actor wrote. He said he didn’t feel it was ""appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour"", and that the rest of the group’s ""creative plans are on hold"". Black added that he is ""grateful to the fans for their support and understanding"". The controversy had already led to Tuesday's gig in Newcastle, New South Wales, being postponed. Gass apologised for the comment on Instagram, saying it was a ""severe lack of judgement"". He wrote: ""The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. ""I don’t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone. What happened was a tragedy, and I’m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement. I profoundly apologise to those I’ve let down and truly regret any pain I’ve caused."" Gass also split with his agent following the incident. ""Due to what occurred, we have parted ways,"" Michael Greene of Greene Talent told BBC News.

428,Senator Bob Menendez found guilty in bribery scheme,"New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez has been found guilty on 16 counts tied to a scheme where he accepted bribes, including gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, in exchange for helping foreign governments. A jury convicted Menendez of all charges after more than 12 hours of deliberation over three days. The trial lasted nine weeks. Menendez - formerly the head of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee - now faces the prospect of decades in prison. Democratic lawmakers have called on him to step down from Congress in light of his conviction.  ""Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign,"" said Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer in a statement. Speaking to reporters after his conviction, Menendez maintained that he is innocent.  ""I never violated my public oath,"" he said outside the New York City courthouse on Tuesday. ""I have never been but a patriot of my country and for my country."" His lawyer, Adam Fee, said that he was ""surprised and disappointed"" with the jury's guilty verdict and has vowed to appeal ""aggressively."" Prosecutors said the case represented ""shocking levels of corruption."" ""This wasn't politics as usual, this was politics for profit,"" said Damian Williams, an attorney for the Southern District of New York.  ""Now that the jury has convicted Bob Menendez, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end,"" Mr Williams said.  Menendez pleaded not guilty in the trial. His lawyers argued that the gifts he accepted did not qualify as bribes, because prosecutors had failed to prove that he took any specific action as a result of receiving them. His wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, also faces charges in the bribery case, but her trial was delayed so she could undergo breast cancer treatment. She has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers had attempted to shift blame to Mrs Menendez, portraying her as a financially troubled individual who hoped to ""get cash and assets any way she could"". Meanwhile, prosecutors relied on expert testimony, emails and Menendez's text messages to show that the senator accepted lavish rewards from foreign governments. They said the gifts included gold bars worth over $100,000 (£79,000). Some of the bars were handed to jurors as evidence in the trial.  Jurors also heard that FBI agents had found more than $480,000 (£370,452) in cash inside of Menendez's home, some of which was stuffed in envelopes and coats. Two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are also being tried on accusations that they sought out the senator to illegally aid the Egyptian government and secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund.  A third businessman, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified against Mr Menendez in the trial. In exchange the bribes, prosecutors said Menendez helped secure millions of dollars in US aid for Egypt, where Hana had ties to government officials. He was also accused of trying to influence criminal probes involving Daibes and Uribe. Both businessmen were co-defendants in Menendez's case and were also convicted on the counts they faced.  Menendez is currently running as an independent as he campaigns to keep his seat in November's election. Most Democrats in the state walked away from him last year after the release of the indictment showing gold bars stashed in his home. Andy Kim, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, said the verdict marked ""a sad and sombre day"" for his state. ""I called on Senator Menendez to step down when these charges were first made public, and now that he has been found guilty, I believe the only course of action for him is to resign his seat immediately,"" Mr Kim said in a statement. ""The people of New Jersey deserve better,"" he said. The senator has faced federal corruption charges before. He was tried in 2017, with the justice department alleging he did political favours for a wealthy Florida eye doctor in exchange for luxury holidays and other lavish gifts. But that case ended in a mistrial after he was acquitted on some charges and jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict.",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqe6m14drgjo,"Bernd Debusmann Jr & Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-16 19:09:37,
435,JD Vance's 'Hillbilly Elegy' becomes political lightning rod in 2024 election,"As American voters start to familiarize themselves with Donald Trump's newly announced vice-presidential candidate Ohio Senator JD Vance it is nearly impossible to avoid his infamous memoir.   Written in 2016,  ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,"" tells the story of Mr Vance's upbringing in the Appalachian region of the US, which includes his home state of Ohio, and offers a glimpse at what he says life is like for the poor who live in rural areas.  The book, which has garnered critique in the years since it was published, has become a new political lightning rod in the 2024 presidential race as some critics of Mr Vance say it shows a lack of understanding of what it means to be from the region while others argue the opposite. Fans of the rising GOP star are also captivated by the book and purchasing it in large numbers, watching its movie adaptation on streaming platforms and claiming it shows Mr Vance is an everyday man.  The memoir, in its text form or the movie adaptation - which received several Academy Award nominations, may offer voters a glimpse of who Mr Vance is and how he views his upbringing.  The book has become such a popular talking point online that the popular book recommendation site Goodreads blocked new reviews after Trump made the Ohio senator his running mate.  As of Tuesday, users who went to book platform to review Mr Vance's book were met with a popup that read: ""Rating this book is temporarily unavailable. This book has temporary limitations on submitting ratings and reviews. This may be because we've detected unusual behavior that doesn't follow our review guidelines"". This is likely to stop users from review bombing - negatively reviewing something for reasons not associated with the topic itself. Goodreads declined to comment after asked by the BBC about why users had been unable to rate the book. Review bombing, which often happens to movies, books and restaurants after controversy, has become an increasingly common way for people to share their displeasure with something while attempting to sabotage a product, place or person.  In the online era, the practice is only growing in popularity.  It happened to acclaimed ""Eat Pray Love"" writer Elizabeth Gilbert last year after she authored a book readers said was ""glorifying"" Russians. Readers review bombed the book online to the point where Ms Gilbert paused publication.  On top of the online criticism of Mr Vance's book, the movie adaptation has also seen some online hate.  In recent days, Letterboxd, a Goodreads equivalent for movies, also saw an uptick in reviews of the movie adaptation of the book directed by Ron Howard and starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.  But it is not all hate.  The book, in paperback and hardcover, currently ranks No. 1 and No. 2 on Amazon's best-selling books.  The film, which was released in 2020 and received multiple Academy Award nominations at the time, shot to No. 6 on Netflix's top 10 movies the day after Mr Vance's selection was announced.  And while the memoir tells the story of his upbringing, its publication marks the launch of his political career.  ""Hillbilly Elegy"" made Mr Vance a New York Times best-selling author, propelling him to a national platform that he used to become an Ohio senator. Less than two years later, he is now the Republican vice-presidential nominee. ",2024-07-16 23:09:37,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3x4xrq44o,"Ana Faguy,",2024-07-16 21:09:37,

While many 30-year-olds may have one-track careers, US gymnast Aly Raisman can add ""author and advocate"" to a CV already filled with Olympic achievements. The two-time Olympian won six medals as part of the 2012 Team USA ""Fierce Five"" at the London Games, and the 2016 ""Final Five"" at Rio de Janeiro, but is just as proud of her work keeping athletes safe as she is of her time on the podium.  Raisman was one of the victims who suffered abuse at the hands of former Team USA Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. She spoke to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay in this new episode of her Olympian-focused interview series, Influential, about life after the case, her cherished Olympic memories and what legacy she hopes will endure. Back in 2012, Raisman (then aged 18) was tied for fourth place and not expected to medal on the balance beam at the Games in London. She left London the most decorated athlete on the gymnastics team, with three medals. She'd become the first US woman to win gold for the gymnastics floor exercise and Team USA had taken home the women's artistic gymnastics team all-round gold. She'd also won a bronze medal in the balance beam, which still seems to surprise Raisman to this day. Where to find Influential with Katty Kay ""It was such a special experience because I wasn't expected to medal on beam – so getting that bronze medal was one of my most proud moments,"" Raisman tells Kay. Even without the ""pressure to win"", Raisman recalls a fearsome experience. ""Competing in that arena… it's so terrifying, the tension in the arena – you could literally hear a bag of chips open, it's so quiet, so nerve-wracking. You could hear the clicking of the camera! I was so proud of myself for handling that pressure."" Raisman tells Kay that her confidence was affected from the stress and pressure, but after a career-changing pep talk from her coach, she was able to block out the noise, focus on the cheers from her teammates, and get into what she calls a ""flow state"", winning the gold medal on her floor routine.  ""I just had to let go and not think,"" Raisman tells Kay, remembering that moment. ""To this day, it was the best floor routine I've ever done in my entire life. I just felt in a state of 'flow' – which I've never been in before competing. I think because my practice was so stressful… and I was struggling so much, and my confidence wasn't great, letting it go was the best decision I made. I did my first pass on the floor and I just knew the rest of the routine was fine; I felt free and it felt great."" Kay notes that Raisman's smile revealed her happiness to be there, but Raisman reminded her that she also thought it might be the last floor routine of her life at the time and she wanted to do her best for herself, her teammates, her coach, and the country. Yet Raisman kept growing as an athlete and competitor – and as a team leader. ""I was 18 going into London’s 2012 Olympic games; I had just graduated high school,"" Raisman reminds Kay. ""I was such a baby. Going into Rio in 2016, I was 22 years old; I was still so young! But I had been around, so I knew. In London, I was the captain, but still so young. But I felt older in 2016 and my role had shifted in the team. I felt more of that 'mum' role."" Not only did Raisman have to adjust to being the team elder, she faced a lot of change upon returning home to the United States from both London and Rio. Suddenly, she was known around the world; her face was on the covers of magazines. ""It surpassed my expectations – how many people supported us and watched [the Games] and knew us,"" Raisman admits. ""I don't feel like I'll ever get used to [fame]; I'm still navigating it. I went from being in high school… to getting recognised when I go get coffee. I forget people sometimes know who I am! I never imagined that I would have achieved this, still getting recognised [eight years later]. I surpassed my expectations and I'm grateful for that."" Much like Raisman handled mentorship and fame with maturity beyond her years, she wanted to turn her trauma into something that would help people beyond the gymnastics community and use her platform for mental health advocacy. She recently wrote a children's book called From My Head to My Toes, to help young readers understand concepts like consent and bodily autonomy. ""I wanted to write something that empowers children and adults to speak up, while also acknowledging that it's hard to speak up,"" Raisman says. ""I'm 30 years old and it's still hard to speak up. I'm still working on it. But even if [this book] helps one kid be safer and even if it prevents anyone from having to go through what me and my teammates went through, I feel proud of that."" Raisman has also combined her mental health advocacy efforts with her love of fashion and tells Kay that some of the best advice she ever got was from someone she admires in the fashion industry: the shoe designer, Stuart Weitzman. She tells Kay that when the post-Olympics media pressure got to be too much, it was Weitzman who told her something that changed her life. ""The media kept asking if I was coming back for a third Olympics,"" Raisman explains. ""I felt like, 'isn't one [Olympics] enough?' I remember I met with Stuart Weitzman who said to me: 'Don't let the Olympics be the highlight of your life' – and that was one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received. I think about it all the time!""

To Raisman, gymnastics was a literal springboard to empowering people to take care of themselves and others. Just as she's learned to use her voice to speak up in tough moments, she's also learned to compartmentalise, and tells Kay it's not always easy.  ""So many athletes define their worth by their result,"" she tells Kay, ""But [Weitzman's advice] helped me realise that I can go on to do other great things. Obviously winning medals is really exciting and wonderful, but I do hope when people look back at my career, hopefully they remember that I helped make athletes safer and I encouraged people to prioritise mental health."" -- Want to read more about the Olympics?

449,Why Trump picked JD Vance as his running mate,"In 2016, when Donald Trump picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate, it  was widely viewed as an effort to court evangelical Christian voters who may have been wary of supporting Trump, a thrice-married former Democrat. This time around, he opted for JD Vance. And like his previous choice, the Ohio senator’s selection offers some insight into the former president’s campaign strategy – and, possibly, how he would govern if he returns to the White House. The pick suggests Trump knows this election will be won and lost in a handful of industrial Midwest battleground states. A native of Ohio, Mr Vance gained popular attention after the release of his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which tells of his blue-collar upbringing and how it affected his politics and worldview.  With his background, Vance could be well positioned to connect with and energise the kind of white, working class voters who narrowly delivered those states to Trump in 2016. The former president said as much, in the social media post announcing his decision, writing that his running mate “will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota and far beyond"". Trump went on to laud his pick's military service and his Ivy League law school pedigree. At only 39, Vance will provide a youthful counterpoint to the candidates at the top of both presidential tickets. Trump’s choice positions the Ohioan to be at the forefront of a new generation of Maga Republicans. And if the former president returns to the Oval Office next year, Vance will instantly join the conversation for the party’s 2028 presidential nomination. Vance did, however, criticise Trump in the run-up to the election in 2016 - something Democrats were quick to point out - but he has since become an outspoken defender of the former president, particularly on television news networks.  His recent loyalty, and effectiveness, no doubt factored into Trump’s decision. When asked whether he believed Trump’s 2020 election defeat was fairly decided, he has said no. He has also said that, unlike Mr Pence, he would have tried to block the certification of the election results in Congress on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol riot. Mr Vance also aligns closely with the former president’s political ideology. They have similar views on trade, immigration and foreign policy. Mr Vance has been particularly critical of continued US support for Ukraine. In areas where the two men differed, Mr Vance has moved toward his new running mate. He has, for example, backed away from an earlier stand against allowing women who are the victims of rape or incest from having access to abortions. Trump over the course of his campaign has laid out some of his plans for governing in a second term – with across-the-board tariffs, a pledge to deport tens of millions of undocumented migrants and an aggressive realignment of the federal bureaucratic workforce. The Vance pick is further evidence that Trump has doubled-down on Trumpism. That, too, is something his Democratic opponents are sure to point out. On Monday, Mr Biden told reporters he didn’t see any difference between Mr Vance and the former president. “He’s a clone of Trump on the issues,” he added. That, of course, may be exactly what Trump wants.",2024-07-16 23:09:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv50z8dzj5o,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-16 04:09:38,
448,The dark life of the golfer banned for being too good,"Bobby Locke's four major titles all came at the Open Championship Warning: This article includes reference to alcoholism, domestic violence and suicide. When Bobby Locke coined his immortal phrase 'drive for show, putt for dough', it was just another flag the great South African planted in the story of golf. For 20 years, Locke was never beaten over 72 holes in his native land. How good was he? When he went to the United States and competed against the Ben Hogans and the Sam Sneads he won six times in 1947 and another four times in 1948 and 1949. He finished in the top four in 34 of 59 tournaments until a trumped-up charge was brought against him by the Tour and he was banned.  Claude Harmon, father of Tiger Woods' former coach Butch and Masters champion in 1948, put it succinctly: ""Locke was simply too good. They had to ban him."" They reinstated him in 1951, but his unique look - baggy plus-fours, white silk shirts and a necktie - wasn't seen so much in the US after that. There was really no need.  He won in South Africa, England, Scotland, France, Mexico, Egypt. Germany, Switzerland and Australia. He wasn't in thrall to the States. He was a world player. When he came to his spiritual home of the British links, he won four Open Championships in nine years, the first at Sandwich - the name he later picked for the apartment complex he owned in Johannesburg -  then at Troon in 1950 in what was then a record low score in the four-round format. That same year, 1950, was when hapless Herman Tissies, the German amateur, got licked by the Postage Stamp, taking 15 shots to complete the devilish par-three.  Bobby Locke  with the Open trophy in 1952, after winning it for the third time in four years at Lytham St Annes Locke was the first man to go back-to-back in The Open since Walter Hagen won his third and fourth titles in the late 1920s. Hogan was asked about Locke's ability with the short stick. ""Everyone examines greens, but only he knows what he's looking for,"" said the champion golfer of 1953. ""He was the greatest putter I have ever seen,"" said seven-time major winner Snead. ""He'd hit a 20-footer, and before the ball got halfway, he'd be tipping his hat to the crowd. He wore out his hats tipping them."" ""One six-foot putt for my life?"" pondered fellow South African great Gary Player. ""I'll take Bobby Locke. I've seen them all and there has never been a putter like him."" Old Mutton Face, they called him. Or Droopy Chops. Or Vinegar Puss. The monikers were a touch unkind. Locke had a lighter side, a smiling and charismatic presence when the stars were aligned, but there was a grumpy side, too. He didn't like fans who took pictures of him and he knew his own worth. If a journalist wanted an interview that included any golf tips he'd charge $100. Pay up or shut up. He was lethal but not exactly quick. He went at his own pace in tournaments and some of his peers didn't like him for it and liked him less when he ambled away with the winners' loot. He sparked resentment, mostly because of his excellence. All you need to know about The Open 2024 Listen to the latest episode of The Chipping Forecast Read more from Tom English When writing about Bobby Locke, you soon figure out there were different versions of the same man. He was a fighter pilot in the South African Air Force during World War Two, apparently flying 100 combat missions in the Mediterranean and Western Desert. Champion golfer, war hero and miracle man. In 1960, seven years after he won his third Claret Jug at Lytham and three years after he won his fourth at St Andrews, Locke's wife, Mary, gave birth to a baby girl, Carolyn. On his way to see the new arrival, the car Locke was travelling in stopped at a level crossing to let a train go by, then pulled out, not knowing that there was another coming in the opposite direction. The vehicle flew 30 yards through the air and down a bank. Locke went through the back window. For two days he lay unconscious in the same hospital as his wife and daughter. It took a month before he could open his left eye. He had double vision, migraines, memory loss and severe pain in both legs.  Medication and mood swings became part of his daily existence. So did alcohol. He didn't lose his life on that railway track, but Locke the golfer certainly died that day and an altogether different person replaced him. He was 43 years old. Max Robertson (right) interviews Locke on the BBC's Sportsview programme in 1957 Darkness enveloped him. In 1969 he was arrested for drink-driving. Then there was the incident with painter Big Boy Ndlovu, whose work on Locke's apartment block was deemed below par.  Big Boy asked for 220 rand for his services, but Locke refused to pay. Words were exchanged, Locke pulled a gun and shot Big Boy in the shoulder. He was done for attempted murder, paid a fine of 120 rand and had his gun licence suspended for six months.  In a Sports Illustrated piece from 2001 a friend of the family spoke about Locke's new-found casual cruelty towards his wife, Mary, and, worse again, the physical abuse he visited upon her. ""He couldn't think straight,"" said the source. ""He wasn’t rational any more."" In early March 1987, Locke, 69, was admitted to a nursing home in Johannesburg. He was diagnosed with meningitis, fell into a coma and died the following day. The tributes were effusive. Most focused on the storied first half of his life rather than his tragic second act. Mary and daughter, Carolyn, remained loving to the end, which came in 2000 in the home that was once Sandwich but which they'd renamed Bobby Locke Place. In a final twist to a horrific story, Mary, 80, and Carolyn, 40, planned a grisly end - a suicide pact. Having grown fearful for their own safety in a once salubrious area that was now rife with crime, they became reclusive, amended their wills, arranged for their dog to be put down and for his ashes to spread on their grave. They were discovered dead in bed, holding hands after drinking champagne to wash down tablets they'd been gathering for months. ""I just want to be with Bobby again,"" Mary had said to her neighbours for some time. None of them could have known that it would end this way. Locke is remembered not for the husk of a man he became after his near fatal accident or for the horrible fate of his nearest and dearest, but for his greatness on the golf course. His victory in 1950 will get a mention or two this week. The other stuff? Not so much.

447,What we know about the Trump attacker,"The small Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park in Pennsylvania is reeling after the FBI named a young local man, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as the person who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign rally and shocked the nation. Investigators believe that Crooks, armed with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, opened fire at the former president while he was addressing a crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania, leaving one audience member dead and two others wounded.  The 20-year-old kitchen worker was shot dead at the scene by a Secret Service sniper, officials said.  In his well-to-do hometown, however, neighbours are in shock, seemingly unable to grasp how a quiet young man is now accused in the shooting. The FBI, for its part, has said only that Crooks was the ""subject involved in the assassination attempt on the former president and that an active investigation was under way."" Thomas Crooks had not been carrying ID, so investigators used DNA and facial recognition technology to identify him, the FBI said. He was from Bethel Park in Pennsylvania, about 70km (43 miles) from the site of the attempted assassination, and graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School with a $500 (£385) prize for maths and science, according to a local newspaper.  Crooks worked in a local nursing home kitchen just a short drive away from his home, where staff members have said that he passed a background check and raised no concerns.  The Community College of Allegheny, or CCAC, has confirmed that Crooks attended the school between September 2021 and May 2024. He graduated with an associate degree in engineering science.  In a statement sent to the BBC, the college noted that he graduated ""with high honours"" and that a review of his records turned up no disciplinary, student conduct or security-related incidents.  The University of Pittsburgh also told the BBC that in February he was was accepted as a transfer student there for the fall 2024 semester. The following month, he elected not to attend.  State voter records show that he was a registered Republican, according to US media. He also donated $15 to liberal campaign group ActBlue in 2021, according to an election donation filing and news reports. He had a membership at a local shooting club, the Clairton Sportsmen's Club, for at least a year, the club confirmed to the BBC.  The vast club is based south of Pittsburgh and is “one of the premier shooting facilities in the tri-state area” of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. It has more than 2,000 members. It has multiple gun ranges, including a high-power rifle facility with targets up to 171 metres away. The club's owner, Bill Sellitto, told the BBC that the shooting was a ""terrible, terrible thing"". Access to the club is tightly controlled, with only members allowed inside the sprawling facility.  “Obviously, the club fully admonishes the senseless act of violence,” attorney Robert S Bootay III, who represents the organisation, told the BBC.  Law enforcement officials believe the weapon used to shoot at Donald Trump, an AR-style rifle, was purchased by Crooks' father, according to investigators.  It is unclear how the weapon came into his son's hands, although there is no suggestion the father had any inkling of what was to take place.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, two officers told AP that Crooks' father bought the weapon at least six months ago.  Authorities say that Crooks purchased a box of ammunition containing 50 rounds on the day of the rally, reports CBS, the BBC's US news partner. Police sources have also told CBS that he purchased a ladder at Home Depot before the shooting, although it is unclear if he brought it with him. According to US media reports, Crooks was wearing a T-shirt from Demolition Ranch, a YouTube channel known for its guns and demolition content. The channel has millions of subscribers featuring videos on different guns and explosive devices. The day after the shooting, law enforcement sources also told CBS that suspicious devices were found in Crooks' vehicle. According to CBS, the suspect had a piece of commercially available equipment that appeared capable of initiating the devices.  Bomb technicians were called to the scene to secure and investigate the devices.  Having established Crooks' identity, police and agencies are investigating his motive. So far, they have been unable to identify one.  On 15 July, the FBI said its forensic experts have successfully accessed Crooks' phone, and they are examining it and other digital evidence for clues.  The inquiry into what took place could last for months and investigators would work ""tirelessly"" to identify what Crooks' motive was, Kevin Rojek, the FBI Pittsburgh special agent in charge, said on the day of the shooting. Speaking to CNN, Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out “what the hell is going on” but would “wait until I talk to law enforcement” before speaking about his son.  Crooks' family is cooperating with investigators, according to the FBI.  Citing three law enforcement sources, CBS has reported that his father called police after the shooting, although the nature of that call is still unclear.   In total, more than 100 interviews have so far been conducted.  Police sealed off the road to the house where Crooks lived with his parents. The search of the residence was completed on 15 July. A neighbour told CBS that officers evacuated her in the middle of the night with no warning. Bethel Park Police said there was a bomb investigation surrounding Crooks' home. Access to the area remains controlled, with a police vehicle blocking entry to the street in front of the house. On Tuesday afternoon, yellow police tape could be seen strung up in front of the residence. The BBC had a clear view of the back of the residence, but could not see any movement inside. Only residents have been allowed in or out of the street. Law enforcement sources told CBS that they believe there was some degree of planning ahead of the shooting. How much time was spent in that planning, however, remains the subject of an ongoing investigation. Police believe Crooks acted alone, but are continuing to investigate whether he was accompanied to the rally. So far, a confusing - and at times conflicting - picture has emerged of who Crooks was as a person.  Speaking to local news outlet KDKA, some young locals who went to school with him described him as a loner, who was frequently bullied and sometimes wore ""hunting outfits to school"".  Another former classmate of his, Summer Barkley, cast him differently, telling the BBC that he was ""always getting good grades on tests"" and was ""very passionate about history"".  ""Anything on government and history he seemed to know about,"" she said. ""But it was nothing out of the ordinary... he was always nice.""  She described him as well-liked by his teachers. Others simply remembered him as quiet.  ""He was there but I can't think of anyone who knew him well,"" one former classmate, who asked to remain nameless, told the BBC. ""He's just not a guy I really think about. But he seemed fine."" Another classmate, who similarly did not want to be identified, described him as ""intelligent but a little weird."" Staff at Angelo's Pizza, a restaurant in Bethel Park, told the BBC they were familiar with Crooks.  The restaurant's owner, Sara Petko, said that staff members - some of whom were his classmates - thought he was a ""loner"" but that they were having trouble understanding how an otherwise quiet man turned to violence. ""It's just crazy, and too close for comfort,"" she said. ""To think that someone at basically the start of his life could do this."" Jameson Myers, a former member of the Bethel Park High School varsity rifle team who graduated alongside Crooks in 2022, told CBS that Crooks did not make the team.  ""He did not even make the junior varsity team after trying out,"" Mr Myers added. ""He never returned to try-outs for the remainder of high school.""  Another former classmate told ABC News he ""shot terrible"" and ""wasn't really fit for the rifle team"". The school district said there was no record of Crooks trying out for the team and he ""never appeared on a roster"". Mr Myers remembers Crooks as seemingly a ""normal boy"" who was ""not particularly popular but never got picked on or anything"".  “He was a nice kid who never talked poorly of anyone and I never have thought him capable of anything I’ve seen him do in the last few days.” Max Smith, who took an American history course with Crooks, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that his former classmate ""definitely was conservative"". Mr Smith recalled a mock debate in which they both took part, saying: ""The majority of the class were on the liberal side, but Tom, no matter what, always stood his ground on the conservative side."" ""It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate,"" he said. Other community members said simply that they were shocked that the alleged perpetrator of the shooting could have come from the quiet, tree-lined streets of Bethel Park.  Among them was Jason Mackey, a 27-year-old local man who lives near the Crooks residence and worked at his school while he was a student.  While Mr Mackey said that he did not know Crooks personally, he is still reeling from a sense of disbelief.  ""It's just shocking. You wouldn't think an event of this magnitude would come right out of your backyard,"" he said. ""It's just a crazy situation."" One person was killed and two others were injured in the shooting.  All three victims are adult men and were audience members, CBS News reports.  At a news conference on Sunday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro identified the deceased victim as Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old volunteer fire chief who was killed when he ""dived on his family"" to protect them. He said that Comperatore ""died a hero"".  The two people injured in the attack have been identified as 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver.  Both men are Pennsylvania residents and are in stable condition.  A GoFundMe page, organised by the Trump campaign's national finance director Meredith O'Rourke, was set up in the hours after the attack with donations going to the families of the injured. It has so far raised more than $340,000 (£267,000). In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear"" and said he felt the bullet ""ripping through the skin"". Blood was visible on Trump's ear and face as protection officers rushed him away. Trump is ""doing well"" and is grateful to law enforcement officers, according to a statement published on the Republican National Committee (RNC) website. He travelled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Sunday, a day after the shooting, to attend the Republican National Convention. One witness told the BBC that he had seen a man – believed to be Crooks - with a rifle on the roof of a building before Trump was shot.  “There are police running around. We’re telling them there’s a guy on the roof with a rifle,” Greg Smith told the BBC. “Secret Service is looking at us through binoculars, and I’m pointing right at the roof.""  Multiple videos appear to confirm that chain, with some showing rallygoer shouting at police.  Video footage obtained by TMZ shows the moment the shooting began. The assailant opened fire with “an AR-style rifle”, officials have said. His shooting position was approximately 443ft (135m) from Trump.  Law enforcement sources also told CBS that he was reported by a bystander and identified as a suspicious person by police, but that officers lost track of him before the shooting began.  A Secret Service sniper returned fire and killed the gunman, officials said. Footage later shows armed officers approaching a body on the roof of the building.",2024-07-16 23:09:38,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gw58wv4e9o,"Bernd Debusmann, Tom Bateman and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-16 16:09:38,
445,'Struggling' Drag Race star takes a step back,"Drag queen Trixie Mattel will be taking a break from work after ""struggling"" for more than a year. Trixie became a world renowned star after first appearing on Ru Paul's Drag Race in 2015. Since then, the queen returned for the All Stars version and as host of the spin-off show The Pit Stop, as well as running a YouTube channel and make-up business.  Trixie told fans in a video that all the work was ""not sustainable"" and there would be ""a hiatus"" for at least three months.  ""I need a complete reboot,"" says Trixie, who uses she/her pronouns in drag and he/him when not performing.  It was a rare video where Trixie, real name Brian Firkus, was out of drag. ""I feel uncomfortable about telling so much of myself,"" Brian says, before opening up about a tough year. ""Things happened this year that I’m not ready to talk about, it just really beat it out of me and taught me new lows of the human experience. ""When you feel like you cannot stop crying and you’re so upset and then you have to put on a wig and make people laugh - it is chilling."" Brian says he'd been working himself to ""death"" as Trixie and had become ill from stress. It got to a point where he ""struggled to enjoy"" drag, which ""I feel weird complaining about because all my wildest dreams came true"". Brian grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and has previously shared his experience of growing up in poverty. ""Growing up poor is traumatising,"" he says in the latest video, saying it's affected his work ethic. ""You can’t take a day off because there’s a pay cheque waiting. ""All I was doing was this. It was all work and money making and then my social life, my family life, my personal life… twigs. Frail twigs."" As well as Drag Race, Trixie is well known for working with drag queen Katya Zamolodchikova - the pair often perform together and also have a Netflix series and online show UNHhhh. Since 2022 Trixie's also had her own show on Discovery+, Trixie Motel, which follows the drag queen as she renovates a motel in California.  Brian told fans: ""I love doing all my little jobs"" as Trixie but has realised ""it’s a good thing to have boundaries"". ""Being a hard worker is fierce, being a hard worker at the expense of your real life and health is not,"" he says. ""When you have the fortune that I’ve had, you shouldn’t be stupid and abuse it like I have."" Brian says he'll be visiting friends and family and will also be taking a break from social media. ""This break is so overdue,"" he says. ""I don’t know what I’m going to come back as, maybe not even as a drag queen, who knows?

446,Jay Slater's mum says 'our hearts are broken' after son's body found in Tenerife,"The mother of British teenager Jay Slater says the family's ""hearts are broken"" after a body found in Tenerife was confirmed as her son. Debbie Duncan said in statement that her son's death was the ""worst news"", adding: ""I just can’t believe this could happen to my beautiful boy."" Officials say the 19-year-old's death is a result of ""trauma consistent with a fall in a rocky area"", adding that fingerprint tests showed the body found in Masca on Monday was Mr Slater. Earlier, charity LBT Global had confirmed that Mr Slater's possessions were also discovered near his last known location.  The teenager, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, was last seen on 17 June, after visiting an Airbnb rented by two people he had been with at the NRG music festival on the island. Earlier, the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands said: ""We have a positive identification and more data: fingerprint tests show that the body is [that] of Jay Slater and that the death was caused by trauma consistent with a fall in a rocky area."" LBT Global’s Matthew Searle was with Mr Slater’s mother when they heard the news that the body had been identified as her son and said the family were devastated. He said: ""The announcement does seem to confirm that Jay died of injuries consistent with an accidental fall from a considerable height."" Mr Searle said the charity, which helps families in missing persons cases overseas, would be supporting the family ""to make this horrific time as easy as possible"". He added: ""We are working with the family now to sort out the next steps of taking Jay home, recovery of his belongings and laying him to rest."" An earlier court statement today said that documentation found with the body belonged to the apprentice bricklayer. ""It is confirmed that the documentation that was on the body found yesterday in the mountains of Masca belongs to Jay Slater,"" it said. It went on to add that ""everything suggests that it was an accidental fall"" but the results of the official investigation into the death would take more time. Mr Slater's body was discovered by members of a mountain rescue team from the Spanish Civil Guard, near the village of Masca, on Monday.  Just two weeks ago, the civil guard on the island said the search had been called off, though the investigation remained open. It is now clear that, in fact, the force was continuing with searches during this time. Hinting at a possible reason, police said they made efforts to ""preserve the natural space to ensure it did not fill up with curious onlookers"". That appeared to be a reference to the huge interest the case generated in the UK, particularly on social media, where bizarre conspiracy theories were circulating and which even led to some online sleuths travelling to Tenerife to join in the search. In contrast to the UK, where officers will often give briefings during investigations, the Spanish police give very little information to the media while cases like this are open. They did, however, say that nothing had been ruled out. It is possible that this approach allowed the information vacuum to be filled by ""curious onlookers"". Announcing the halting of the search yet continuing it in a low-key, virtually secret, way allowed the online noise - and media attention - to subside. Nonetheless, the police do appear keen to demonstrate how demanding the search has been and why it has taken so long. Video released by the civil guard showed just how difficult it was to access the steep rocky area where the body was discovered. Earlier, a friend of Jay Slater paid tribute to ""the happiest and most smiley person in the room"". Lucy Law, who was the last known person to speak to Mr Slater during a phone call on 17 June, paid tribute to him on her Instagram page. She said: ""Honestly lost for words. Always the happiest and most smiley person in the room, you was (sic) one of a kind Jay and you'll be missed more than you know."" Ms Law's tribute continued: ""I'm sure you'll 'have your dancing shoes polished and ready' waiting for us all. ""We all love you buddy. Fly high."" Accrington and Rossendale College, where Mr Slater was studying as an apprentice bricklayer, said it was ""deeply saddened"" to hear the news of his death. It added, Mr Slater was a ""hard-working apprentice"" at the college ""with a very bright future ahead of him"". ""Our thoughts and condolences go out to his family, friends, and all who knew and loved him."" The head teachers of the primary and high school Mr Slater attended in Oswaldtwistle have issued a joint tribute to him. Andrew Williams, head teacher of Rhyddings High School, and James McBride, head teacher of West End Primary School, said: ""All members of our school communities, both past and present, share in our condolences and deepest sympathies for those who knew Jay. ""As a devoted mother, we know Debbie would have never given up looking for Jay, and she and the family are firmly in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time."" About 100 people attended a vigil in memory of Mr Slater at West End Methodist Church in Oswaldtwistle earlier, where they released balloons. Friend Holly Kidd said she ""always hoped he would be alright"". ""I used to go out with him round town. He was such a lovely lad, it's really upsetting. Just a really good friend. I just want him to know that we all miss him and we always will,"" she said. Carly Armstrong, whose son was friends with the teenager, said: ""It's been heartbreaking. They grew up together. ""If I could have gone over and searched the mountains myself I would have. It could have been any of them really, it's just devastating. ""I want to show Jay's mum that we all love her, are thinking of her and are all here."" Pam Kerann  who coached Mr Slater at football when he was younger, said: ""It's nice for the community to come together and remember Jay.  ""Everyone's got their own memories of him. He's a mop-haired little footballer to me."" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

451,Trump security boosted weeks ago over Iran plot to kill him,"Protection for Donald Trump was boosted several weeks ago after US authorities learned of an Iranian plot to kill him, according to national security officials.  Officials say there is no known connection between the alleged Iranian plot and the assassination attempt on the former president on Saturday in Pennsylvania. However, the disclosure that security had been tightened raises further questions over how Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was able to climb a building and get close enough to fire at Trump.  The US Secret Service and the Trump campaign were notified of the Iranian threat, and security was increased as a result, according to a US national security official.  Intelligence sources told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that the Secret Service bolstered security in June in response to the Iranian threat. This included extra counter-assault and counter-sniper agents, drones and robotic dogs. CBS reported that the details of a potential Iranian operation were obtained through ""human source intelligence"", and came amid a notable increase in Iranian chatter regarding attacks against Trump. Trump and officials including his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have faced threats from Tehran since ordering the drone strike assassination of Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq in 2020. The Iranian mission at the United Nations called the report ""unsubstantiated and malicious"", adding that Trump was ""a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law"". Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the US Secret Service, said it and other agencies were ""constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed"". ""We cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly.” The Trump campaign said it did not comment on security matters and referred BBC questions to the Secret Service.  Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said that US security officials had been ""tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years"". ""These threats arise from Iran's desire to seek revenge for the killing of Soleimani,"" she said. ""We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority."" She however reiterated that the investigation ""has not identified ties"" between Crooks and ""any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic."" In 2022, the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, alleging that he was orchestrating a plot to kill Mr Bolton. Prosecutors said the plot was “likely in retaliation” for the killing of Soleimani. Questions have swirled about how police officers and agents responsible for the rally at Butler County fairgrounds, Pennsylvania, allowed Crooks to get so close. The director of the Secret Service admitted that local police were inside the building while Crooks was on its roof aiming at Trump 130m (430ft) away. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported three local police snipers were inside the building and had seen Crooks getting on the roof.  The local sheriff's department referred BBC questions to the state police, which said it was not responsible for the area containing the building. A state police spokesman told the BBC that it provided ""all resources"" requested by the Secret Service, including between 30 to 40 troopers inside the perimeter. President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of how the gunman could have come so close to killing Trump, and the Secret Service also faces probes from Congress.",2024-07-16 23:09:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2w8knjryo,"Max Matza,",2024-07-16 20:09:39,
452,Senior North Korean diplomat defects to South,"A high-profile North Korean diplomat stationed in Cuba has defected to the South, Seoul's spy agency has confirmed to the BBC. The political counselor is believed to be the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to escape to South Korea since 2016. The diplomat defected in November, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said. Details about defections of North Koreans often take months to come to light as the defectors must take courses on South Korean society before they are formally integrated.   South Korean media reports say that the defector was a counsellor responsible for political affairs at the North Korean embassy in Cuba. The NIS has not confirmed this to the BBC. The Chosun Ilbo newspaper said it was able to interview the diplomat, whom it identified as 52-year-old Ri Il Kyu. It added that he defected because of ""disillusionment with the North Korean regime and a bleak future"". His work reportedly involved stopping Havana from forging official diplomatic ties with Seoul. However, in February, the  two governments did establish official relations, in what was seen as a setback for Pyongyang. ""Every North Korean thinks at least once about living in South Korea,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. The last known high-profile defection to the South was that of Tae Yong-ho in 2016. He is North Korea's former deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom. On Sunday, South Korea marked its very first North Korean Defectors' Day ceremony. Addressing the ceremony, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol promised better financial support for North Korean defectors and tax incentives for companies hiring them. Mr Yoon, a conservative, has taken a more hawkish approach towards North Korea and on foreign policy general, compared to his predecessor Moon Jae-In. He supports sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime and has promised to develop technology to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea if Pyongyang looks to attack Seoul. The latest defection comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two Koreas. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has formally abandoned the goal of reunification with with the South and also recently branded Seoul as ""Enemy number One"" - a dramatic turnaround from just six years ago when he formally met then South Korean Leader Moon Jae In. Since then, there has been an upping of rhetoric on both sides of the border.  The two countries floated propaganda balloons along their border towns, with those from the North containing trash and parasites. And earlier in June, Pyongyang claimed to have test-fired an advanced nuclear warhead missile. ",2024-07-16 23:09:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv3xk9klwzo,Unknown,2024-07-16 09:09:39,
453,Who will be next England manager?,"Graham Potter, Eddie Howe and Mauricio Pochettino (left to right) are among those being touted as Gareth Southgate's successor England are on the hunt for a new manager. After 102 matches at the helm, stretching eight years, Gareth Southgate has quit as Three Lions boss after defeat by Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final. He will be a tough act to follow as - on top of overseeing England's run to the Euro 2024 final - Southgate has taken his country to the Euro 2020 final, a World Cup semi-final and a World Cup quarter-final. So, who could follow him? BBC Sport takes a look at some of the contenders before asking you to choose who you would like in charge. Perhaps a left field candidate but England Under-21 manager Lee Carsley is well thought of at the Football Association. He has been with the FA a long time and won the European Under-21 Championship last summer. He could potentially buy the FA time  as an interim manager until a big name was free next summer. Southgate managed the under-21s between 2013 and 2016 before becoming the senior boss. Carsley, 50, held talks about becoming Republic of Ireland manager last year but opted to stay with the under-21s for another cycle. The Manchester City boss has long been mooted as a future international manager and a role with England would certainly excite many Three Lions fans. Having won everything there is to win at club level with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, a new challenge next summer could prove very attractive. Guardiola is under contract at City until the summer of 2025, but after that? You couldn't rule it out, although his wages could be another stumbling block. Another English manager well fancied by the bookmakers. The Newcastle boss has long been talked about as a potential England manager since impressing in charge of Bournemouth. He has further enhanced his reputation at Newcastle - leading them in the Champions League in 2023-24, although they will not play in Europe next season. The 46-year-old is tied to a long-term contract, understood to be until 2027, but it might be hard for Howe to turn down the opportunity if England came calling. BBC Sport's football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella says: ""Those close to Howe believe he is on the FA's shortlist, amid widespread reports of his candidacy."" Speaking on Tuesday, Newcastle chief executive Darren Eales said the club would fight to keep their manager. ""We're on an exciting journey and, as far as we're concerned, Eddie is the man to lead us on that,"" he said. Another big-name manager out of work. If the FA was minded to go down the route of attracting a name from abroad, Klopp would surely be on its list of contenders. The former Liverpool manager is unlikely to be available right now, having stepped down at Anfield and wanting a break. But - should the FA be willing to wait - Klopp could come into the reckoning. The 57-year-old is already being touted both for the vacant United States job and as a possible successor for Julian Nagelsmann, should he leave Germany.  Another high-profile, popular, foreign manager out of work this summer. The former Tottenham, PSG and Chelsea boss was heavily linked with Manchester United - before Erik ten Hag's contract was extended - and would relish returning to work in England. He is keen to become Southgate's successor, lives in London, and his passion for football in this country makes him a serious contender. Pochettino is also believed to not need any break from football after leaving Chelsea by mutual consent in May. The former Brighton boss is one of the favourites among the bookmakers after impressing in three years in charge at Brighton.  His reputation did suffer a bit of blow when he was sacked by Chelsea after less than seven months in charge in April 2023, but he remains one of English football's most respected coaches. There is a major question mark about whether he would want an international job over a club role though, and he rejected a chance to manage Sweden in the past before discussing moves to Ajax and Leicester. The England job would surely be too big to turn down though and it is thought Potter turned down Leicester earlier this summer, with half on eye on a future England role. Another highly rated manager who is looking for work this summer. A legend at Chelsea for helping the club win the Champions League in 2021, he left his job at Bayern Munich at the end of last season, despite talks to persuade him to stay. Tuchel, who has also managed at the likes of Paris St-Germain and Borussia Dortmund, would relish a return to English football and is believed to be open to talks with the FA about being Southgate’s successor.  He reportedly came close to replacing Erik ten Hag at Manchester United before they stuck with the Dutchman after his FA Cup win. BBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella says: ""Sources close to Tuchel have told me that he remains interested in the role. ""However, he is not expecting to be contacted by the FA and is considered an outsider given the position of the other candidates"". Ipswich fans will not like reading this but their manager Kieran McKenna is fast growing a reputation as one the country's best coaches. The England job could come too soon, but do not be surprised to see his name mentioned. Former Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is another name being mentioned by some, along with Middlesbrough coach Michael Carrick, Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers and ex-Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.

454,Further delays to Young Thug trial after judge removed,"The judge who has been overseeing the long-running racketeering trial against Young Thug has been removed. The Atlanta rapper’s charges were put on hold earlier this month after lawyers for him and co-defendant Deamonte Kendrick asked for the judge to be recused over misconduct allegations. Their lawyers accused Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville of holding an ""improper"" meeting on 10 June when he met privately with prosecutors and a key witness. Glanville maintained that the meeting was proper and argued that no one gained a tactical advantage as a result but while Judge Rachel Krause did not fault him for holding the meeting, she ordered the clerk of court to assign the case to a different judge.  It will now be overseen by Judge Shukura Ingram, according to Rolling Stone.  Krause said she had “no doubt that Judge Glanville can and would continue presiding fairly over this matter"". But the motion was granted out of the ""necessity of preserving the public’s confidence in the judicial system"", AP reported. Krause acknowledged that the meeting “could have - and perhaps should have - taken place in open court"". Brian Steel, a lawyer for Young Thug, said in an emailed statement to AP that his client is innocent and sought to clear his name through a fair trial.   The news has caused more delays in the trial for the rapper, whose real name is Jeffery Lamar Williams. His case has only inched forward since his arrest in May 2022. Jury selection for the trial - which has included testimony from dozens of witnesses - took nearly 10 months. Prosecutors have accused the Atlanta rapper of co-founding a violent street gang in his hometown, hitting him with racketeering charges. Georgia prosecutors used the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act - famously used in mafia prosecutions - to charge the rapper and 27 associates who were allegedly involved in the criminal enterprise. Mr Williams, 32, is also charged with gang, drug and gun crimes and is standing trial with five of the others indicted with him. Mr Kendrick's lawyer told Rolling Stone that they are considering requesting a mistrial following the recusal.",2024-07-16 23:09:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydv8mz85g3o,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-16 11:09:39,
455,Near misses and risk-taking filmed at crossings,"Video of dangerous incidents at level crossings has been released as part of a summer safety campaign. In June, a girl was filmed running across a crossing in Fishbourne, West Sussex, just a couples of metres in front of an advancing train. Recent CCTV footage also showed people hanging from rising crossing barriers in Chertsey, Surrey; rushing cyclists colliding in Hounslow, London; and a car swerving to avoid closing barriers in Bramley, Hampshire. Network Rail, which released the video, said July was a peak time for incidents. Sam Pead, a regional level crossing manager, said: “It’s frustrating we continue to see people recklessly risking their lives when crossing the railway. ""Across the Southern region, trains can travel as fast as 140mph (225km/h) and are largely powered by the third rail which carries more than enough electricity to kill or seriously injure and is always on."" Farnham in Surrey and Star Lane in Wokingham, Berkshire, were the most abused level crossings in the Wessex region last year, Network Rail said. Addlestone and Ash in Surrey and Poole High Street in Dorset also recorded more than one incident per month. In Chertsey, the CCTV film showed a truck tearing off a barrier in the driver's effort to escape the tracks. Incidents involving poorly trained or uncontrolled dogs were a post-Covid trend, Network Rail said. Clappers Lane in Ferring, West Sussex, recorded near misses involving a dog walker and a cyclist. Another dog walker ignored a stop sign at Ashtead Common, Surrey, and a dog was also filmed waiting alone on the track at the same location. The firm reported 28 near misses in the Wessex region in the 2023-24 financial year, which was 13% fewer than the year before. However, incidents of level crossing misuse in the region rose by 24% to 466. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

456,Kenya serial killer suspect tortured to confess - lawyer,"A man described as a ""serial killer"" by Kenya's police was tortured into making a confession, his lawyer has told a court in capital, Nairobi. Police said that Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, confessed to having killed 42 women since 2022, including his own wife, after his arrest on Monday. He was detained following the recent discovery of nine mutilated bodies at an abandoned quarry in Nairobi. Prosecutors denied that he had been mistreated and the court said the suspect could be held for a month, pending further investigations. John Maina Ndegwa, Mr Khalusha's lawyer, said his client had been molested by officers and it was ""laughable"" to suggest that he had confessed. After the hearing, at which Mr Khalusha appeared in handcuffs but did not speak, his lawyer said he hoped the confession would be expunged from the court records. ""He says he was strangled to confess. You could tell he was in distress, terrified and in anguish,"" Mr Ndegwa told the BBC. He added that he had asked that his client be taken to hospital for urgent treatment. Mr Khalusha was arrested at a bar early on Monday morning as he was watching the Euro 2024 football final between Spain and England. He then led officers to his house near the crime scene where 10 phones, a laptop, identity cards and personal female clothing were found, police said. Since Friday, police have cordoned off the dumpsite, the Mukuru quarry, where the bodies were found in various stages of decomposition. The victims were aged between 18 and 30 and were all killed in the same way, according to the police. There has been shock and outrage in Kenya over the murders - and anger directed towards the police that such crimes could have gone unnoticed for so long. Kenya's police have been accused of widespread human rights abuses in the past - and the force is currently under investigation over deaths and abductions following recent anti-government protests.

460,Wood recalled by England for second West Indies Test,"Wood's most recent Test was the fifth Test in India in March  England have recalled pace bowler Mark Wood to their XI for the second Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge, starting on Thursday. Wood takes the place of the retired James Anderson, who ended his record-breaking career following the huge win in the first Test at Lord’s. Wood missed the first Test after being part of the England squad for the T20 World Cup in June. The 34-year-old has taken 108 wickets in 34 Tests and will form a pacey pairing alongside Gus Atkinson, with Chris Woakes the other specialist seamer. England XI for second Test: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (capt) Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Mark Wood, Shoaib Bashir. England expect Windies response - Crawley Pope on captaincy, batting at three and white-ball aspirations Matthew Potts and the uncapped Dillon Pennington again sit out, having being part of the squad for the first Test at Lord’s. In Pennington’s case, the Nottinghamshire bowler misses the chance to make a Test debut on his home ground. England, 1-0 up, can win the series at Trent Bridge and thus earn their first Test series win since the tour of Pakistan in 2022. There are likely to be further changes to the pace-bowling attack for the third Test at Edgbaston next week, given the congested nature of the series. Woakes, 35, wins his 50th cap and assumes the role of attack leader now Anderson has followed long-term new-ball partner Stuart Broad into retirement. Indeed, this will be England's first home Test without at least one of Anderson or Broad in their side since 2012. Surrey’s Atkinson, 26, took match figures of 12-106 at Lord’s, the fourth-best by a bowler on Test debut in the history of the game. West Indies are waiting on the fitness of pace bowler Shamar Joseph after he struggled with a left hamstring injury at Lord’s. The 24-year-old bowled in the nets at Trent Bridge on Tuesday and is not thought to be a doubt at this stage.

459,'Southgate deserves respect but was not the winner England wanted',"Gareth Southgate leaves England with a managerial record of played 102, won 61, drawn 24, lost 17 - a 59.8% win rate Gareth Southgate’s eight years as England manager will be judged as an age of progress in many areas, but ultimately one of falling agonisingly short when it came to claiming the big prizes. Southgate leaves following the Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain, with a better record than anyone in the job since 1966 World Cup winner Sir Alf Ramsey, deserving total respect for the manner in which he handled the unique pressures of being England manager. And England’s consistent appearances in the latter stages of major tournaments was a sharp contrast to the fallow years of embarrassing exits under predecessors Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson - the one-match reign of Sam Allardyce being the Football Association’s “blink and you missed it” moment. This is why Southgate can leave with his head held high, and able to reflect on a fine body of work that restored England as a serious proposition on the global stage. There is no escape, however, from the brutal reality that when measured against the opportunities which presented themselves in four major tournaments, along with the talent at his disposal, Southgate could not lead England over the line. It may be a harsh judgement to regard Southgate as a nearly England manager leading a nearly England team, but that running theme of close, but not close enough leaves him open to those charges. Legacies are shaped by such fine margins. If England had beaten Spain in Berlin to win their first major men’s trophy for 58 years, Southgate would have been transformed from a maligned figure - facing hostility and flying beer cups in Cologne after England failed to beat Slovenia in the group stage - to a national hero and sporting icon. Instead, Southgate’s record of near misses meant England and the Football Association could not find the managerial winner they have craved since 1966. All the reaction after Southgate quits as England manager  Southgate resigns after England's Euro 2024 loss Best since Ramsey? How does Southgate's record compare? Southgate’s peak of popularity arguably came between 2018 and 2021 when he led England to a surprise World Cup semi-final against Croatia in Moscow and then a  Euros final against Italy at Wembley - but both were lost from winning positions, the manner of those defeats used as prime examples of the occasional tactical inertia and conservatism that provided a regular backdrop to his regime. He placed England back to what had become alien territory in the previous decade of the latter stages of major tournaments, but was still treated with scepticism in some quarters. The latest gallant loss to Spain in Berlin’s Olympiastadion means Southgate could not pull off the history-making triumph that would change those minds. In the wider context, Southgate was a calm, measured personality who achieved the not inconsiderable feat of making a nation fall in love with its football team once more, leading with dignity on and off the field, demonstrating a willingness to tackle thorny subjects away from the playing arena with his measured words on racism and other issues. The modern England manager must have a wider hinterland than simply football as all issues are now seen as fair game for his views. Southgate possesses it, serving him and the Football Association well when the game’s waves spread beyond the pitch. Southgate was the subject of a successful West End production Dear England, the title taken from an open letter he wrote to England’s fans before Euro 2020. A post-Germany plot revision of the piece will not have the happy ending writer James Graham hoped for, as Southgate’s England could not deliver the winning storyline against Spain. The relationship between Southgate and England fans was sometimes uneasy, as seen in those angry scenes against Slovenia, but such is the fickle nature of that volatile union that he was dancing in front of those same supporters receiving raucous acclaim after Switzerland were beaten on penalties. He was serenaded by supporters during those heady days between 2018 and 2021, then singled out for fierce criticism when the expectations he helped to raise were not fulfilled, such is the precarious existence of England’s manager. Southgate suffered personal abuse from supporters that made him question his future before and after the Qatar World Cup in 2022. But the 53-year-old’s time in charge must always be viewed through the prism of what he inherited when England’s former under-21 manager agreed a four-year contract in November 2016. The FA was in chaos following Sam Allardyce’s one-game reign in succession to the humiliated Roy Hodgson, who presided over the national embarrassment of defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016. England’s direction of travel was a rapid downhill spiral after the failures of predecessors Capello and Hodgson. Southgate privately distanced himself from succeeding Hodgson before accepting a four-year contract to take over after the turbulent 67 days of Allardyce. Mature and civilised, Southgate rarely lost his composure and was at ease under the fierce scrutiny accompanying his status, England’s new manager quickly embarking on a period of culture change Southgate delivered an opening mission statement insisting England had to “get off the island” and learn from elsewhere, particularly the German model of strong connections between the DFB (German football association) and the domestic Bundesliga. Gareth Southgate was England Under-21 manager before taking the senior role Southgate’s first game in permanent charge - after four as interim manager - was a 1-0 friendly loss to Germany in Dortmund in March 2017. He gave new caps to defender Michael Keane and midfielders Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse on the start of a journey to England’s first World Cup semi-final since 1990 in Moscow the following summer. From the angst and discontent of the debacle at Euro 2016 in France under Hodgson, Southgate’s more collegiate and open approach changed the mood instantly. Capello's fierce, brusque style and the rigid repetition of Hodgson’s methods were out. Southgate’s modern outlook was in. England’s players felt the weight of the shirt, so often referred to as an impossible burden by Capello, lifted. They were happy to represent their country again. As his England renewal took shape, those who played for Southgate admired and respected him as someone who was loyal, who backed those players who produced for him, and would be prepared to act as a willing shield for them when the criticism, as it invariably does, started to fly. Who will be next England manager? How much do you know about Southgate's time as England boss? 'Thank you Gareth - you gave a nation new memories' He showed private and public support for Harry Maguire, a key figure in England’s renaissance, who became a figure of mockery for his own and opposition supporters. It was seen with his loyalty to Kalvin Phillips, who was a central figure in the Euro 2020 finals but fell from grace spectacularly after moving to Manchester City, and then West Ham United on loan. He was only excluded when Southgate could no longer justify his inclusion. Southgate was at the forefront on a shameful night in Sofia in October 2019, when a Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria, which England won 6-0, was stopped twice after Tyrone Mings and Raheem Sterling were targeted for vicious racist abuse. And those of us who witnessed Southgate dealing with hostile Bulgarian questioning, with some locals denying there was a problem, could not fail to be hugely impressed. Southgate made his point while always issuing the caution that England had problems of its own in this regard and must not believe it was something that only existed elsewhere. It was the reaction of a serious, decent person who saw his role at the FA as more than just the manager of the senior football team. Southgate was put in temporary charge of the senior England team on 27 September 2016 He had already made his mark before taking the job permanently, showing the hidden steel that lurked beneath the smooth exterior, by effectively ending the England career of then all-time leading goalscorer and captain Wayne Rooney by dropping him for a World Cup qualifier in Slovenia. Rooney only figured three more times as he was eased aside, the last a ceremonial farewell in a friendly against Scotland. For a manager incorrectly tagged as “too nice” to take tough decisions, Southgate never shied away. It was seen when Sterling’s international career was brought to an abrupt close after the 2022 World Cup, then when Ben Chilwell, Jack Grealish, Jordan Henderson and James Maddison were cut from the Euro 2024 squad. The media, kept at arm’s length and operating under an apparent “give them nothing” restriction at Euro 2016, were welcomed into England’s Russian World Cup base two years later. They were even invited to play darts against Southgate’s squad, a tradition that was maintained here in Germany, along with a football match between the media and England’s backroom staff, managed by Kieran Trippier. Even the sight of Southgate with his arm in a sling after dislocating his shoulder, after falling over while out running, was only a bump in the road as England were a surprise package, reaching the semi-final only to lose to Croatia in extra time after taking an early lead through Trippier’s free-kick. England lost control of a game they had in their grasp. It was a flaw they displayed too often in the big moments under Southgate and led to doubts about his game management and tactical flexibility against high-class opposition. The unlikely nature of England’s campaign made Southgate and his squad hugely popular, the manager’s trademark waistcoat transforming him into something of a fashion icon. Southgate dropped England captain Wayne Rooney in his second game in charge, giving him 17 minutes off the bench in a 0-0 draw in Slovenia If there was one game in Southgate’s reign that summed up where the fault lines lay, it was the great missed opportunity of the Euro 2020 final against Italy at Wembley. This will surely be the game of biggest single regret, even ahead of Sunday’s loss in Berlin. England were effectively presented with a home tournament, just one game being played away from Wembley in Rome, where Ukraine were thrashed 4-0 in the quarter-final. After Denmark were beaten in the semi-final, England once again went ahead through Luke Shaw after two minutes but, as against Croatia and in a familiar pattern under Southgate, they went into retreat, allowing an Italy side that was hardly vintage to dominate, equalise then take the final to penalties. England allowed matters to drift - Southgate waiting until extra time to introduce Grealish - then the later stages to bring on Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, who barely had any time to get attuned to the occasion, then missing penalties in the shootout England lost. England’s painful loss was the final straw on a dreadful day marred by fan disorder, with ugly scenes inside and outside Wembley. What could have been a golden day for Southgate, a defining moment for manager and players, was a nightmare as the shadow of racism hung over the aftermath when Rashford, Sancho and Bukayo Saka were shamefully abused after missing penalties in the shootout. By the time the following summer rolled around, the first signs that Southgate was falling from favour with a once-adoring public could be seen and heard. Southgate may have sensed it himself as he talked of “not outstaying my welcome” before a Nations League meeting with Hungary at Molineux. If he had not, he soon got the message as he was subjected to personal abuse after a 4-0 loss, with chants also echoing around the stadium. It had a profound effect on a manager who saw strength in unity - management, players and supporters - and was always aware of the danger of him becoming a divisive figure. Once again, this was a recurring theme. Southgate took the England men's team to a first major final since 1966, losing Euro 2020 on penalties to Italy at Wembley Southgate considered leaving once more after the World Cup quarter-final loss to France in Qatar. Indeed many inside the FA were quietly convinced the search for a new manager would soon be an item on their agenda. The sympathetic and positive response to England’s efforts in Qatar shaped his decision to stay, with a contract signed to take him through Euro 2024 to November. In Germany, there had been an “end of days” feel to a flat, disjointed campaign, with Southgate losing touch on tactics and feeling fan hostility again. Southgate, normally so assured when faced with the awkward, searching questions, found his voice faltering when asked about the abuse, which played into all his fears about becoming someone who would split supporters and his team. He took bold decisions to include youngsters Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton in England’s squad but did not appear to have a clear midfield plan, describing his flawed strategy to play Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold in the middle as an experiment. Southgate also received criticism from outside for name-checking Kalvin Phillips as a key absentee, but this was unjust. He, in fact, stated England were missing a Phillips-type reliable, physical holding player, not Phillips himself. He was presented with a generational talent in Jude Bellingham, alongside Premier League Player of the Season Phil Foden and England’s all-time record scorer Harry Kane, who looked so out of sorts in Germany - but struggled in vain to reach a formula, a manager seemingly running out of inspiration. Gareth Southgate had simply run out of road as England manager. He could not take England to a place they have craved since 1966 – but Southgate leaves with them in a much better place than when he arrived, and with a record that makes him the country’s second greatest manager since Ramsey.",2024-07-16 23:09:40,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c886pl8v9j8o,Phil McNulty,2024-07-16 23:09:40,

458,'Easily one of the best' - Bellingham leads Southgate tributes,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Gareth Southgate's England journey Jude Bellingham praised Gareth Southgate as ""easily one of the best coaches in the history of the national team"" in a heartfelt tribute to the outgoing England manager. Southgate resigned on Tuesday after nearly eight years in the role, with England's 2-1 loss to Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final his last match in charge. In a post on Instagram, Real Madrid midfielder Bellingham described Southgate as ""an unbelievable human being"". ""I'd like to thank Gareth and his staff for the great memories during his tenure,"" Bellingham wrote. ""From the point of view of a fan who has become a member of the squad, it's been a rollercoaster of amazing emotions that has instilled hope and joy back into our country. ""It was a privilege being lead by someone who is so dedicated and passionate, not only is Gareth easily one of the best coaches in the history of the national team but also an unbelievable human being. ""Thank you for everything and all the best in the next chapter, Gaffer."" BBC Sport pundit and former England striker Alan Shearer was also among those to pay tribute to Southgate, who took charge of 102 games and led his country to back-to-back Euros finals. ""It was a huge job for him [Southgate] to take on,"" Shearer told the BBC. ""He did that and turned everything around, we went from rock bottom to playing in semi-finals and finals. That is now the expectation with England and he played a huge part in that."" He added that the 53-year-old will be remembered for ""creating this incredible spirit and for players again wanting to represent their country"". Southgate resigns after England's Euro 2024 loss Who will be next England manager? How does Southgate's England manager record compare? Gary Lineker expressed his thanks to Southgate on X. The BBC presenter and ex-England striker wrote: ""Wishing Gareth Southgate all the very best in the future. He brought pride, respect and a togetherness to England that we hadn't seen for a long time. ""He was close, very close to footballing immortality and he always did the job with humility, decency and dignity. Thank you, Gareth."" A number of current England stars also paid tribute to Southgate on social media. Among them was captain Harry Kane, who was appointed as skipper by Southgate ahead of the 2018 World Cup. ""Boss. Thank you for everything you have done for me and our country!"" the Bayern Munich striker wrote on X. ""You have been one of England's greatest ever managers and it has been a pleasure to have served as your captain throughout. ""You helped our nation connect and believe in our team again. There have been so many highlights and we've made memories together that will last forever!"" Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice wrote on Instagram: ""Thank you gaffer. It's been a privilege to play for England under your guidance. ""Memories that will stay with me forever. All the best in your next adventure."" Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, also on Instagram, added: ""I also want to say a special thank you to the boss for always believing in me during his time with us and I would like to wish him all the best in his next steps. Thank you Gareth."" Harry Maguire missed out on selection for Euro 2024 because of a calf injury, but the centre-back played a key role in previous tournaments under Southgate. ""You made us all believe again - memories that will last forever. Thank you boss,"" the Manchester United defender wrote on Instagram. Sarina Wiegman, who has been Southgate's counterpart with the England women's team for the past three years, said she was sad to see him go. ""He is such a nice person and a great coach,"" she told ITV. ""We wouldn't see each other all the time but when we would see each other it was very nice. ""What he has done for England football is really incredible. He can be very proud of himself. England is very proud of him and I'm Dutch, I am very proud of him too."" Former England international Ashley Young won 39 caps for his country and was the first choice left-back for the Three Lions during their run to the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup. Young told BBC Sport: ""If you talk to many players who played in previous eras, what Gareth did and the way he brought the players and staff together, the players started to enjoy going away on national team duty. ""You only need to look at what he has done for the country. For me, he has done a great job for English football and disappointing to see he has resigned. ""Of course, he would have wanted to achieve and win something and the teams definitely deserved to do that. He can walk away with his held high, he brought the nation back together. Players and staff, the way he gelled everyone together was incredible."" Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former Club England managing director Adrian Bevington said: ""This is a man who is a great leader of people, he's an inspirational person. ""He's is a very hard act to follow. It's a very tough task for the Football Association. Finding the right replacement is the very hard part here, they've got to decide first of all on the profile of the individual coach they want. ""It's really important this person can also handle off-field responsibilities, too. ""You are in effect adopting a stance of being like a prime ministerial type figure because of all the issues you have to contend with.

474,JD Vance was once 'never Trump'. Now he's his running mate,"“I’m a ‘never Trump’ guy. I never liked him.” “My god what an idiot.” “I find him reprehensible.” That was from JD Vance in interviews and on Twitter in 2016, when the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy catapulted him to fame. In the same year, he wrote privately on Facebook to Josh McLaurin, his former law school roommate, now a state Senator in Georgia: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole... or that he's America's Hitler"". 'To go from those texts... to being Trump's biggest cheerleader, it's just kind of unbelievable,"" Mr McLaurin, who is a member of the Democratic Party, told BBC Newshour. A few short years later, Mr Vance transformed himself into one of Trump’s steadfast allies. The first-term senator from Ohio is now by Trump’s side as vice-presidential running mate – and, by extension, an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 – with a reliably conservative voting record and Midwestern roots that Republicans hope will boost support at the ballot box. In fact, Mr Vance has made something of a habit of transformation. How did he emerge from a tough upbringing to reach the highest levels of American politics? Mr McLaurin told BBC Newshour that his former roommate previously felt like the Republican party needed to give working people hope as well as economic opportunities. If unsuccessful in doing so, Mr Vance believed a ""demagogue"" would fill that vacancy, he said.  According to Mr McLaurin, Mr Vance saw Trump as the demagogue.  When asked why Mr Vance has changed his stance on Trump, Mr McLaurin said he thinks it has to do with a ""deep-seated anger"". ""There’s this joke that men would rather run for office than go to therapy and I think that’s probably especially true in his case,"" he said.  Mr Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Mr Vance was adopted by his stepfather when he was six years old. He dropped his middle and last names - changing Donald, his biological father's name, to David, which preserved his nickname of JD. His last name changed from Bowman to Hamel, his stepfather's last name.  His mother split from his then-stepfather a few years later.  When he married after graduating law school, the couple took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance.  Although Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, Mr Vance identified closely with his family’s roots slightly to the south in Appalachia, the vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest. It includes some of the country’s poorest areas. Mr Vance painted an honest portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of his family members and friends. And his book also took a decidedly conservative view – describing them as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on welfare payments and mostly failing to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”. “The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.” While he poured scorn on ""elites"" and exclusive society, he painted himself as a counterpoint to the chronic failure of those he grew up with. By the time the book came out, Mr Vance’s own bootstrap tugging had slung him far away from Middletown: first to the US Marines and a tour of duty in Iraq, and later to Ohio State University, Yale Law School and a job as a venture capitalist in California. Hillbilly Elegy made him not only into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white, working-class voters.  He rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee. “I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016.  ""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.”   In 2017 Mr Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, whom he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. As the child of Indian immigrants who grew up in San Diego, Usha Vance has a very different background from her husband. She also attended Yale as an undergraduate and received a masters degree from University of Cambridge. She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after law school and is currently a litigator. Mr Vance's name was long whispered about as a political candidate, and he saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, he got a kick-start via a $10m  (£7.7m) donation by his former boss, Silicon Valley power broker Peter Thiel. But the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected in increasingly Republican Ohio was his past criticism of Trump. He apologised for his previous remarks and managed to mend fences and earn Trump’s endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate. In the process, Mr Vance has become an increasingly important player in the world of Make America Great Again politics – and has signed up almost completely to Trump’s agenda.   In the Senate he has been a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine. Given his short tenure in the Democrat-led chamber, the bills he has sponsored have rarely moved forward, and have more often been about sending messages than changing policy. In recent months, Mr Vance introduced bills to withhold federal funds for colleges where there are encampments or protests against Israel's war in Gaza, and to colleges that employ undocumented immigrants. Mr Vance also sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government off from US capital markets if it does not follow international trade law. He hit all of these themes at a recent speech at the National Conservatism Conference, where he declared: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."" He said the idea of the American Dream – ""This very basic idea that you should be able to build a good life for yourself and your family in the country you call home"" - was ""under siege by the left"". And he said that American involvement in Ukraine had ""no obvious conclusion or even objective that we’re close to getting accomplished"". Also at the conference, he said the UK was ""not doing so good"" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country had become the “first truly Islamist country” with a nuclear bomb. Mr Vance, who was baptised as a Catholic in 2019, has expressed support in the past for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks. But he recently backed Trump's view that the matter was for states to decide. When his Hitler comment was first reported, in 2022, a spokesperson did not dispute it, but said it no longer represented his views. Mr Vance received waves of loud applause when he entered the convention arena in Milwaukee on Monday. He walked over to the Ohio contingent and, looking somewhat in awe of the scene, took selfies with delegates as he was being introduced. ""He's from humble beginnings and he's young,"" said delegate Amanda Suffecool, the party's chair in Portage County, in north-east Ohio. ""A lot of people are going to think he looks like him."" Mr Vance was also one of the first top Republicans to point the finger at Democrat campaign rhetoric in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally on Saturday. ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,"" he posted on X hours after the shooting. ""That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination."" In comments on Monday, President Biden called Mr Vance a ""clone of Trump"" - indicating how Democrats will attempt to portray him for the rest of the campaign.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-16 23:11:08,

Karine Jean-Pierre, his press secretary, said the US president is vaccinated and boosted.  He has tested positive for Covid twice before.  Mr Biden, 81, was seen earlier on Wednesday visiting supporters in Las Vegas and speaking at an event. He has cancelled a campaign speech later in the night. The illness comes as he faces increasing pressure to step aside because of his age following a poor debate performance at the end of June.  Ms Jean-Pierre said the president planned to isolate at his home in Delaware while he carries out ""all of his duties fully during that time"".  The president's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, said Mr Biden presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and a cough and was given his first dose of Paxlovid.  He felt fine during his first event of the day, but later tested positive Dr O'Connor said. Reporters on the Las Vegas trip said they were rushed to the city's airport following the announcement. Mr Biden moved slowly and cautiously up the steps to the plane, video shows. He was not wearing a mask. The president was forced to cancel a speech at UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation. The organisation's chief executive Janet Murguría confirmed the diagnosis to the audience. ""Thank you all so much for your patience and understanding,"" she told the crowd.  ""Regrettably I was just on the phone with President Biden. And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events as we all know and he just tested positive for Covid."" The illness comes as Mr Biden faces increased calls for him to withdraw from the face.  Nearly two dozen Democratic politicians have called for him to step aside in recent weeks, including Adam Schiff, a congressman from California,, who said today he had serious doubts about whether the president could beat former President Donald Trump.  He called on Mr Biden to  ""pass the torch"". Mr Schiff said that Mr Biden ""has been one of the most consequential presidents in our nation’s history"", and he could ""secure his legacy of leadership"" by allowing another Democrat to step forward.  In an interview with BET, which was due to be broadcast on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said he did not feel he could pass the mantle with the country so ""divided"".  The president also said, for the first time, that he would consider dropping out of the race if any of his doctors said he had a ""medical condition"".

A post from the verified Instagram account of Sheikha Mahra bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said she was ending her marriage, and reads: ""I hereby declare our divorce."" The BBC has reached out to officials in the country to seek clarity on the matter. There has been no public comment from Sheikha Mahra's husband, Sheikh Mana bin Mohammed bin Rashid bin Mana Al Maktoum, or her father. The post, which begins ""Dear Husband"", concluded - ""I divorce you, I divorce you, and I divorce you,"" seemingly using the Islamic practice known as triple talaq. The practice has been banned in many countries, but usually allows husbands to swiftly divorce their wives by saying ""I divorce you"" three times. ""Take care. Your ex-wife,"" the post on Instagram added. All images of Sheikha Mahra's husband appear to have been deleted from her account. Sheikh Mana's account likewise seems stripped of pictures of his wife.  The couple married in April 2023 in a lavish ceremony, and their first child was born two months ago. Some comments from Instagram users have speculated that Sheikha Mahra's account could have been hacked. There has been no official indication of this. At time of publication, the post declaring her divorce was listed as one day old. Dubai's government and the UAE Embassy in London did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

471,Ex-CIA analyst charged with spying for South Korea,"A New York grand jury has indicted a former US Central Intelligence Agency analyst on charges of acting as a spy for the South Korean government in exchange for luxury goods, bags and fancy meals.  Sue Mi Terry, who previously worked as a senior official for the White House National Security Council, faces two counts of failing to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  Federal officials say Ms Terry - a prominent US expert on North Korea - acted as an agent for the South Korean government for over a decade, but she did not register as a foreign agent with American officials, according to court documents made public on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York. The Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank where Ms Terry works as a senior fellow on Asia, has placed her on unpaid leave, a spokesperson told US outlets. The organisation has also removed her biography from its website.  Ms Terry, 54, denies the charges and her attorney, Lee Wolosky, told the BBC the allegations against her were ""unfounded"". The charges ""distort the work of a scholar and news analyst known for her independence and years of service to the United States"", Mr Wolosky said. ""In fact, she was a harsh critic of the South Korean government during times this indictment alleges that she was acting on its behalf."" Born in South Korea, Ms Terry moved to the US at age 12, according to her previous employer at Columbia University.  In 2001, she earned her doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, a prominent international relations school in Massachusetts. She is known to lecture in English and Korean. Ms Terry, 54, then went on to work as a senior analyst for the CIA from 2001 to 2008, before holding a variety of posts in the federal government, including as Director for Korea, Japan, and Oceanic Affairs at the National Security Council during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations.  Prosecutors say Ms Terry's work as an agent for the South Korean government began in 2013, about five years, after she stopped working for the CIA and the National Security Council.  In the 31-page indictment, officials say Ms Terry admitted to FBI agents in a voluntary interview in 2023 that she was a “source” for South Korea’s National Intelligence Service.  The indictment alleges that the South Korean government gifted Ms Terry a $2,845 (£2,100) Dolce & Gabbana coat, a $3,450 Louis Vuitton handbag and meals at upscale restaurants. Officials say the government also gave her $37,000 and came up with a plan to hide the source of the funds, ultimately placing them in a gift fund at the think tank where she worked.  Ms Terry's indictment comes just a day after Democratic Senator Robert Menendez was convicted of helping foreign governments in exchange for luxury items including gold bars and a Mercedes car.

469,Cyanide found in blood of Bangkok hotel victims,"Cyanide has been found in the blood of all six people who died in a luxury hotel suite in Bangkok, say doctors after examining their bodies. Based on the initial post-mortem examination, they say there is ""no other cause"" that would explain their deaths ""except for cyanide"".  But further tests are being carried out to determine the ""intensity"" of the deadly chemical and to rule out any other toxins. Forensic investigators had earlier found traces of cyanide on the teacups used by the victims, all of whom are of Vietnamese origin including two with dual US citizenship. Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt - but have not said who. The victims' lips and nails had turned dark purple indicating a lack of oxygen, while their internal organs turned ""blood red"", which is another sign of cyanide poisoning, said Professor Kornkiat Vongpaisarnsin of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Chulalongkorn University. Doctor Chanchai Sittipunt, the dean of the Faculty of Medicine, said they still needed to find out how much cyanide was in the blood of the deceased. ""But from what we have detected - from observation, from internal organ check, from finding cyanide in the blood during the screening test - there is no other cause that would be the factor that would cause their deaths, except for cyanide,” he told reporters. The deceased were found by housekeepers at the Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel in the Thai capital late on Tuesday. Investigators believe they had been dead for between 12 and 24 hours by then.  The mystery around the shocking discovery made international headlines.  Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin ordered an urgent investigation into the case, stressing that the deaths were the result of a ""private matter"", and there was no suggestion of public danger.  Police have since begun to piece together what might have happened.  Two of the six victims had loaned ""tens of millions of Thai baht"" to another of the deceased for investment purposes, authorities said. Ten million baht is worth nearly $280,000 (£215,000). Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Bangkok police chief Gen Noppassin Poonsawat told a press conference the group checked into the hotel separately over the weekend and were assigned five rooms - four on the seventh floor, and one on the fifth.  They had been scheduled to check out on Monday but failed to do so. Four of the victims are Vietnamese nationals Thi Nguyen Phuong, 46, her husband Hong Pham Thanh, 49, Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, 47,  and Dinh Tran Phu, 37. The other two are American citizens Sherine Chong, 56, and Dang Hung Van, 55. The US state department has offered its condolences and said it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting Thai authorities in the investigation, Mr Srettha said. The motive is not clear, but police said two of the six had loaned a substantial amount of money to another person in the group, who had not been paid back. Police say on Monday afternoon all six victims gathered in the room on the fifth floor.  The group ordered food and tea, which was delivered to the room around 14:00 local time (08:00 BST) and received by Ms Chong - who was the only person in the room at the time.  According to the deputy police chief, a waiter offered to make tea for the guests but Ms Chong refused this. The waiter recalled that she “spoke very little and was visibly under stress”, authorities said. The waiter later left the room.  The rest of the group then began streaming into the room at various points, between 14:03 and 14:17. No one else is believed to have entered the room apart from the six inside and police have said the door to the room was locked from within.   Police say there were no signs of a struggle, robbery or forced entry. They later found traces of cyanide in all six tea cups. Pictures released by the police show plates of untouched food left on a table in the room, some of them still covered in cling wrap.  There was a seventh name on the group's hotel booking, whom police identified as the younger sister of one of the victims. She had left Thailand last week for the Vietnamese coastal city of Da Nang and is not involved in the incident, police said.  Relatives interviewed by the police said Thi Nguyen Phuong and Hong Pham Thanh, a couple, owned a road construction business and had given money to Ms Chong to invest in a hospital building project in Japan. Police suspect that Mr Tran, a make-up artist based in Da Nang, had also been “duped"" into making an investment.  Mr Tran's mother Tuý told BBC Vietnamese that he had travelled to Thailand on Friday and had called home on Sunday to say he had to extend his stay until Monday. That was the last his family had heard from him. She rang him again on Monday but he did not answer the call.  Ms Chong had hired Mr Tran as her personal make-up artist for the trip, one of his students told BBC Vietnamese. Mr Tran's father, Phu, told Vietnamese media that his son was hired last week by a Vietnamese woman to travel to Thailand.   The six bodies were discovered one day after Thailand expanded its visa-free entry scheme to travellers from 93 countries and territories to revitalise its tourism industry.  Cyanide is a rapidly-acting, highly toxic chemical that is potentially deadly. Low levels of cyanide occur in nature and in products we eat and use. But in larger doses it is a notorious poison, and has been used as a chemical warfare agent because of its fast-acting and highly lethal properties. It can occur as a colourless gas or liquid or in crystal form. People can be exposed to cyanide by breathing it in, absorbing it through the skin, or eating food or liquids that contain it. When consumed in large amounts, cyanide can lead to lung injury, coma and death within seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even in smaller doses, cyanide is still very harmful, causing chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath and vomiting. Cyanide can produce a “bitter almond” smell but not everyone can detect this and it doesn’t always give off an odour.

465,Chance to reset UK-European relations at summit,"Sir Keir Starmer will host around 45 European leaders on Thursday at a summit he hopes will begin to reset Britain’s relationship with the continent. The gathering of the European Political Community (EPC) will give leaders a chance to reaffirm support for Ukraine and discuss key shared concerns such as migration and energy. The summit at Blenheim Palace near Oxford will also allow the prime minister an early opportunity to meet scores of European allies only weeks into his premiership. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir promised the UK would have a “more active and greater convening role on the world stage”. He added: “The EPC will fire the starting gun on this government’s new approach to Europe, one that will not just benefit us now, but for generations to come, from dismantling the people-smuggling webs trafficking people across Europe, to standing up to Putin’s barbaric actions in Ukraine and destabilising activity across Europe.""  There will be greater European efforts to tackle people-smuggling gangs, and faster asylum decisions, with 100 Home Office staff redeployed to help return failed claimants to their country of origin. The EPC was set up in 2022 in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a way of bringing together European heads of government - from both the EU and outside - for informal talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend the gathering only a week after Nato leaders promised his country more air defences, but no invitation to join the military alliance. Lord Ricketts, former national security adviser, said the summit would help “put Britain back at the centre of European diplomacy” although most discussions would be about the war in Ukraine. “The main headline will be European leaders coming together to show united support for Ukraine and Zelensky at a time of political uncertainty in the United States,"" he said. The summit will also give the prime minister the chance to set out to EU leaders his hopes of agreeing a new security and defence pact with the bloc. He will be accompanied by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, minister for EU relations Nick Thomas-Symonds and Europe minister Stephen Doughty. But any EU-focused discussions will not involve the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, because the hearing and vote confirming her expected reappointment takes place in Strasbourg on the same day. Sir Keir is due to hold separate face-to-face meetings with the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and then French President Emmanuel Macron at a private dinner at Blenheim. Labour’s manifesto promised to make the UK “a leading nation in Europe once again, with an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners”. EU officials say they would be happy to discuss closer security cooperation, but say detailed negotiations are the future. They warn EU members may demand concessions from the UK in return on issues like fishing rights and youth mobility. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said the summit will allow Sir Keir to “hobnob and establish human connections” with European leaders he has never met. It will also give the PM a chance “to set out the direction and scope” of how he wants to reset UK-EU relations. “Keir Starmer’s personality in itself will do more than people realise,” Mr Grant said. “He is diligent, sensible, serious, he reads his briefs, he believes in the rule of law and international institutions. The Europeans will like that.” Also invited to the EPC – for the first time – are the general secretaries of Nato, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss what Downing Street calls the “arc of conflict and instability inside and near Europe’s borders”. The formal summit agenda involves separate discussions on tackling illegal migration and people trafficking, beefing up Europe’s energy security, and defending democracy and countering disinformation. The prime minister will attend the migration working group, co-chaired by Italy’s right wing leader, Georgia Meloni. In informal bilateral talks on the margins of the summit, leaders are also expected to discuss how best to prepare Europe for a possible Donald Trump presidency, with the risk of a global trade war and declining US military support for Ukraine. The prime minister said that “Europe is at the forefront of some of the greatest challenges of our time.""  “Russia’s barbaric war continues to reverberate across our continent, while vile smuggling gangs traffic innocent people on perilous journeys that too often end in tragedy,"" he said.  “We cannot be spectators in this chapter of history. We must do more and go further, not just for the courageous Ukrainians on the frontlines, or those being trafficked from country-to-country, but so our future generations look back with pride at what our continent achieved together.” He said that he promised to ""change the way the UK engages with our European partners, working collaboratively to drive forward progress on these generational challenges"", adding that work begins at the summit. This is only the fourth meeting of the EPC, the brainchild of President Macron. The previous biannual summits were held in the Czech Republic in 2022, and then Moldova and Spain last year. The next country to host the EPC later this year is Hungary whose leader, Viktor Orban, is close to Vladimir Putin and resists Nato support for Ukraine. There are questions about how much the diplomatic format can achieve. It has no secretariat, it takes no decisions, it agrees no communiques. Critics say it is little more than a talking shop. They also say the membership is so large that a shared agenda, let alone agreement, is hard to reach. But supporters say the informal discussions without framework give heads of government a rare chance to talk and work through problems. They also say it is one of the few bodies that brings together EU and non-EU countries. Blenheim Palace was chosen as a venue in part because of its symbolism as the birthplace of Winston Churchill, who in 1946 called for “a kind of United States of Europe…a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom”. However, the leaders will walk through grand corridors with paintings reminding them the Baroque mansion was named after a great battle of European powers in 1704 that saw Britain and Austria defeat French and Bavarian forces.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxqlz8l8plo,"James Landale,",2024-07-17 22:11:08,
467,Three things to watch for in JD Vance's convention speech,"Ohio Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump's newly minted running mate, will make his national debut on Wednesday as he delivers a prime-time address on the third day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.  At 39, the junior senator and former venture capitalist is the first millennial to join a major party ticket, a youthful contrast to the 78-year-old Trump and the 81-year-old incumbent president, Joe Biden. As Trump's running mate, Mr Vance is an early favourite for the party's 2028 Republican presidential nomination, but he remains politically unknown to most Americans and many in the party.  Donald Trump Jr, the former president's son and a close friend of Mr Vance, is expected to speak before Mr Vance's wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, introduces the Republican vice-presidential nominee.  As Mr Vance steps into the national spotlight, here are three things to look out for in his speech.  Mr Vance is expected to highlight his blue-collar background and his family roots in Appalachia as well as Middletown, Ohio, which inspired him to write his 2016 bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.  The book - which focuses on his impoverished upbringing with a drug-addicted mother in southern Ohio, enlisting as a US Marine and later attending Yale Law School - was published as Trump was elected to the White House. Later adapted into an Oscar-nominated film, it was upheld as a glimpse into understanding the white working-class voters that helped fuel Trump's rise.  Republicans are hoping Mr Vance's background will appeal to those voters, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three battleground states that were key to Trump's 2016 coalition and will be critical for a White House victory in November.  Mr Vance is also expected to highlight his military background. The former Marine, who was deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005, is the first veteran - and the first post-9/11 veteran - to be named to a major party ticket since John McCain in 2008.  Mr Vance's debut follows appearances by former Trump rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, who offered their full support for the former president on Tuesday after challenging his candidacy during the Republican primary.  Republicans have sought to close ranks around Trump while Democrats remain divided over whether to proceed with President Biden at the top of their ticket.  The Ohio senator is expected to strike a similar tone of unity, which Trump has said would be an underlying theme of the convention in the wake of an attempt on his life at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Authorities have yet to determine the motive of the attacker, who was killed at the scene.  In the hours after the shooting, Mr Vance laid blame on President Biden as the country was still learning about the events that unfolded.  ""Today is not just some isolated incident,"" Mr Vance wrote on the platform X, formerly Twitter.  ""The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.""  Former Republican Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a vocal critic of Trump who has endorsed Joe Biden, said Mr Vance's response ""should absolutely disqualify"" him from the vice-presidential nomination.  Mr Vance is expected to emphasise the message of national unity that his running mate has promised, but so far speakers at the convention have continued heated attacks on the Biden administration and Democrats.  Wednesday's convention theme, ""Make America Strong Once Again,"" is expected to focus on US foreign policy, highlighting the former president's ""America First"" isolationist policies that reshaped US relationships on the world stage.  Mr Vance has been sharply critical of the Biden administration's foreign policy on issues including the US withdrawal in Afghanistan, the Israel-Gaza war, southern border security and support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The nomination of Mr Vance has stoked fears in Europe over the implications of a second Trump presidency for both the Nato alliance and continued US military and financial aid for Ukraine.  The Ohio senator told the Munich Security Conference in February that European countries needed to shoulder a bigger burden so the US could pivot to East Asia against a rising China.  He played a key role in delaying the $60bn (£46bn) military aid package from Washington earlier this year and has suggested that Ukraine should broker a peace deal with Russia, even if that means giving up territory.  But the Republican party remains divided over support for Ukraine and it's unclear if Mr Vance's scepticism of Ukraine aid will influence Trump.  Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, traveled to Milwaukee on Tuesday to meet with Trump on continued aid. Following the meeting, he posted on X that he had ""no doubt that [Trump] will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy"". Concerns about a second Trump presidency rattled stock markets after Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek that Taiwan should have to pay for its own defense.  In response to a question on whether he would defend Taiwan against China, which sees the self-governing island as a breakaway province, the former president said: ""You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.""  He also said Taiwan, which is critical to the global chipmaking industry, ""took 100% of our chip industry"", sending semiconductor stocks tumbling on Wednesday.

466,Ursula von der Leyen faces crunch vote on top Europe job,"Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) decide on Thursday whether to hand Ursula von der Leyen a second term as European Commission president. Despite Ms von der Leyen’s recent efforts to shore up support, the outcome of the vote – due to take place at the European Parliament in Brussels at 13:00 (11:00 GMT) – is far from certain. European leaders officially nominated Ms von der Leyen at a summit in Brussels at the end of June. The decision came despite resistance from Italy’s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, who abstained from the vote after accusing fellow EU leaders of excluding parties like her own from the conversation.  Ms von der Leyen, who has had the job of Commission president since 2019, will need 361 votes in order to be confirmed for a second term. Support from her own centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), the Socialists & Democrats and the liberal Renew should give her enough votes. But what makes things potentially tricky is that the vote is secret - meaning MEPs can cast ballots according to their inclinations rather than the declared party line. Several Irish MEPs belonging to centrist parties have said they would vote against Ms von der Leyen’s nomination because of her stance on the war in Gaza. Some French MEPs belonging to Ms von der Leyen’s own EPP grouping have also said they won't support her. To limit the potential for unwelcome surprises, over the past few weeks Ms von der Leyen has held private meetings with some parliamentary groupings in an attempt to secure their votes. Her bid has not always been successful. After one such meeting, MEPs belonging to the Left grouping said they had decided not to vote for Ms von der Leyen due to her willingness to increase military and defence spending. She also met with the Greens and received positive signals – although some MEPs said they would wait to hear Ms von der Leyen’s speech on Thursday before making a final decision. She reportedly managed to convince some members of the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) to back her, although the Romanian, French and Polish delegations have said they would vote against her.  The Italian prime minister, who leads the ECR, is also said to be holding off on making a decision on how she will instruct her 24 Italian MEPs to vote until after Ms von der Leyen's address. However, according to Italian media she is leaning towards endorsing Ms von der Leyen in exchange for Italy being offered a senior job in the next Commission – such as the coveted economy or competition portfolios. Ms Meloni, who heads the far-right Brothers of Italy party, has gained a prominent status among European right-wingers. The third biggest group in Parliament, the newly formed Patriots for Europe, has refused to back Ms von der Leyen. Formed by Hungary's Viktor Orban, it includes the leaders of far-right parties in France, Austria and the Netherlands. If Ms von der Leyen does not pass today’s European Parliament vote, the EU will be back to square one, with leaders having to agree on a new candidate who would then need to be approved by the Parliament. Although names have been floated, no obvious alternative candidate has emerged so far. Ms von der Leyen won the job five years ago, when her name was put forward by EU leaders in a last-minute deal after a political stalemate over other contenders. At the time, she was voted in with only nine votes over the required majority. Thursday's vote might end up being just as close.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2q0g5dr901o,"Laura Gozzi,",Unknown,
464,Boys rescued in Zambia after circumcision abductions,"Forty-eight boys in Zambia have been rescued from a male circumcision camp, after desperate complaints by some parents that their children had been abducted. One of the boys was on HIV medication and had not taken his anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs for two weeks, officials confirmed to the BBC. Secretive traditional rite-of-passage ceremonies see boys aged between 10 and 17 spending up to six months in seclusion in the bush. The authorities said the site, on the outskirts of Livingstone town, near a national wildlife park, had been set up without permission - alleging the children were “caged” in unsanitary and dangerous conditions. Three of the rescued boys were briefly admitted to hospital – some for treatment from complications after undergoing circumcision typically done using razor blades. According to the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), one of the boys was suffering from bilharzia, a chronic illness spread through contaminated water that impairs growth and brain development in children. The initiation site, which was established a fortnight ago, has since been burnt down, the country’s national broadcaster says. Those setting up such camps search for uncircumcised boys to undergo the ritual, known as “mukanda” - often going to schools and forcing their way into classrooms to pick up those they deem the right age. Their parents are not consulted and teachers can do little to resist their bullying tactics. Some of the boys go along willingly but many are coerced and told they cannot buck the tradition. The person who set up this camp was reprimanded on Monday by Mainga Kabika, the top civil servant in the gender ministry. She led a team of officials from various ministries to Livingstone, a tourist hub for those visiting the nearby Victoria Falls, to investigate the parents’ complaints. “We want to preserve our tradition but you have to follow regulations. You just don’t do things against the law like this,” Ms Kabika said. According to Zambia’s Daily Mail newspaper, some of the boys had been physically abused by those in charge at the site after they had tried to escape at night – including the boy in need of ARVs. Parents had reportedly been contacted by phone with demands of up to $75 (£58) for expenses, despite not giving permission for their child’s participation. Although surgical male circumcision is available at both public and private hospitals in Zambia - often encouraged as a way of reducing HIV infection - certain ethnic groups prefer the traditional approach. The procedure tends to take place in the Southern Hemisphere winter to minimise the discomfort associated with the healing process – though the rite of passage is intended to be a test of endurance. The boys are expected to put up with pain and difficult living conditions – for example they sleep on the bare ground with no blankets - to prove their move from boyhood to manhood. The initiation is steeped in secrecy - it is a cultural taboo to talk about it and women are not allowed to go near a circumcision site. “How do you keep these children without their parents’ consent, is that what the tradition says?” Ms Kabika is quoted as saying. Billy Milimo, secretary of the Livingstone District Education Board, welcomed the move, saying the tradition was harmful to the community. “You do not know how excited we are. Our teachers will jubilate and dance,” he is quoted by the Daily Mail as saying. The owner of the camp was initially arrested but released on condition he burn down the site of the camp - mainly made up of rough wooden shelters - which not only bordered the Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park but was also next to a cemetery.

463,Texans face days-long deadly heat wave without power,"More than a week after Hurricane Beryl swept through Texas and left millions without power, nearly 60,000 people in the state still do not have electricity.  The issue is more than an inconvenience, as many in the state have faced a deadly days-long heat wave that claimed its latest victim on Tuesday.   Local news reported that a woman was found dead in her apartment after spending the last eight days in her home without electricity and air conditioning. The heat index in Houston had climbed to 110F (43F) the day her body was discovered.  With the power issue lingering and more than a dozen deaths now linked to the heat, frustrations in Houston have started to boil over - particularly as the forecasts for the coming days warn of high temperatures.  Armed residents living without electricity have reportedly harrassed and threatened workers from CenterPoint Energy, the local energy provider, who have been sent out to restore power.  Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a statement saying that CentrePoint Energy ""has lost the faith and trust of Texans"".  He issued a July 31 deadline for the company to respond to questions about what  went wrong and what can be done to mitigate hurricane damage to the electric grid.  On Monday, Lynnae Wilson, a senior CenterPoint vice president told USA Today: “We know the remaining customers are counting on us and are committed to restoring power to all remaining customers able to receive it."" Texas officials have reported 18 deaths related to Hurricane Beryl. In the Houston area, several were due to heat exposure after losing power, the Associated Press reported, citing the Harris County medical examiner's office. The electricity at Emily Schkud's home, who lives on the north side of Houston with her husband and two children, was finally restored on Tuesday evening. ""It just is quite shocking,"" Mrs Schkud told BBC News.  ""You would think we're in a third-world country, to be out of power for nine days.""  Mrs Schkud considers herself ""lucky"" that she survived Hurricane Beryl's deadly blow on 8 July.  But life without power was difficult and forced her to live ""day-by-day"", Mrs Schkud said. She stayed at a neighbour's home and in hotels as she waited for word that power would be restored. ""It was very concerning and extremely stressful,"" she said, as she felt that her main role as a parent was to ensure her children ""are safe and have access to food and water"". Between the hotels and eating out every meal, she estimated the cost her family incurred could be as high as $10,000 (£7,689). At its worst, nearly three million people in Texas were without power after Beryl struck, most of them in the Houston area.  Lingering power outages mixed with high temperatures caused a strain on local hospitals that soon became overflowed.  Churches and libraries were converted into cooling centres. Houston's football stadium became a ""transitional facility"" for hospitals at capacity. Roughly 150 ""seasonal relief"" spaces were open in the Houston area on Wednesday, as hot summer temperatures show no signs of cooling.  Temperatures in the area are supposed to remain high through the weekend, peaking at or above 90F (32C). Climate scientists say that average daily temperatures globally have increased, making hotter days more likely and more intense. The cause is often linked to human-led climate change. Dozens of deaths related to the heat have been reported in the US in the past two weeks, including in states like Oregon that are known for their mild climates.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0w4vnel55no,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-17 22:11:08,
462,Police were stationed in building Trump gunman shot from,"Police were stationed inside the building from which gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots at Donald Trump, the director of the US Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle says. Ms Cheatle told ABC News that local police were inside the building while Crooks was on the roof, and that local police - not the Secret Service - had been “responsible"" for securing the building and its outer perimeter.  Questions have swirled about how police officers and agents tasked with securing Trump's Pennsylvania rally allowed Crooks to get as close as he did. He was able to access the roof of a building near the outdoor event at Butler County fairgrounds, Pennsylvania, from where he shot at Trump 130m (430ft) away. The local police deployment inside the building comprised three snipers, who are alleged to have seen Crooks trying to get on the roof, according to sources quoted by CBS News, the BBC's US partner.  One audience member was killed and two others critically injured in the shooting. Trump was wounded in the ear. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that his agency was responsible for securing inside the perimeter of the fairgrounds, while local police secured the area outside, which included the private building used by the gunman. The local sheriff's department referred BBC questions to the state police, which said it was not responsible for the area containing the building. A state police spokesman told the BBC that it provided ""all resources"" requested by the Secret Service, including between 30 to 40 troopers inside the perimeter. Many observers have questioned how security plans broke down to allow the gunman unobstructed access to Trump. Crowd members said they had spotted the suspect on the roof minutes before the shooting started, while Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe said a local security officer had also spotted him but could not stop him. The sheriff admitted there had been ""a failure"" in securing the premises, but said he believed that there was no single party to blame. It is common for the US Secret Service to rely on local police for help when securing rallies, said Jason Russell, founder of Secure Environments Consultants who worked as an agent from 2002 to 2010, including during election campaigns. “The Secret Service doesn’t have unlimited resources in terms of agents that they can post everywhere,” he told the BBC. He said that agents usually scope out a campaign event’s venue days in advance to develop a security plan that is then shared with local police agencies. During an event, he said communications were shared with every agency involved. However, he added that in ""the 10 seconds that it takes"" for information to flow through, that could be just enough time for a gunman to fire a few shots. The rooftop was a known vulnerability before the event, according to NBC News, which cited two sources familiar with Secret Service operations. Mr Russell said it was probable that Secret Service agents identified that building as a threat, and had requested local authorities to station officers nearby to prevent access. “For whatever reason, that didn’t happen,” he said. One witness, Thomas Gleason, who served 21 years with the US Army as paratrooper and ranger, said ""there should have been greater security for a long-range threat"". ""Looking at the distance and vantage point, if someone is going to try to assassinate [Trump] that would have been the most logical shooting point,"" he said. The FBI has since taken over the role of lead investigator into the incident, and the shooting is now the subject of several other investigations by both the House and the Senate. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas called it a “failure” of security, telling CNN that ""an incident like this cannot happen again"". Ms Cheatle said on Monday that her agency is working with federal and local police to ""understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from taking place again"". ""The buck stops with me,"" she said in the ABC interview, adding that she would not step down in the face of mounting calls from some lawmakers. A briefing for Senators on 17 July left many questions unanswered, with Senator Ron Johnson describing the call as ""unbelievably uninformative"", with only four questions permitted.  John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, told CBS that the senators were told Crooks was identified well before the attack and he was found carrying a range finder and a backpack.  ""The Secret Service lost sight of him,"" he added. ""No one has taken responsibility. No one has been held responsible.""  Ms Cheatle has been subpoenaed to face the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on 22 July. Republicans on the committee have also called on the Secret Service to produce evidence including internal communications, audio and video recordings, messages to local law enforcement, maps, diagrams and pre-event assessments. Additionally, House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that a bipartisan task force will be assembled to investigate the assassination attempt and concerns about how security was handled.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd167v5lpq2o,"Bernd Debusmann Jr,",2024-07-17 22:11:08,
468,Lewd tourist antics on Florence statue lead to outrage,"There has been outrage in Italy after a female tourist in Florence was pictured miming a lewd act on a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and excess. In the photos - which were shared online by the social media account Welcome To Florence - the woman can also be seen kissing the life-size statue at night-time. The Bacchus stands on a plinth on a street corner near the famous Ponte Vecchio bridge and is a modern replica of the 16th Century work by sculptor Giambologna. The original is kept in the nearby Bargello museum. The photos sparked angry reactions from social media users, some of whom called for the woman's arrest. ""This is the result of years of attempts at turning Florence into Disneyland,"" said another. Patrizia Asproni, the president of Confcultura, an association that promotes Italy's cultural heritage, told Italian media that these ""repeated shows of rudeness and barbarity"" take place ""because everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want with impunity"". Ms Asproni called for the application of the ""Singapore model"" with ""tight checks, sky-high fines and zero tolerance"" for bad behaviour. Antonella Rinaldi, Florence's archaeology and fine arts superintendent, said: ""Tourists are welcome here but they need to respect our artworks, be they originals or replicas."" ""Although I doubt this lady - whom I condemn - even knows the difference,"" she added. Florence is one of the world's foremost tourist destinations.  In 2023, around 1.5 million people visited the city - which has a population of just 382,000 - between June and September. Local residents have long struggled with the huge influx of tourists, which in the summer months turns Florence's narrow streets into steady streams of people.  The so-called ""overtourism"" phenomenon has prompted several cities around the world to make changes to the way they welcome tourists.  Last month, the mayor of Barcelona pledged to eliminate short-term tourist lets in the city within five years, while several hotspots - like Venice or Japan's Mount Fuji - have started to introduce daily charges to try to limit numbers.",2024-07-17 23:11:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5yky19623o,"Laura Gozzi,",2024-07-17 10:11:08,

479,The remarkable afterlife of a notorious 1990s flop,"Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Stanley Kubrick's final film was poorly received on its release in the summer of 1999. But 25 years on, it's been reappraised as a masterpiece and endlessly theorised over. ""Those were not just ordinary people!"" warns upper-class financier Victor Ziegler (a slimy Sydney Pollack) to a shaky Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise). The latter, a doctor to the elite, is still processing a mansion's masked ball he snuck into the previous night, which descended into a possibly murderous orgy. Ziegler, a high-profile client of Bill's, continues in his trademark arrogant yet fatherly tone: ""If I told you their names, Bill, you wouldn’t sleep so well"".   Released 25 years ago this week, director Stanley Kubrick's divisive swansong Eyes Wide Shut, with a story centring on – among other things – the twisted misdeeds of the rich, has arguably never felt more relevant. Resonating strongly with recent real-life examples of elite degeneracy – notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was the ""living embodiment of"" the shadowy Ziegler, according to new biography Kubrick: An Odyssey – it has subsequently sparked fervent online conspiracy theories about the Hollywood sins the auteur was allegedly trying to expose. From YouTube deep dives to Reddit speculation, there has been a lot of discussion about everything from its supposed prescience to its dense, symbol-filled visuals. ""All of Kubrick's movies tend to grow with time and Eyes Wide Shut is structured in a way to deliberately intrigue people and ignite discussions,"" film-maker Tony Zierra – who has directed an upcoming documentary, SK13: Kubrick's Nightmare Dream, dissecting the film's hidden meanings – tells the BBC. ""You see the film's themes reflected in news events. Whether it's the exposure of corrupt politicians, or sex scandals [in] celebrity culture or the entertainment industry, Eyes Wide Shut gets mentioned. Kubrick made a film that lives and changes with the time. I believe that's why he was so proud of it and told all his friends it was his best creation."" Yet all this feverish intrigue feels a long way from Eyes Wide Shut's initial lukewarm reaction. It featured ""the dullest orgy ever seen"" and a ""grindingly pedantic, glacial pace"" according to an infamous Washington Post review, while many other reviews were similarly scathing, even if commercially it fared somewhat better. (Indeed, the film remains Kubrick's biggest at the box office, taking just over $160m (£124m) internationally.) Marketed as a conventional erotic thriller, the film's original reveal trailer, which had been edited by Kubrick himself and was soundtracked by Chris Isaak's Baby did a Bad Bad Thing, suggested an intensely sexual film filled with sensuous glances and hot-under-the-collar friction. The two hour and 39-minute film Kubrick ultimately delivered was very different. Tragically, the director died in his sleep of a heart attack on 7 March 1999 shortly after handing in a final cut. Eyes Wide Shut is, at its heart, about a couple in crisis: the emotionally closed-off Bill is sent into an existential spiral after his wife Alice (an emotional ticking time bomb of a performance by Nicole Kidman) reveals she once fantasised about sleeping with a sailor she had exchanged glances with on holiday. While Alice didn't act on her impulses, the encounter has become part of her dreams and subconscious, and this is enough to send an enraged Bill off into the night, where he sleepwalks into one disastrous sexual encounter after another, unsure if he wants to seek out comfort or revenge. At the time Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were Hollywood's biggest ""It"" couple, their every move documented by pulsing paparazzi cameras. The salacious hype around the film got to the point where tabloids were actively speculating about how much nudity the film would feature, the misleading trailer undoubtedly throwing fuel on an already burning fire and resulting in audiences confused over the Kafka-esque dread the final film instead delivered. ""People were used to Tom Cruise having boyish good looks and irresistible charm, but here he was stripped of any sexual prowess. His male gaze is blunted. It was a very brave performance,” explains Nathan Abrams, a film professor at Bangor University and the co-author of Kubrick: An Odyssey. ""Kubrick was dissecting his lead man's celebrity."" A deep rumination on marriage, the film is, much like the 1926 novella Rhapsody: A Dream Novel by Arthur Schnitzler it is based on, rooted in the idea of love as a salvation amid dark times. The trailer, therefore, ""was a complete miscalculation and it caused a lot of confusion,"" Abrams added. ""Had Kubrick lived [to see the release], he would have corrected course and changed the marketing completely, I'm sure."" A famous perfectionist, Kubrick re-created New York City at London's Pinewood Studios (including a reference to a Jewish bagel shop he once visited as a young man) and made an exhausted Tom Cruise walk through doors hundreds of times until the shot was just right. There are claims he engineered mistrust between the Hollywood couple, too, with Abrams' biography alleging Cruise was forbidden to be on set when Kidman filmed sex sequences with another male actor (playing the sailor), creating a tension that would inject their performances with lovelorn angst. During pre-production, Kubrick had sent out photographers to New York's Greenwich Village, so they could photograph passers-by for months and months, living in all weather conditions, whose outfits he could then replicate in the film's wardrobe. He even got them to measure the sidewalks, inch-by-inch. Precisely re-capturing the Big Apple's aesthetic was especially important. Yet Abrams argues Kubrick was also exhausted from this intense and meticulous process. He slept and ate poorly, while he was so weak he needed to be lifted back up by camera operators after bending down. A 400-day shoot, which was then the longest continuous shoot in Hollywood history, resulted in visible bags under Kubrick's eyes. ""He was very frail,"" Abrams says, pouring cold water on one of the internet's most popular conspiracy theories around the film: that Kubrick didn't die of a heart attack…but was rather killed off by the elites for revealing too much with Eyes Wide Shut and its orgy sequence. ""He smoked sometimes too. Perfecting the art meant more than protecting his health.""  One particularly vocal fan is Sean McCann, a podcaster who has dedicated hundreds of hours to theorising about the film. The ending of Eyes Wide Shut famously depicts Bill and Alice walking their daughter Helena through a toy shop. In a witty yet fraught exchange, the married couple decide to finally move on from all their petty jealousies and mind games by working things out in the bedroom. Biographer Abrams believes it's one of the most hopeful endings of any Kubrick film. McCann, however, insists it in fact features Helena being kidnapped (he claims two bald men in the background usher her away) and that the ""Magic Circle"" boardgame seen in the toy shop (its cover image replicating the blood red circle floor at the orgy) is a reminder that the cult Bill barely escaped from has ears and eyes everywhere. In McCann's imagining, they're finally punishing Bill for revealing their existence to his wife given that, at the sinister orgy, a mysterious figure in a red cloak (played by Kubrick's long term assistant, Leon Vitali) warns Dr Bill of ""dire consequences"" for his family should he ever speak out. He says another earlier sequence, where Bill sneaks into the masked ball with the password ""Fidelio"", is filled with Freemason symbolism (including the Eye of Providence, which can clearly be seen as part of an eerie Venetian mask) and allusions to royalty (Bill is advised to wear an ermine cloak, a material associated with kingly robes). These are hints from Kubrick, McCann says, of the types of elites who might attend one of these masked parties and the existence of secret societies. ""I do get a buzz out of it!"" McCann admits of his devotion to dissecting the film. ""It's because I like to understand the hidden meanings behind things. The process of discovery makes you feel more enlightened. I'd say I was watching this movie twice a week, at least, for around two to three years."" Rather than seeing it as a film rooted in exposing hidden realities, Abrams says Eyes Wide Shut is about ""unreality"", and should be considered as a ""dreamscape"". For some street scenes, Kubrick filmed Cruise walking on a treadmill, giving a floaty peculiarity to his movement, and the recurring use of red neon lights imbues the film with a trippy glow caught right between Christmas comfort and living nightmare. The central musical theme, meanwhile, is a chopped and screwed up series of backwards chants by Romanian priests. ""The film is set in December, yet you can't see anyone's breath in the air,"" explains Abrams. ""It all adds up to this air of unreality."" Meanwhile the movie opens with Alice literally looking through the looking glass – an ode to the surreal Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. Abrams agrees with Pollack, who once speculated of the film's psychedelic powers: ""I don't think there was much in Eyes Wide Shut that was realistic, or that was intended to be realistic."" It's a great irony, then, that online theorists come away with such definitive ideas about what the hallucinatory Eyes Wide Shut means. However, this also wouldn't be the first time a Kubrick film has sparked so much rigorous debate over its true meaning. Some believe the dense The Shining is littered with references to the holocaust and genocide of Native Americans (theories explored in the excellent 2012 documentary Room 237), while the ending of Kubrick's magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey, has been interpreted as everything from man evolving into a new form (or the Übermensch as Nietzsche put it) to the confirmation of a God.  Abrams understands why Kubrick films can be perceived in so many ways. ""There's a whole industry of YouTubers and also academics working out the meaning of these films,"" he says. ""Whether or not Kubrick deliberately inserted hidden meanings in the films or not, I can tell you he had a massive book on code breaking and subliminal messaging. A lot like the conspiracy theorists, he enjoyed that pursuit [of figuring something out].  ""But the thing worth remembering is this: yes, Kubrick did this exhaustive research on symbols, but once the cameras started rolling, it was all about how things looked. He didn't care about continuity at all and was just splicing everything together. I've interviewed a lot of Kubrick's collaborators and they say the symbols were on the screen simply because they looked cool. Kubrick's mentality was very much: 'we'll let the French critics tell us what everything means.'"" Although Eyes Wide Shut feels hyper-relevant, Abrams would like the critical lens to now shift and for people to notice more of the film's warmth and nostalgia, particularly around the love of Kubrick's life: his wife Christiane. Mrs Kubrick's warm paintings, from a pregnant woman to a chicken hopping through a blissful garden, are littered throughout Bill and Alice's apartment, while the latter character is even styled to look like Christiane with both Kidman's glasses and hair copying hers. Kubrick famously rejected Hollywood social circles, choosing to live a reclusive existence in a rural mansion in Hertfordshire, England. Just like Bill, some might say, he rejected the allure of an elite group and chose to be renewed by the sanctuary of marriage and family (another painting in the film's background was made by Kubrick's daughter of the family cat, Olly), making Eyes Wide Shut one of Kubrick's more intimate autobiographical works. ""This film is a tribute to Kubrick's whole life, but particularly the maturity being married to Christiane gave him. Her influence is in a lot of scenes,"" says Abrams. “Kubrick was famous for his meticulous research: he knew he had to live out 40 years of marriage before he directed this film's themes. Eyes Wide Shut was something Kubrick wanted to make since the 1950s."" Stanley Kubrick told collaborators that Eyes Wide Shut was his ""best work"" and, despite the initial critical malaise, it has, like a lot of the auteur's films, been re-assessed as a masterpiece by everyone from Martin Scorsese to film bible Sight and Sound, which wrote in its 2019 retrospective: ""It's testament to Eyes Wide Shut's idiosyncratic, enigmatic brilliance that the film continues to inspire such unpredictable responses.""  On one level, Eyes Wide Shut can be seen as reflecting the director's deep-set belief that one should ""never go near power"", Abrams says, but for him, the prevailing message is about the renewal of love and resisting temptation. McCann counters: ""Eyes Wide Shut is about the nature of power and mind control. Everything has a purpose in the film, from the recurrence of a tiger plush toy to the double headed eagle [that appears on a throne in the orgy scene].  Remember: Kubrick wasn't Jackson Pollock, just slapping a piece of art together. Every single detail is put in the frame for a reason. Every scene is a perfect photograph. He was a genius."" More like this:  • The mystery behind Kubrick's Dr Strangelove  • Is this the most controversial film ever made?  • Is Tom Cruise the last action hero? Whatever the reality might be, we'll never know for sure, with Stanley Kubrick taking the secrets of Eyes Wide Shut with him to the grave. But it feels important to give the legendary auteur the last word. Speaking to Playboy in 1968 in a rare interview, where he dived into the meanings behind nuclear war comedy, Dr Strangelove, Kubrick said: ""The very meaninglessness of life forces man to create his own meaning. Man has been cut adrift in a rudderless boat on an uncharted sea; if he is going to stay sane throughout the voyage, he must have someone to care about, something that is more important than himself."" For some Eyes Wide Shut fans, the film has become that solace, as they thrill in looking for – to quote a memorable line – ""where the rainbow ends"". -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

478,Common blood-thinning drug neutralises cobra venom,"A drug commonly prescribed to thin blood can be repurposed as a cheap antidote to cobra venom, a team of scientists based in Australia, Canada, Costa Rica and the UK has discovered.  Snakebites kill about 138,000 people a year, mostly in poorer rural areas in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, South and South East Asia. More than 400,000 others develop necrosis, when the tissue around the bite dies and turns black.  Cobras account for most bites in parts of Africa and India. And Heparin can neutralise the necrosis-causing toxins in some spitting cobras' venom. The drug is not effective against all snake venom - but the scientists say it could be  cheaper and more flexible than existing antivenoms, many of which work against only a single snake species and cannot prevent necrosis. Having already tested the drug on mice, the next step will be human trials. Senior study author Prof Greg Neely, from the University of Sydney, said: “Our discovery could drastically reduce the terrible injuries from necrosis caused by cobra bites – and it might also slow the venom, which could improve survival rates. ""Biological agents like venoms and toxins all require some collaboration from the host side, the human side, so our study was to identify what, in humans, interacts with the venom to create this necrosis and death. ""What we’re finding is when we take different venoms from very different species, there’s a small number of ways they interact with human cells.  ""One of the cool things from a science perspective is that we think we can identify four or five different ways that venoms as a whole interact with cells - and then we can make universal antidotes that can block big groups of species. ""We hope that the new cobra antidote we found can assist in the global fight to reduce death and injury from snakebite in some of the world’s poorest communities."" Lead author, PhD student Tian Du, also from the University of Sydney, called it a big step forward. ""Heparin is inexpensive, ubiquitous and a World Health Organization-listed essential medicine,"" she said.  ""After successful human trials, it could be rolled out relatively quickly to become a cheap, safe and effective drug for treating cobra bites."" Another of the scientists, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Centre for Snakebite Research and Interventions head Prof Nicholas Casewell, said: ""Snakebites remain the deadliest of the neglected tropical diseases, with its burden landing overwhelmingly on rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. ""Our findings are exciting because current antivenoms are largely ineffective against severe local envenoming, which involves painful progressive swelling, blistering and/or tissue necrosis around the bite site.  ""This can lead to loss of limb function, amputation and lifelong disability.""",2024-07-17 23:11:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gwv284y1o,"Dominic Hughes,",2024-07-17 18:11:09,
480,Glen Powell to finish degree while making new film,"Despite being Hollywood's hottest new star, Glen Powell has said he will finish studying for his degree while shooting his next movie. The actor – who recently starred in Top Gun: Maverick, Anyone But You and Twisters – plans to complete his Spanish and early American history degree at the University of Texas. Powell, 35, is from Austin, Texas, and has recently moved back to his home state to be closer to his family, after living in Hollywood. Speaking to IndieWire, Powell said he plans to attend Zoom classes while he’s working on his next film, a remake of 1987 sci-fi film The Running Man, in the UK. ""So I’m going to be in London, but I am going to be going back for proctored [supervised] exams,"" he said. ""They’re letting me figure it out [with] distance learning. ""And I'm obviously going to be coming in, Zooming in for classes and whatnot, but I have to be back for the proctored exams."" He will have to return to Texas ""two or three times a semester"", and said The Running Man director Edgar Wright had been understanding. ""Edgar has been very nice about letting me finish my degree in the middle of his massive movie."" In May, Powell was the cover star on a Hollywood Reporter issue about ""the new A-list"". He told the magazine he felt he was able to return to Texas because ""getting to this point in Hollywood [means] that I can now leave Hollywood"". He added that he felt ""like I’ve earned the ability to go back to my family"", and was given the advice to move by fellow Texan actor Matthew McConaughey. Powell also told the publication it was an ""emotional thing"" to finish the degree, which he started before he reached this level of fame. ""I think it’s really important to my mom and it’s more of an emotional thing for me,"" he said. The actor is incredibly close to his parents, who regularly attend press events with him, and two sisters. In the interview with IndieWire, Powell clarified that he has ""nothing against Hollywood"" – but he would be happier spending time in Austin between projects. ""I love being around people who love entertainment, and I love what [Hollywood] represents. ""Coming here for little chunks of time and doing all the stuff I need to do here, it’s great. ""And I have nothing against Hollywood.  ""I just realised, in terms of filling up the pieces of me that need to be refuelled between projects and doing stuff like that, that’s all Austin for me.""",2024-07-17 23:11:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng3n2drjxo,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-17 10:11:09,
476,Smoke on the horizon - Israel and Hezbollah edge closer to all-out war,"As the war in Gaza grinds on, there are growing fears another Middle East war may erupt - with devastating consequences for the region, and beyond. Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah (backed by Iran) have been trading fire across their shared border for the past nine months. If this conflict escalates to all-out war, it could dwarf the destruction in Gaza, draw in Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, spread embers around the Middle East and embroil the US. Iran itself could intervene directly. The United Nations has warned of a “catastrophe beyond imagination”. For now, a low-level war simmers in the summer heat, along a 120km (75 mile) stretch of border. One spark here could set the Middle East alight. Over the lapping of the waves, and the thwack thwack of paddle games on the beach, a sound cuts through - a sudden deep boom. Soon smoke billows from a hillside in the distance after an Israeli strike. Around the pool in a resort hotel, a few sunbathers stand briefly to scan the horizon. Others don’t move a tanned limb. Explosions are part of the sound of summer 2024 in the ancient Lebanese city of Tyre, as Hezbollah and Israel exchange fire across the border 25 kilometres (15 miles) away. “Another day, another bomb,” says Roland, 49, with a shrug, as he relaxes on a lilo. He lives abroad but is back home on holiday. “We got used to it somehow over the months,” says his friend Mustafa, 39, “though children are still a little bit scared.” He nods towards his daughter Miral, 7, who is dripping wet from the pool. “When she hears an explosion, she always asks, ‘will there be a bomb now?’” he says. Earlier this month, there was a massive blast in his neighbourhood in Tyre, as his family of four were having a meal. Israel had assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander, Mohammed Nimah Nasser. “We heard the noise,” Mustafa says, “and we carried on eating.” But the sunbathers on the beach in Tyre may be on borrowed time. This city will be in the firing line in the event of all-out war, along with the rest of southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold. We are now at the water’s edge of a potentially devastating war which both sides say they don’t want. Iran doesn’t seem to want it either. How did we get here? On October 8th last year – one day after Hamas gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed about 1,200 Israelis as well as taking 251 others hostage – Hezbollah joined in, firing at Israeli targets from Lebanon. The Shia Islamist armed group said it was acting in support of Gaza. Soon Israel was firing back. Hezbollah, which is also a political party, is the most powerful force in Lebanon. Like Hamas, it is classed as a terrorist organisation by many countries, including the UK and the US. But unlike Hamas, Hezbollah has the firepower to seriously threaten Israel. It is believed to have an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles - some precision-guided - capable of inflicting heavy damage around the country. Put simply Hezbollah - its English translation, the Party of God - has more arms than many countries. Its backer Iran – which denies Israel’s right to exist – is happy to train and fund the enemies of the Jewish state. The conflict has been heating up, with thousands of cross-border strikes. Some countries have already told their nationals to leave Lebanon urgently, including Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Saudi Arabia. The UK has advised against all travel to the country and is urging Britons who are here to leave - while they still can. So far, both sides are mainly striking military targets, close to the border -  staying within familiar red lines. But here on the Lebanese side, we have seen destruction in civilian areas with scorched fields, flattened houses and abandoned villages. And the current tit-for-tat has already driven tens of thousands from their homes - more than 90,000 in Lebanon and about 60,000 in Israel. Israeli officials say 33 people have been killed so far in Hezbollah attacks, mostly soldiers. Lebanon’s losses are far higher at 466, according to the Ministry of Health here. Most of the dead were fighters. Sally Skaiki was not. “I never called her Sally,” says her father Hussein Abdul Hassan Skaiki. “I always called her ‘my life’ - she was everything for me.” “She was the only girl in the house, and we spoiled her, me and her three brothers.” Sally, 25, was a volunteer paramedic. She was killed by an Israeli strike after sunset on 14 June as she stood in the doorway of her building. Her father wears the black of mourning, and the green scarf of the Shia Amal movement, which is allied to Hezbollah. We meet in his village of Deir Qanoun En-Naher, 30km (18 miles) from the border. The main road is dotted with sun-bleached posters of fighters killed in battle against Israel - some in recent months, others back in 2006 when the two sides last went to war. In that conflict, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill but at huge cost to Lebanon and its people. There was massive destruction, and more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed - according to official figures - along with an unconfirmed number of Hezbollah fighters. Israel’s death toll was 160, according to the government, most of them soldiers. By Hussein’s side there is a large poster of Sally, in her headscarf and paramedic uniform. He speaks of his daughter with pride and with anguish. “She loved to help people,” he says. “Any problem that happened, she rushed there. She was well-loved in the village. She always had a smile on her face.” As we speak there is a loud boom which rattles the windows. Hussein says it is a normal, daily occurrence. “Since a long time, Israel killed our people here,” he says. “We can’t forgive them. There is no hope of peace with them.” This time, there is no death or destruction. Instead, Israeli warplanes are breaking the sound barrier to spread fear. And, since October, Israel has been spreading something else in southern Lebanon - choking, searing clumps of white phosphorus, contained in munitions. The chemical substance ignites immediately on contact with oxygen. It sticks to skin and clothing and can burn through bone, according to the World Health Organization. Moussa al-Moussa - a farmer stooped by his 77 years - knows only too well. He says Israel fired white phosphorous shells at his land in the village of al-Bustan every day for over a month, robbing him of breath, and his livelihood. “I had my scarf on, and I wrapped it around my mouth and nose until I was brought to the hospital,” he tells me, gesturing to the red and white keffiyeh – the traditional Arab scarf - on his head. “We didn’t have any masks.  I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see a metre in front of me. And if you touch a fragment a week later it will ignite and burn again.” The international campaign group, Human Rights Watch, has verified the use of white phosphorus over several populated areas in southern Lebanon, including al-Bustan. It says Israel’s use of white phosphorus is “unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas”. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dispute this, saying the use of white phosphorus shells to create a smokescreen “is lawful under international law”.  It says these shells are not used in densely populated areas “with certain exceptions”. Like many farmers along the border, Moussa fears Israel has poisoned his tobacco crop and his olive groves. “White phosphorous burns the ground, it burns people and the crops and buildings,” he says. Even if he can return home, he is afraid to bring in a harvest in case it harms his family or his buyers. He lives in limbo - in classroom 4B of a vocational school in Tyre. About 30 families who fled the border area are sheltering in the building. Washing is strung across the school yard. A lone little boy races up and down the empty corridors on a bicycle. When I ask Moussa how many wars he has seen, he begins to laugh. “We spent our lives in wars,” he says. “Only God knows if another one is coming.” As one of Hezbollah’s most senior commanders, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was a wanted man. He fought Israel in 2006, and before, and went on to fight in Syria and Iraq. In recent months he “planned, led and supervised many military operations against the Israeli enemy”, according to Hezbollah. Israel tracked him down in Tyre on 3 July. Death came from the sky in broad daylight, with an air strike which turned his car into a fireball. In the Hezbollah stronghold of south Beirut, he was given a hero’s funeral, or rather a “martyr’s” one. The event was carefully choreographed and strictly segregated - men in one area, women in another - including the press. His coffin, draped in the yellow flag of Hezbollah, was carried by pall bearers in camouflage uniforms and red berets. Many more fighters stood to attention, lines deep. There was a brass band in spotless white uniforms, if not in perfect harmony. It had the feel of a state funeral - in a country that lacks a functioning state. Lebanon has no president, a caretaker government and a shattered economy. It is carved up by sect, and hollowed out by corruption, its citizens left to fend for themselves. Many Lebanese are weary. The last thing they want is another war. But as the funeral prayers concluded, the talk among mourners was of “martyrdom” not death, and of readiness for war, if it comes. Hassan Hamieh, a 35-year-old nurse, told us he would fight. “We are not afraid,” he said. “In fact, we are longing for an all-out war. Martyrdom is the shortest path to God. Young or old, we will all take part in this war, if it is forced upon us.” Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has stressed the armed group is ready, but not eager, for war. He says if there is a ceasefire agreed in Gaza, Hezbollah will cease fire too, immediately. Will that satisfy Israel? Maybe not. It sees Hezbollah as a permanent threat too close for comfort. At the very least, it wants its heavily armed enemy to pull back from the border. There have been plenty of bellicose threats. Israel’s Education Minister, Yoav Kish, said Lebanon would be “annihilated”. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant chimed in, saying the country would be returned “to the stone age”. As the attacks and counter attacks continue, families are destroyed. This month parents have been ripped from children, and children from parents. An Israeli couple were killed in their car by Hezbollah rockets as they headed for home in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria. They left behind three teenage children.  And in southern Lebanon three children were killed in an Israeli strike earlier this week. They were aged between four and eight, and their parents were Syrian farm workers. The IDF approved “operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon” a month ago. For now, no tanks are rolling over the border. There has been no political decision to attack. Israel is still waging war in Gaza and fighting on two fronts could overstretch the military. But without a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah - two old enemies - all-out war may be coming, if not now, then later.

475,An Olympic friendship that defied Hitler,"An Olympic friendship that defied Hitler It was an instinctive sporting gesture that has gone down in Olympic folklore, but, for German long-jump champion Luz Long, it would have dark consequences. As Jesse Owens soared over the eight-metre mark to secure gold at the 1936 Games, Long - his biggest rival - leapt into the sandpit in Berlin to hug and congratulate him. Later, in a striking contradiction to Nazi Germany's twisted notion of Aryan supremacy and decades before the civil rights movement would spark radical change in the United States, the pair shared a lap of honour together, black and white athlete jogging arm in arm. Not everyone was applauding. High in the stands, German leader Adolf Hitler watched on disapprovingly. As they stood on the podium - Long giving the required Nazi salute and Owens saluting the Stars and Stripes flag of a nation not yet ready to accept him wholly as one of their own - both athletes were unaware of what lay in store. German athletes who made it on to a podium at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin were required to offer the Nazi salute Owens and Long, both born in 1913, were at the peak of their athletic powers when they locked horns in Berlin.  But that is where the similarities ended; their beginnings and journeys to the Games were polar opposites. A 20th-century icon, Owens' story has been widely told. He was the grandson of former slaves and the youngest of 10 children in a family of Alabama tenant farmers. As a child, he picked cotton with the rest of his siblings, but his athletic ability became clear after the family moved to Cleveland and he was enrolled in school, aged nine. He had gone by the nickname JC, short for James Cleveland, but after his teacher misheard him he was registered as Jesse and the name stuck. Owens earned an athletic scholarship to attend Ohio State University where, under the tutelage of coach Larry Schnyder, he became one of the greatest sprinters the world has ever known. At a track and field meeting at the University of Michigan in 1935, Owens broke three world records and equalled another, all in the space of an hour, setting a new mark of 8.13m for the long jump that would stand for 25 years. Unlike his rival, Long enjoyed a privileged upbringing, born into a middle-class family in Leipzig. His father, Karl, owned a pharmacy in the centre of the city, while his mother, Johanna, was a qualified English teacher. She came from a respected academic family, which included scientist Justus von Liebig, known as the founder of organic chemistry. Carl Ludwig Hermann Long, who became known as Luz for short, grew up with his four siblings in the countryside outside the city. They would have family athletics championships in their sizeable back garden. Long joined Leipzig Sport Club in 1928, where he came under the guidance of coach Georg Richter, who helped him develop a technique of sailing through the air using his strength as a high-jumper, unlike Owens, who harnessed his pace as a sprinter. The partnership with Richter proved fruitful, as Long broke the German long jump record in 1933 to become national champion, aged just 20. Just a couple of months before the Berlin Olympics, Long set a new European long jump record of 7.82m en route to his third national title. Jesse Owens, left, and Luz Long, competing at the 1936 Olympics, adopted contrasting long jump styles  While both Owens and Long were building momentum on the track, they were also contending with the political landscape off it. In the United States, there was growing pressure to boycott the Berlin Games in light of stories about the treatment of Jewish people in Germany under the new Nazi regime. Owens initially supported calls for a boycott of the Games, reportedly telling the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People ""if there are any minorities in Germany who are being discriminated against, the United States should withdraw"". But he eventually agreed to attend following pleas from his coach and assurances from the United States Olympic Committee, who had sent a delegation to Germany to assess conditions and discuss the hosts' policy on the participation of Jewish athletes. Back in Germany, the political pressure placed on athletes by the state was increasing. ""Athletes were representatives of the German Reich - both on and off the ash track - not private individuals,"" says Julia Kellner-Long, Luz’s only grandchild. Long’s rise to the national team came in 1933 - the same year Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. In the unlikelihood that he was unaware what was expected of him, a banner posted at the training ground made it clear: ""Track and field athletes think of the 1936 Olympics. We must not disappoint our leader Adolf Hitler."" A banner over the German team's training ground reminded them of the political importance of the forthcoming Games. It read: 'Track and field athletes think of the 1936 Olympics. We must not disappoint our leader Adolf Hitler.' Hitler was present at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium as Owens and Long contested one of the Games' greatest long jump finals. After a see-sawing battle, Long matched Owens' leading distance of 7.87m with his penultimate attempt, to the delight of the home fans. But Owens dug out his best when he needed it most, responding with 7.94m, to move clear of Long once again. Long produced a foul on his final attempt, but his performance was good enough for silver and a first Olympic long jump medal for Germany. Owens, with his title already assured, created further history with a final leap of 8.06m - setting an Olympic record that would stand for 24 years. Long, putting aside his own disappointment, instinctively leapt into the sandpit to congratulate him.  Locked in that moment, alone in their embrace as an appreciative capacity crowd of more than 100,000 people watched on, Owens confided to his rival: ""You forced me to give my best."" Between them, Owens and Long had surpassed the previous Olympic record five times. ""It's almost like a fairytale - to jump so long in this weather,"" said Long in an interview with his hometown newspaper, Neue Leipziger Zeitung. ""I can't help it. I run to him. I'm the first to congratulate him, to hug him."" Long's impulsive reaction caught the attention of the German authorities. Soon after the Olympic Games, his mother, Johanna, made a note in her diary about a warning from Rudolf Hess, then deputy Fuhrer of the Nazi Party. Long, she wrote, had ""received an order from the highest authority"" that he should never again embrace a black person. He had been noted as ""not racially conscious"" by the Nazi regime. The embrace clearly angered the Nazis, who often used powerful imagery to further its own ideology and feared how Owens and Long's friendship might undermine its propaganda.  In that respect, they were right. Almost 90 years later, Owens and Long's friendship is one of the most enduring Olympic stories. ""The gesture of kindness and fairness touched the hearts of many people,"" says Kellner-Long. ""Together, Luz and Jesse enjoyed a special friendship that day, demonstrating to the world that in sports and in life, friendship and respect are the most important things, regardless of background or skin colour."" Stuart Rankin, Owens' only grandson, is equally struck by its significance. “I often say that of all my grandfather's accomplishments at the 1936 Olympics, the unlikely friendship that he struck with Luz Long is the thing of which I am most proud and most impressed by,” he says. ""For them to have forged that friendship, under those conditions, in those circumstances, in that stadium, in the face of Hitler, was just phenomenal."" Owens (right) credited Long (left) with helping him adjust his run-up after the American initially struggled in qualifying It would be the only time Owens and Long would compete against each other. Owens went on to add the 200m and 4x100m titles to his wins in the 100m and long jump and would take home four gold medals from the German capital. But he angered authorities by refusing to compete in a meeting in Sweden immediately after the Games, instead returning home to take advantage of his new-found fame and a clutch of commercial opportunities. The decision would result in Owens being banned from competing by the American Athletic Union - effectively ending his sporting career. Owens was still given a hero's welcome in a special homecoming ceremony in New York, but an incident at a party thrown in his honour at the Waldorf Astoria proved that despite his Olympic glory, nothing had changed. On arriving at the hotel, Owens was directed away from the lobby by a doorman to a side entrance he was told was for tradesmen and black people. It was a stark reminder of the deep-rooted division and racial prejudice at the heart of American society. Jesse Owens was given a hero's welcome on his return to America, but was asked to enter the Waldorf Astoria hotel using a separate entrance when attending a party thrown in his honour  Long left Berlin as Olympic silver-medallist, national champion and European long-jump record holder. He would go on to extend that mark to 7.90m the following year - a record that stood until 1956. But he could not escape scrutiny or suspicion. ""Luz's embrace in the sandpit had consequences,"" says Kellner-Long. ""He was placed under closer monitoring by the authorities, compelling him to tread more carefully and maintain a lower profile."" Luz Long enjoys a cuddle with his first son Kai in 1942, months before he was killed fighting for Germany during the Allied advance in Sicily  Long did not compete again after the outbreak of World War Two, instead focusing on his career as a lawyer. Heinrich, his youngest brother, was killed in action. Devastated by the loss, Long attempted to plot a course through the war for his own family. He married Gisela in 1941, and they had a son - Julia's father - in November of that year, naming him Kai Heinrich, after his lost brother. By then, Long had been drafted into the military, initially carrying out duties away from the frontline. However, in 1943 Long was shipped out to Sicily with the 10th Battery Parachute Anti-Aircraft Regiment. A month later, he would send his final letter home to Gisela, who, by this time, was heavily pregnant with their second son, Wolfgang Matthias. ""In the letter, Luz described camping in tents on a beautiful flower meadow surrounded by mountains, a peaceful setting - that was his final communication with his family,"" says Kellner-Long. ""The next day, 30 May 1943, Wolfgang was born. Unfortunately, Luz never got to meet him.” Allied forces landed in Sicily on 10 July 1943, as part of an operation to liberate Italy. Four days later, Long was hit in his leg by shrapnel, as German forces retreated, and bled to death. Gisela received notification on 30 July that her husband was missing in action, presumed dead. It was only after another seven years that the details were confirmed and his grave, in the German section of honour at the American military cemetery in Gela, was found. Owens (second from right) with Kai Long, Luz's son (second from left), on a 1951 visit to Germany  Owens chose not to enlist for military service during the war, and neither was he drafted. But, banned from official athletic competition and with commercial offers quickly drying up, he had to find unorthodox ways of supporting his family. He would take on local sprinters, giving them a 10 or 20-yard head start, before reeling them in with ease to claim a cash prize. Or, when his human rivals weren't forthcoming, Owens would race motorbikes, cars,  and horses. ""People say it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse,"" Owens said, ""but what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals."" Owens beats a horse and trap in a 100-yard race in 1948 in California  After flitting between menial jobs, things started to improve for Owens in the 1950s when he found employment as a motivational speaker. He started his own public relations business and became a sought-after figure, travelling around the globe as a sporting ambassador. During a trip to Germany in 1951, with the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team, Owens reached out to Long's family. He met Kai and took him to the Globetrotters game in Hamburg as his guest of honour. In 1964, Kai took part in a documentary, Jesse Owens Returns To Berlin, during which the two recreated a picture of Owens and Long reclining trackside at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Long's son Kai and Jesse Owens recreate an image from the 1936 Games at the city's Olympic Stadium in June 1964  ""Kai admired Jesse so much - his charisma, his modesty, and his natural gift and success as an athlete,"" says Kellner-Long. Owens was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1976, before his death from lung cancer four years later, aged 66.  He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1990. In 2016 then-president Barack Obama invited Owens' relatives to the White House for a reception that Jesse and the other black members of the 1936 US Olympic team had been denied after Berlin. , external His wife, Ruth, has continued his legacy, running the Jesse Owens Foundation before passing on the baton to their daughters - Gloria, Marlene and Beverly - and more recently their five grandchildren. Over the years, the Long and Owens families have stayed in touch.  Julia Kellner-Long, along with Owens' granddaughter Gina, lit the Olympic flame in a special ceremony at the Berlin Stadium in 2004. With Marlene, she then presented the long jump medals when the World Athletics Championships were held in Berlin in 2009. Kellner-Long and Rankin would become close friends after a chance meeting in Munich in 2012, and have recently worked together on a documentary about their grandparents. ""The relationship between the families means a lot to me, and I am proud of our connection,"" says Kellner-Long. ""Julia and I joke around often and think of both of our grandfathers looking down and smiling and being quite happy that the families are still connected despite the years,"" adds Rankin. Julia Kellner-Long (left) and Marlene Dortch (right) - granddaughters of Luz Long and Jesse Owens respectively - present long jump medals at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin While the reality of the friendship between Owens and Long is held dear by both families, their special bond has taken on a life of its own online. One widely repeated myth involves a vivid letter supposedly written by Long to Owens from the ""dry sand and wet blood"" of north Africa. It calls on Owens to return to Germany to find his son if Long fails to make it home. One of the lines reads: ""Tell him, Jesse, what times were like when we not separated by war, tell him how things can be between men on this earth."" Unbearably poignant, but almost certainly untrue. Long never served in north Africa. Neither family have seen such a letter and both question the likelihood and logistics of it being written and delivered. Kellner-Long understands the powerful message people continue to take from their story, however. ""It offers hope and inspiration to people worldwide,"" she says. ""In times when racism and exclusion are sadly still prevalent, this story is more relevant than ever."" ""I think that Luz's example of sportsmanship is one that should be preserved and held high for all time,"" says Rankin. ""My grandfather's relationship with Luz is certainly one he never would have predicted but, because it happened, it provided a hopeful perspective in my grandfather, and certainly in me, that, despite the tide of an entire nation, it doesn't mean every member of that nation is the same. ""Luz's strength and character, it's almost indescribable, but it demonstrates how in the most unlikeliest of places you can still find good.""

477,'They killed my son' - raw grief after Nigeria school collapse,"Jotted down on paper, this playful story about a lazy lion is now a memento of a young life lost. Chidera Onovo, 15, was a caring boy who loved to draw and was his mother’s unabashed favourite. ""He saved up his lunch money to buy biscuits to share with his siblings,"" Blessing Onovo recalls. ""And he was always the one who noticed my moods and would ask: 'Mummy are you fine?'."" Last Friday morning Chidera went to secondary school with his younger sister Chisom but only one of them would return. Official reports from the Nigerian government say 22 students were killed in the building collapse at Saints Academy, a private school in the central city of Jos, but local residents say the number is closer to 50.  Using their bare hands and shovels, parents desperately searched for survivors, managing to tunnel through and free some of the trapped children. ""It took about an hour before an excavator came,"" says Chidera’s father, Chike Michael Onovo. ""I saw my daughter Chisom being dragged out. I was relieved, but I kept shouting: 'Where is Chidera my son?'.""  The boy's body was later found, crushed by the fallen concrete in his classroom on the first floor. Also searching frantically that day was 43-year-old Victor Dennis. His worst fears were confirmed a day later when he found his son Emmanuel’s lifeless body at a local morgue. ""My boy was a good boy,"" he tells the BBC. ""He didn’t deserve to die. They killed my son. He didn’t do anything wrong. He just went to school to learn."" Tears fall from Mr Dennis' bloodshot eyes as mourners sing a farewell hymn at his son’s burial. Absent is his wife, Emmanuel’s mother, who is inconsolable with grief and stays at home. People in Jos have rallied to support one another, and many young lives have been saved thanks to blood donors who have visited local hospitals. But there is anger and disbelief that yet another building collapse has been allowed to happen in Nigeria. Residents even claim the children had felt the building shake the day before. ""Substandard materials were used - these could have been responsible for the collapse of the building,"" says regulator and architect Olusegun Godwin Olukoya, who leads the Nigerian Institute of Architects in Plateau state. ""Our preliminary investigations indicate that there was possible lack of adherence to building regulations."" He is scathing in his criticism of builders and the Nigerian authorities, telling the BBC: ""Unfortunately, due to the kind of society that we live in, lack of will has prevent the authorities from adopting our suggestions in the past.  ""People cut corners and when you try to raise alarm, some feel that you are trying to victimise or oppress them. They use their people in positions of authority to circumvent the rules."" Following the building collapse at Saints Academy, the local governor has ordered a structural audit of all schools and public buildings in Plateau state, of which Jos is the capital.  Officials in his government say it is not clear whether the school’s owner, who has since died, ever had a construction permit for the site. The BBC was unable to get comment from the school's management. Some also suspect that mining activity close by could have damaged the school building, so the governor has also ordered the arrest of any artisanal miners found digging in residential areas in the state. But officials suspect that the main problem was with how the school was built. ""Even as a layman who is not a building professional, you can see that the materials used in the construction are not standard. But we will investigate the cause of the collapse and punish those found culpable,"" Musa Ashom, the state Commissioner for Information, tells the BBC. Similar promises came from Nigeria's Housing Minister, Ahmed Dangiwa, who spoke scathingly of ""unscrupulous"" individuals whose actions he said had resulted in the Jos school collapse and caused unquantifiable loss. But those words will come as little consolation to the many bereft families, like that of Chinecherem Joy Emeka. The 13-year-old was one of the best dancers at her school and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day, says her mother Blessing Nwabuchi. Chinecherem, or Chi Chi as loved ones called her, was sitting her end-of year exams the day she died. Photos like this one, from her junior high graduation last year, are precious reminders of what she achieved - and everything she might have gone on to become.

482,RFK apologises after private call with Trump leaked,"Robert F Kennedy Jr has apologised after a video was leaked of a private phone call in which Donald Trump is heard apparently trying to coax the independent presidential candidate to support him. “I would love you to do something,” Trump can be heard saying in the clip. “And I think it’ll be so good for you and so big for you. And we’re going to win.” Mr Kennedy then says: “Yeah.” Trump and Mr Kennedy, a longshot third-party candidate, are political rivals who have occasionally criticised each other during the campaign. The footage is said to have been recorded on Sunday, a day before the pair met in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican convention is taking place, stoking speculation that Mr Kennedy might be about to exit the race and endorse Trump. But Kennedy spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said on Monday that he was not dropping out. Robert F Kennedy Jr posted on X on Tuesday: “When President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer. “I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted. I apologise to the president.” It was Kennedy’s son, Robert F Kennedy III, who posted the footage online early on Tuesday. The younger Kennedy said in the post on X, formerly Twitter, that he wanted to expose Trump’s “real opinion” on immunisations, but he swiftly deleted the clip. Trump can also be heard in the video discussing discredited claims about the health risks of childhood vaccines, a longstanding concern for Mr Kennedy, but one which the scientific community has said is misinformation. “I agree with you, man. Something's wrong with that whole system, and it's the doctors you find,"" Trump can be heard saying. Also on Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr, the former president’s son, was asked about rumours that Mr Kennedy could join forces with the Republican presidential nominee. Speaking at an event in Milwaukee, he said “maybe there’s a great place for him somewhere in an administration”. Mr Trump Jr said he didn’t have any “inside scoop on that, certainly not now”, but he would “love to see that happen”. Opinion polls suggest that Mr Kennedy could draw votes equally from Trump and the Democratic President Joe Biden, including in swing states, in this November's election.",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c134p2k24nzo,"Jude Sheerin,",2024-07-17 01:11:10,
483,Country star sorry for singing US anthem drunk,"Country singer Ingrid Andress has apologised and admitted being drunk while performing a much-derided rendition of the US national anthem, at a baseball stadium. Andress's erratic performance of The Star-Spangled Banner was widely shared after Major League Baseball's Home Run Derby, in Texas, on Monday. ""I was drunk last night,"" wrote Andress, who has previously received four Grammy Award nominations. ""I'm checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need. That was not me last night. I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country I love so much for that rendition."" She added: ""I'll let y'all know how rehab is - I hear it's super fun."" Andress's a-capella version of the anthem was called ""painful"" and ""one of the worst national-anthem renditions ever"", on social media. The Daily Beast headline said: ""America unites over new all-time worst national-anthem performance."" Some people posted clips of Philadelphia Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm apparently smirking as Andress was singing. But she also received sympathy and support following her apology. ""I’m so sorry you’re going through this,"" singer and actress Lucy Hale wrote. Sending you a lot of my thoughts. Take care of you and you’re going to come out of this so much stronger."" Country star Martina McBride said: ""Sending lots of love and positivity. You got this."" Singer-songwriter Julia Michaels said: ""Love you, girl. I’m sorry you’re going through this. And I’m sorry the world can be so cruel. Here for you XX."" Fellow singer-songwriter Carly Pearce said: ""Being this open takes a lot. You’ve got this. Hang in there."" And one fan posted a video of Andress on stage at a concert, to show her ""true talent"". Andress appeared as an a-cappella singer on NBC series The Sing-Off, in 2010 - and after forging a solo career, was nominated for the 2021 Grammy Award for Best New Artist. She also co-wrote Charli XCX’s hit song Boys and Bebe Rexha’s Girl in the Mirror.",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgl2gw5868o,"Ian Youngs,",2024-07-17 10:11:10,
484,Adele says she will take a 'big break' from music,"Adele has revealed she plans to take an extended break from music after her current run of concerts. ""My tank is quite empty at the minute,"" the star told German broadcaster ZDF ahead of a 10-date residency in Munich. ""I don’t have any plans for new music at all,"" she said.  ""I want a big break after all this and I think I want to do other creative things just for a little while. “You know, I don’t even sing at home at all. How strange is that?” The star's last album came out in 2021, and she has spent the past two years playing a weekend residency in Las Vegas, recently completing her 90th show at the 4,000-capacity Caesar's Palace. The show is due to conclude in November, and Adele said the experience had been emotionally draining. ""Even though it's a very manageable size of crowd, it's really been an emotional exchange,"" she said. ""I'm sure I'll feel even more like [that] every night after the shows in Munich. But it's a positive thing. It's just such an exchange of energy."" However, not every Vegas concert has gone to plan. In June, Adele angrily cursed an audience member who allegedly yelled ""Pride sucks"" during one of her shows. ""Did you come to my... show and just say that Pride sucks?"" she scolded. ""Don’t be so... ridiculous.  ""If you have nothing nice to say, shut up, all right?"" Asked about the incident, the star admitted she was easily riled up. ""Everything makes me angry,"" she told ZDF. ""Absolutely everything.  ""I'm 36 years old. I'm old and grumpy now."" Her Munich shows will be on entirely different scale to the Las Vegas residency, with 74,000 fans expected to watch her every night in a specially-built ""pop up"" stadium. The venue will also host an ""Adele experience"" featuring an English pub, a stage for a cover band and stalls selling specially designed cocktails. Organisers are also aiming to get into the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest outdoor screen of all time, measuring 220m in length. Adele posted pictures of the venue to her Instagram account on Sunday, calling the set-up ""bloody exciting"". And she told ZDF that the video installation would enhance the experience for fans. ""They just want to see your face and know it's you, so the screens are enormous."" The first show will take place on 2 August but the residency is yet to sell out, with 5% of tickets still available, according to German press agency DPA. Promoter Marek Lieberberg said the tickets at the upper and lower ends of the price range had the most availability. The cheapest tickets cost €79 (£66) and the most expensive €430 (£360). But despite all the acclaim, Adele said one of the reasons she wants to take a break from music is because of a struggle with the limelight. ""I miss everything about before I was famous, I think probably being anonymous the most,"" she said.  ""I like that I get to make music all the time, whenever I want to, and people are receptive to it and like it. That's pretty unimaginable. But the fame side of it, I absolutely hate. ""The fact that people are even interested in my songs and my voice is pretty wild. I don't think it ever gets normal. So it's worth it, the balance.""",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dm3dp9j3xo,"Mark Savage,",2024-07-17 09:11:10,
485,Toronto cleans up after severe storms cause floods,"Major motorways in Toronto have reopened and clean-up efforts are underway after a string of storms flooded parts of the city, cut power and left drivers stranded.  Nearly 5,000 customers are still without power as of Wednesday morning, according to Toronto Hydro, down from 167,000 the previous day.  Environment Canada reported that almost 100mm (4in) of rain fell on Toronto on Tuesday, surpassing the city's daily record set in 1941. Images and videos showed severe flooding across the city, cars nearly submerged, and water cascading down the staircases at Union Station, a major transit hub. The pop star Drake posted a video on Instagram which appears to show part of his Toronto home, ""The Embassy"", submerged.  ""Better be espresso martini,"" he wrote as the video showed sludgy brown water fill a room. As Toronto deals with the aftermath, city manager Paul Johnson said the focus is both on clean-up and how to rebuild the city's aging infrastructure in a flood-resilient way - a costly undertaking that would take years to complete. The challenge, Mr Johnson added, is doing this work while record-breaking storms continue to happen. He noted that Toronto had three 100-year storms in the last 11 years alone. ""The definition of them seems to have flown out the window,"" he told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday.  Tuesday's storm brought major chaos to commuters and travellers in the city.  It delayed or cancelled several flights out of Billy Bishop Airport, on the Toronto Islands in Lake Ontario. The Don Valley Parkway (DVP), a major motorway that runs adjacent to the Don river, was blocked in both directions by flooding. Ontario Highway 410 was also closed. Both have reopened as of Wednesday morning, with Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow saying in an interview with local news outlet CTV that things are ""almost back to normal"". Authorities said they rescued at least 14 people, including one person who had to be plucked from their car's roof, on Tuesday. Toronto's fire service also received more than a thousand calls from people trapped in lifts after large areas of city centre lost power during working hours. Meteorologists said that Tuesday’s record rainfall was due to three consecutive storms that fell on the city. “We had 25% more rain in three hours than we'd have normally in the whole month of July with all the thunderstorms and systems that moved through,” meteorologist Dave Phillips told local news station CP24. Mr Johnson said that parts of the city were hit with normal levels of rain, while others where deluged with ""hurricane amounts of water"". The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority warned that areas near shorelines, rivers and streams in the city are especially prone to flooding. There are more than a dozen rivers and streams in Toronto, making it vulnerable to rising water levels. Ms Chow said she did not know why the Don Valley Parkway, which is prone to flooding, was not closed earlier in the day. Toronto suffered from an intense and costly July storm in 2013 that left at least 300,000 people without power and more than 1,000 passengers needing rescue from a flooded train.",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4ypd11wr0o,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-17 17:11:10,
486,'Supermodel granny' drug extends life in animals,"A drug has increased the lifespans of laboratory animals by nearly 25%, in a discovery scientists hope can slow human ageing too. The treated mice were known as ""supermodel grannies"" in the lab because of their youthful appearance. They were healthier, stronger and developed fewer cancers than their unmedicated peers. The drug is already being tested in people, but whether it would have the same anti-ageing effect is unknown. The quest for a longer life is woven through human history. However, scientists have long known the ageing process is malleable - laboratory animals live longer if you significantly cut the amount of food they eat.  Now the field of ageing-research is booming as researchers try to uncover - and manipulate - the molecular processes of ageing.  The team at the MRC Laboratory of Medical Science, Imperial College London and Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore were investigating a protein called interleukin-11. Levels of it increase in the human body as we get older, it contributes to higher levels of inflammation, and the researchers say it flips several biological switches that control the pace of ageing.  The researchers performed two experiments.  The results, published in the journal Nature, showed lifespans were increased by 20-25% depending on the experiment and sex of the mice. Old laboratory mice often die from cancer, however, the mice lacking interleukin-11 had far lower levels of the disease. And they showed improved muscle function, were leaner, had healthier fur and scored better on many measures of frailty.  I asked one of the researchers, Prof Stuart Cook, whether the data was too good to be believed. He told me: ""I try not to get too excited, for the reasons you say, is it too good to be true?  ""There's lots of snake oil out there, so I try to stick to the data and they are the strongest out there."" He said he ""definitely"" thought it was worth trialling in human ageing, arguing that the impact ""would be transformative"" if it worked and was prepared to take it himself. The big unanswered questions are could the same effect be achieved in people, and whether any side effects would be tolerable. Interleukin-11 does have a role in the human body during early development. People are, very rarely, born unable to make it. This alters how the bones in their skull fuse together, affects their joints, which can need surgery to correct, and how their teeth emerge. It also has a role in scarring.  The researchers think that later in life, interleukin-11 is playing the bad role of driving ageing. The drug, a manufactured antibody that attacks interleukin-11, is being trialled in patients with lung fibrosis. This is where the lungs become scarred, making it harder to breathe.  Prof Cook said the trials had not been completed, however, the data suggested the drug was safe to take. This is just the latest approach to ""treating"" ageing with drugs. The type-2 diabetes drug metformin and rapamycin, which is taken to prevent an organ transplant being rejected, are both actively being researched for their anti-ageing qualities. Prof Cook thinks a drug is likely to be easier for people than calorie restriction.  ""Would you want to live from the age of 40, half-starved, have a completely unpleasant life, if you're going to live another five years at the end? I wouldn't,"" he said. Prof Anissa Widjaja, from Duke-NUS Medical School, said: “Although our work was done in mice, we hope that these findings will be highly relevant to human health, given that we have seen similar effects in studies of human cells and tissues. “This research is an important step toward better understanding ageing and we have demonstrated, in mice, a therapy that could potentially extend healthy ageing.” Ilaria Bellantuono, professor of musculoskeletal ageing at the University of Sheffield, said: “Overall, the data seems solid, this is another potential therapy targeting a mechanism of ageing, which may benefit frailty."" However, he said there were still problems, including the lack of evidence in patients and the cost of making such drugs and ""it is unthinkable to treat every 50-year-old for the rest of their life"".",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gr3x3xkno,"James Gallagher,",2024-07-17 15:11:10,
487,The Postage Stamp: A simple hole with a severe price,"The eighth at Royal Troon is the shortest hole on The Open rota Venue: Royal Troon Dates: Thu 18-Sun 21 July Coverage: Live radio and text commentary on BBC Sport website, with video clips each day. Daily highlights programme on BBC Two from 20:00 BST. Click for full details. The legend of the Postage Stamp reached a new level on Tuesday when Bryson DeChambeau, the US Open champion, spoke about the devilish little par-three eighth at Royal Troon.  It is a hole that has in past Open championships seen a one and a 15 and plenty of other numbers in between. “Well, it can be diabolical, for sure,” said the American, which was nothing unusual in itself. At 123 yards and surrounded by bunkers - one of them going by the cheery name of The Coffin - it can be utterly diabolical. What was different was the fact that at the time he was talking, DeChambeau hadn’t even set foot on it. Ever. Its reputation preceded it. He hadn’t hit one shot and yet he knew everything he needed to do there and, more importantly, everything he simply could not do. It is, of course, in the pantheon of great Open holes. A tee box atop a dune, a long and narrow green set into the side of a sandhill, five intimidating bunkers lying in wait for an errant blow, which is precisely what the wind might do at some point this week. If it does, watch out.

Small target, tiny margin for error. Seven or eight yards of width to hit into and accuracy and nerve required. It’s terrific  golf architecture, demanding course management rather than power, shot shape rather than a licence to bomb. ""Challenging a player for precision as opposed to solely length is a lost art,"" said Phil Mickelson, who came mightily close to winning a second Open here in 2016. ""The Postage Stamp is a perfect example of how you can challenge the best players in the world. I would love to see that implemented more."" Xander Schauffele, who broke his major duck at May's US PGA Championship, smiled when talking about it on Tuesday. “It's refreshing,” he said. “It's really hard. I played it for the first time today, so it’s pretty fresh in my mind. “Most of the (par three) holes we play are 255 yards. It's kind of cool to have a hole that's super scary that is that short, and I think it's going to provide a lot of entertainment if that wind picks up off the left. It's more fun than playing a 250-yard hole with no wind, but it's probably harder.” Every Open at Troon seems to add another layer to the story of the Postage Stamp.  In 1950, it was Hermann Tissies, the German amateur, who took 12 shots to find the putting surface then took three more to complete the hole. Poor Hermann was never heard of again. “It’s a simple hole but it doesn’t take much of a mistake to pay a severe price,” said Woods. The great man is living proof of that. In 1997, playing in only his third major as a professional and after shooting 64 in his third round, Woods came to grief at the Postage Stamp. He found sand and took six. The same year, the Englishman Steve Bottomley took seven on day one and 10 on day two. In practice in 2016, Rory McIlroy said it took him “five or six goes” to get out of one of the bunkers. Henrik Stenson, the stunning winner, had a similar fate in a warm-up that year. He eventually kicked it out. “I get frustrated sometimes when the solution to distance is just making holes further and further,” said world number one Scottie Scheffler. “Number eight is a good little way to almost step back in time and control your ball a bit more. You don't have to make a par three 230 yards to make it a great hole. It can be 120 yards. Like 12 at Augusta and 17 at Sawgrass, the best par threes in the world are short par threes. “It leaves a lot of opportunity for you to hit a shot. If I don't hit the green on eight, it's most likely going to be a bogey unless you're in the front of the green. If you hit it in the left bunker you're going to be glad to be making a bogey because it's probably going to plug. “Great short holes like that are fun. It's an underrated skill for guys nowadays to be able to control your ball and it's something we need to encourage in our game, not just building golf courses longer and longer.” Colin Montgomerie, a local boy who went on to achieve great things in the game, once spoke about the genius of of the Postage Stamp.  ""Even in a practice round you stand up there and it's a potential card-wrecker,"" he said. ""Always was and always will be. It's amazing how one can design a course back in the 1870s and it still stands the test of time today. Fantastic. Nearly 150 years old and it can still generate excitement and drama."" Can and will. There are so many unknowns about where the Claret Jug is heading on Sunday but the Postage Stamp’s capacity to make it interesting is as relevant now as it ever was.",2024-07-17 23:11:10,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c4ngw2x812go,Tom English,2024-07-17 23:11:10,
488,Musk to move SpaceX and X HQ over gender identity law,"Billionaire Elon Musk has said he will move the headquarters of two of his most high-profile companies, rocket firm SpaceX and social media platform X, from California to Texas. He said the move was due to recent laws passed by the state - in particular a new law which prevents schools from making rules requiring staff tell anyone, including parents, information about a child's gender identity. A spokesperson for the governor said the law keeps ""children safe while protecting the critical role of parents"". But Mr Musk called it ""the last straw"" in a post on his social media platform.  The billionaire previously moved Tesla's headquarters to Texas in 2021 and he is a resident of the state - which has no income tax. The issue of what schools should tell parents about their children's gender identities has become a major topic of debate in the US. LGBTQ advocates say students have a right to privacy, but others argue parents have a right to know what is happening with their children.  ""It protects the child-parent relationship by preventing politicians and school staff from inappropriately intervening in family matters and attempting to control if, when, and how families have deeply personal conversations,"" Brandon Richards told the Associated Press.  Mr Musk, who has a transgender daughter, has previously said he ""supports trans"" while expressing impatience with pronouns - calling them an ""aesthetic nightmare"". The billionaire's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson filed to cut ties with him in 2022. She said she no longer wanted to ""be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form"" when applying to legally change her name and gender. Last year, Mr Musk said he would lobby to criminalise transgender medical treatment. ""Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday, noting that he had previously expressed his opposition to the bill. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticised Mr Musk's decision on social media.  “You bent the knee,” he posted, along with a screenshot of a 2022 post from Donald Trump which said Mr Musk would ""drop to [his] knees and beg"" if he asked. States have historically competed aggressively to woo companies to establish headquarters, bringing with them high-paying corporate jobs.  SpaceX, which employs more than 5,000 people in California, according to state records, also already has a large base of operations in Texas.  In response to Mr Musk's pledge, Greg Abbott, governor for Texas, said: ""This cements Texas as the leader in space exploration."" Neither SpaceX nor X responded to requests for comment about whether the decision to move headquarters would lead to job cuts in California.  The move comes after Mr Musk formally endorsed Donald Trump for president following the assassination attempt on him on Saturday. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Mr Musk would be directing $45m a month toward his campaign. Mr Musk responded on X with a meme implying the report was false, though he later seemed to suggest there was some truth to the claim by responding positively to a post claiming he was pledging millions of dollars to help Trump get elected.

489,Fernandez faces disciplinary action over alleged racist chant,"Enzo Fernandez joined Chelsea from Benfica for £107m in 2023 Chelsea have begun disciplinary proceedings against midfielder Enzo Fernandez after he posted a video on social media that the French Football Federation said included an alleged ""racist and discriminatory"" chant. On Tuesday the FFF said it would file a complaint to world governing body Fifa over the video featuring a song sung by some of the Argentina squad about France's black players. Fernandez's Chelsea team-mate Wesley Fofana, who has one cap for France, posted an image of the video on Instagram, describing it as ""uninhibited racism"". Fernandez - a £107m British record signing in February 2023 - said he is ""truly sorry"" for the video he posted as Argentina celebrated winning the Copa America. Fifa is also investigating the video, in which several members of the Argentina squad take part in a song originally sung by Argentina fans questioning the heritage of France's black and mixed race players. Chelsea have seven France players who are black or mixed race in their first-team squad - Fofana, Axel Disasi, Benoit Badiashile, Lesley Ugochukwu, Christopher Nkunku, Malo Gusto and Malang Sarr. ""The song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words,"" said Fernandez. ""I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations. ""That video, that moments, those words, do not reflect my beliefs or my character."" A Chelsea statement read: ""We acknowledge and appreciate our player’s public apology and will use this as an opportunity to educate. ""The club has instigated an internal disciplinary procedure."" The FFF will contact the Argentine Football Association (AFA) about the live video posted on social media by Fernandez after Argentina beat Colombia 1-0 in the Copa America final on Sunday. A statement from the FFF, external said president Philippe Diallo ""condemns in the strongest terms the unacceptable and discriminatory remarks that were made against the players of the French team"". It added: ""Faced with the seriousness of these shocking remarks, contrary to the values of sport and human rights, the president of the FFF decided to directly appeal to his Argentine counterpart and Fifa and to file a legal complaint for racially offensive and discriminatory remarks."" The Argentine FA has been approached for comment. France beat Argentina in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup, and Argentina beat France in the final of the 2022 World Cup. A Fifa spokesperson said they were ""aware of a video circulating on social media"" and ""the incident is being looked into"". They added: ""Fifa strongly condemns any form of discrimination by anyone including players, fans and officials."" Chelsea said they find ""all forms of discriminatory behaviour completely unacceptable"". They added: ""We are proud to be a diverse, inclusive club where people from all cultures, communities and identities feel welcome."" Fernandez's Chelsea team-mate David Datro Fofana urged action by everyone in football in the ""fight"" against racism. ""The football that I like is multi-ethnic,"" posted the Ivorian forward on Instagram. ""Racism in all its forms should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. These acts have no place in football or even anywhere else.  ""This fight really needs to be taken seriously be everyone in this sport."" Fofana is currently training with Chelsea after his loan spell with Burnley last season, while fellow Blues striker Nicolas Jackson has also published a post on Instagram in support of Fernandez. Jackson's post showed the Argentina midfielder playing with a young black child during the club's pre-season US tour last year. Former Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano, who is the coach of the nation's Olympic football team, said the video was ""taken out of context"" and his country is ""totally inclusive"". The 40-year-old, whose side will play at this summer's Games in Paris, also said Fernandez is a ""great guy"".  Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out, meanwhile, said the video is ""unacceptable"". ""We stand with and show our full support to Wesley Fofana after he responded publicly and brought it to wider attention,"" it added. ""Several players are seen singing the song, which means there will be a wider impact on team-mates and fans at other clubs. ""We call upon all relevant clubs, the Argentina federation and Fifa to address this concerning issue with empathy, sensitivity and understanding. ""Responses to these incidents cannot start and end with an apology. More important is the action taken afterwards to ensure players are educated and held accountable, both in England and on a global scale."" Those comments were echoed by fellow anti-discrimination organisation Show Racism the Red Card, which said ""words are not enough"". ""The racism by the Argentina players is abhorrent, disgraceful and, to record it on social media, it's unbelievable to think it was amusing or even they would get away with it,"" said chief executive Ged Grebby. ""It's good they haven't but we want to see action taken, rather than players saying just they are sorry. That's not good enough. ""The damage has been done. Not just to black players in the Premier League but black players in our society. ""Words are not enough and if Chelsea are serious about anti-racism education we urge them to contact Show Racism the Red Card and get this player to come and work with us in schools. ""It would make a huge impact. Rather than banning this player for whatever number of games, let's get him involved in an anti-racism programme, a positive programme, with Show Racism the Red Card.""

494,Why Stokes' bowling is already impressing - Finn column,"Ben Stokes does not do things by halves. When the England captain was 10 overs into a spell on the evening of day two of the first Test against West Indies, my left knee and I were wincing. I had memories of me coming back from my first knee surgery, after returning home early from the Ashes series in 2017-18. In all honesty, I was never the same bowler after it.  My inability to consistently brace my knee at the point my front foot hit the floor led to me being down on pace, down on consistency and down on confidence for the rest of my career.  After my third knee surgery at the close of the 2022 season and an unsuccessful reintroduction to bowling halfway through 2023, I gave up the ghost and retired from cricket, having chased my tail for the previous six seasons trying to rediscover the snap and bite I had prior to my first knee surgery. This makes it even more impressive to see Stokes running in with such vigour and intent after his most recent knee surgery. I watched closely when he brought himself on to bowl. Usually you can't take your eyes off the game when Stokes is involved because of the propensity for things to happen.  But, as a former knee injury sufferer, I was particularly intrigued to see how he got on with the ball in hand. The first thing you look for is whether there is anything within the technique that looks different.  I used to have a few videos of me at my best and would always compare and see if I could replicate those from before my first surgery. I never truly did. I had one from behind so I could see the height of my arm and one from the side so that I could see if my leg was bracing and at what stage it was bracing. At Lord's, when Stokes' left heel was striking the ground in his delivery stride, his left knee was bracing and locking out.  This braced leg then acted as a pivot for the rest of his body to contort over with his bowling arm up high in his unique 'beyond the perpendicular' style.  The right hip and right knee then drove hard towards the target of off stump and the ball was released from his hand with swing, zip and control.  I wasn't particularly looking at the speed gun when he was bowling, I was looking at how braced that front knee was and how much he was committing to each delivery at the crease.  I was very enthused by what I saw. Exciting time to be a fast bowler - Stokes Pope on captaincy, batting at three and white-ball ambitions England expect Windies response - Crawley This video can not be played Stokes traps McKenzie lbw for a duck It was that confidence in my body that eluded me and was hard to rediscover. I saw a man bowling with no such worries. Without a braced front knee the kinetic energy within that process is lost and the ball is released without the same zip and nip you hear bowlers talk about.  This is the key part to Stokes having the same impact with the ball that we have seen over the course of his career when he has been fully fit. Stokes looked as fit and lean as I’ve ever seen him.  By all accounts, on his path back to bowling, he has been unbelievably dedicated to making sure he is in prime physical condition so as to fulfil his true all-rounder status within the team.  When you carry extra weight it means you are putting unnecessary kilograms though your joints and can cause no end of problems.  Stokes will not suffer as a result of this. It is no secret that, even with the introduction of impressive bowlers such as Gus Atkinson who bowled beautifully and looked every inch a Test fast bowler at Lord’s for his 12 wickets, a fully fit Stokes holds the key to this England team fulfilling their potential and beating India in the summer of 2025 and Australia in the Ashes at the end of that year.  These series usually define a captain's tenure.  Stokes' dedication to making sure he is fully fit and bowling again is a nod towards knowing this. The bowling part of his game is back and that is great news for England fans, team-mates and administrators alike.  He does not do things by halves.

493,'Argentina song stained glory of Copa victory',"Argentina were celebrating their Copa America final win over Colombia Argentina won the Copa America, but lost the respect of many with the manner of their celebration. Midfielder Enzo Fernandez faces disciplinary proceedings at Chelsea after posting a video on social media that the French Football Federation said included alleged ""racist and discriminatory language"". Fifa is also investigating the video, in which several members of the Argentina squad - celebrating their 1-0 win over Colombia in the final - take part in a song originally sung by Argentina fans questioning the heritage of France's black and mixed-race players. The global repercussions of that song have sparked a reaction from the Argentine government. Javier Milei's right-wing administration has no natural sympathy for anything that might be considered 'woke'. But Julio Garro, the under-secretary for sports, suggested that team captain Lionel Messi and local FA president Claudio Tapia should issue an apology for the song that some were singing on the bus on Sunday night. ""It's left us looking bad,"" he said. Others, however, have rejected the need for an apology. With monotonous and depressing regularity, when teams from Argentina play opponents from Brazil in continental club competitions, there are scenes in the stands of Argentine fans making monkey gestures. When interviewed, the perpetrators vehemently deny that they are racists. They are indulging in 'banter'. All is fair, they argue, in love, war and football. Anything that goads and irritates the opposition is fair game. And on this latest matter, such sentiments are widespread. The attempts from Argentine clubs to crack down on this behaviour have often been half-hearted, with references to 'xenophobia' - instead of calling it what it is: racism. Especially depressing is the fact that this behaviour has been exhibited by some of the players. Here there is no excuse. With the exception of one of the substitute goalkeepers, the entire squad is based in Europe. These players are part of multi-national, multi-cultural, multi-racial squads. They should know much better. Quite apart from any possible sanctions, there could be some very awkward dressing-room moments when they report back for pre-season training. Enzo Fernandez apologised after posting a video on social media that the French Football Federation said included an alleged ""racist and discriminatory"" chant One of the attractions of national team duty for these players is the chance to be together with people from their own culture, and sing their own songs. It is a chance for them to be aggressively and assertively Argentine. Many aspects of the country's fan culture are wonderful. The songs can be hypnotic.    But the lyrics to this particular song, which grew out of the Qatar World Cup final, which Argentina won on penalties against France, are extremely disturbing. The Argentine players risk not only insulting their black team-mates and fans. These songs insult their own heritage. It is rare these days to see a black Argentine. But that has not always been the case.  Going back to the days of Spanish colonial rule, the country imported far fewer enslaved Africans than neighbouring Brazil, and put an end to slavery decades earlier. But around two hundred years ago, Buenos Aires was a third black. Argentina fans celebrated on the streets of Buenos Aires after beating Colombia in the Copa America final There are many theories, ranging from outbreaks of yellow fever to deaths in the war for independence. The most coherent idea, though, is simply that they were swamped by the millions of immigrants pouring in from Europe and the Middle East (especially Italy - Argentines speak Spanish with an Italian intonation) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The African influence is there in the gene pool. Dark-skinned people are often nicknamed 'el negro' - which carries no negative connotation. African influence has left its mark. Argentina's most significant cultural product is tango. The word is African, and the music and dance, like so many genres of the Americas, are the consequence of the mix of African, European and indigenous styles. Because of its socially lowly origins, tango was looked down upon by the Argentine elite, seen as a vulgar phenomenon - until it took Paris by storm in the early 20th century and was thus legitimised. Incidentally, it is interesting that (just like samba in Brazil), tango in Argentina moved in the opposite direction from football. The musical genre began at the bottom of society and moved up, where football started with the elites and moved down. This video can not be played At an emotional news conference in March, Brazil winger Vinicius Jr said he felt ""less and less"" like playing football because of the repeated racist abuse he has suffered A friend of mine is a black Uruguayan sociologist. You might expect him to have a good radar for these things, and he lived for years in Buenos Aires without experiencing the slightest problem. On the other hand, the mere presence of so many European immigrants in the south cone of South America was an explicitly racist project. At the time, there was a fashion for eugenic ideas - the belief that some 'races' were superior to others. South American leaders sought to 'improve' and 'civilise' their countries through importing a white labour force. The very presence, then, of so many European descendants in Argentina is the consequence of racist thinking. The idea of a hierarchy of races has never entirely gone away, and has emerged in all its horror in the lyrics of the song with which some of the Argentina players stained their glory on Sunday.

Postecoglou, 58, insisted he is only focused on being the Spurs boss following Gareth Southgate's resignation on Tuesday. Southgate, who was appointed in 2016 and had five months left on his deal with England, stood down less than 48 hours after Spain beat the Three Lions in the Euro 2024 final. ""I've got no idea, I've been preparing for a game,"" Postecoglou told BBC Scotland when asked about the links after his side's 5-1 pre-season victory over Hearts. ""I'm the Tottenham manager.

491,Yoro set for Man Utd medical before £52m move,"Leny Yoro made his Lille debut at the age of 16 Manchester United are closing in on signing Lille defender Leny Yoro. Sources say United have agreed a 62m-euro (£52.06m) fee for Yoro, who is due to fly to Manchester today for a medical. The 18-year-old has attracted significant interest from a number of top European clubs, with Real Madrid repeatedly mentioned as one of the sides keen to sign the player. Yoro, who made his Lille debut at the age of 16, was picked in Thierry Henry’s provisional France squad for the Olympic Games but was omitted from the final party due to Lille's participation in the Champions League qualification rounds.  His arrival would bring some clarity to United’s central defensive group. The club have lodged two bids with Everton for Jarrad Branthwaite but both have been rejected by the Merseyside club as they fall well short of their valuation, which sources have said is in excess of £75m. United have also been negotiating with Bayern Munich for their Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt. Sources say while the club remain interested in Branthwaite and De Ligt, they would not sign both and further signings are likely to depend on squad space and available funds. Raphael Varane left the club at the end of the season and there are doubts over the future of Sweden’s Victor Lindelof, whose contract expires next year. Harry Maguire was the subject of bids from rival Premier League clubs last summer but opted to remain at Old Trafford and eventually made 22 Premier League appearances. Joshua Zirkzee, 23, became the club's first signing of the summer last week when he arrived in a £36.5m deal from Italian side Bologna. United have agreed a £27m fee with French club Marseille for striker Mason Greenwood, while defender Willy Kambwala left United to join La Liga outfit Villarreal last week for a fee of around £9m.

492,Man Utd forward Greenwood set for Marseille medical,"Mason Greenwood scored 10 goals in all competitions on loan at Getafe last season Mason Greenwood is due to have a medical before completing a permanent move from Manchester United to Marseille. Sources have said forward Greenwood has agreed personal terms, with a fee, including add-ons, of more than 30m euros (£25.2m) in place around a contract that is set to run to 2029. United have negotiated what they regard as a significant sell-on clause. Marseille were criticised by the city mayor last week when their intentions became apparent. However, it appears they are undeterred and Greenwood is now expected to become part of Roberto de Zerbi’s squad for the coming campaign. Greenwood has not played for United since January 2022. Serious charges against him, including attempted rape and assault, were dropped in February 2023. United sources said the 22-year-old briefly met senior club officials last week, when it was confirmed the club stance remained for the player to be sold. The Old Trafford club have added Netherlands forward Joshua Zirkzee to their squad this month, with the fee for a homegrown player helping to ease slightly what is acknowledged to be a ‘tight’ financial position as United look to meet the Premier League’s profit and sustainability regulations. Greenwood is set to fill the void left by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who announced his departure from the Ligue 1 side on social media. ""Merci Marseille,"" Aubameyang wrote on Instagram.

506,Super Bowl winner 'wrongly handcuffed' on United flight,"United Airlines has apologised to NFL Hall of Fame legend Terrell Davis after the two-time Super Bowl champion said he was ""wrongly handcuffed"" on a flight to California. Mr Davis said he was removed from a United Airlines aircraft last Saturday after a flight attendant accused the former Denver Broncos star of hitting him. The 51-year-old, who was flying with his family from Denver, spoke about his ordeal on social media. He said the claim was false and described feeling ""traumatised"" by it. United Airlines told the BBC it had removed the flight attendant from duty while it investigates the matters and reviews its policies. Posting on his Instagram, Mr Davis released a statement explaining that during the flight's beverage service his son had asked for a cup of ice.  In an effort to get his son the ice, Mr Davis said he ""lightly tapped"" the flight attendant on the arm to get his attention, only to hear him respond, ""Don't hit me!"" The flight attendant then left the cart and went to the front of the plane, according to the Instagram account. ""I was confused, as were the passengers in front of me who witnessed the exchange, Mr Davis wrote. ""I thought nothing of it other than this particular employee was incredibly rude and blatantly wrong in his accusations of me hitting him.” Mr Davis said that when the plane arrived at Orange County's John Wayne Airport, he and other passengers were told to remain seated. FBI agents and local authorities then boarded the plane, placed him in handcuffs in front of his wife and three children and then removed him from the flight. He said the ""entire flight of passengers watched in silence"". A United Airlines spokeswoman told the BBC the company has apologised to Mr Davis and continues to discuss the incident with him. ""This is clearly not the kind of travel experience we strive to provide,"" she said. ""We have removed the flight attendant from duty while we closely look into this matter and we are reviewing our policies around incidents like this."" Mr Davis was a star running back for the Denver Broncos, playing for them from 1995 to 2001.

According to the prosecutor's office, Mr Leake, a former paratrooper and musician, tried to sell drugs he had obtained from an accomplice between January and June 2023.  It was not clear how Mr Leake, who is one of about a dozen Americans currently held in Russian detention, pleaded.  Washington has urged its citizens to leave Russia immediately, citing the threat of arrest amid the highest tensions between the two countries since the Cold War. Mr Leake was accused of packaging the drugs for sale before giving them to another defendant in the case, a Russian woman named Veronika Grabanchuk.  Citing the investigation, Russian news agency Interfax reported that both Mr Leake and Ms Grabanchuk made four attempts to sell over 40g of mephedrone.  ""In addition, Leake stored more than 1.6g of mephedrone and 0.54g of pills containing the narcotic drug MDMA at his apartment on Zaporozhskaya Street without the intention of selling them. The drugs were found and seized during operational activities,"" the report added. In June, Russian state television broadcast footage from Mr Leake's trial that showed him locked in a metal cage. In a separate video shared online, he said he ""didn't know"" why he was detained. Appearing confused, he said he did not believe he had done what he was accused of, because he did not know what the charges were. In Russia, only 0.25% of all cases referred to court in 2018 ended with not-guilty verdicts. By comparison, the rate from 2017 to 2018 in UK magistrates' courts was approximately 15%, rising to 20% at Crown Court level. Mr Leake is at least the third American detained in Russia in recent years amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow. A musician and music producer in his early 50's, Mr Leake was a member of Lovi Noch, meaning catch the night, an ""American fronted rock band"" based in Moscow.  He is reported to have lived in Russia for many years.  US media outlet CNN reported that he appeared on the travel show Parts Unknown - hosted by the late chef Anthony Bourdain - for an episode in 2014 that was filmed in Moscow and St Petersburg. Darya Tarasova, who produced the episode, told CNN that Mr Leake was a ""showman"" who was ""very articulate"" and who ""loved Russia"". He often worked with local rock bands, Ms Tarasova said. Russian local media had earlier reported his arrest at his flat in Moscow. US officials have previously accused Russia of deliberately targeting American citizens for arrest. In March, Russian authorities arrested US journalist Evan Gershkovich, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, on espionage charges. He remains in pre-trial detention. Mr Gershkovich's trial started in June and closing arguments are scheduled for Friday.  Late last year, American basketball player Brittney Griner, who was jailed in Russia on drugs charges, was released in a prisoner swap for the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.

501,Bangladesh issues high security alert as deadly protests escalate,"A High Security Alert has been issued for the whole of Bangladesh, as violent clashes between students and police continue.  The capital Dhaka is in the midst of a near-total internet blackout, with phone lines also down.  On Thursday evening, several thousand protestors stormed the state broadcaster BTV, vandalising furniture, smashing windows and lights and setting parts of it on fire. Bangladesh's information minister told the BBC that broadcasts had been stopped and most employees had left the building in the capital. A post on BTV's official Facebook page had earlier warned ""many"" were trapped inside the building, and appealed for help from the fire service to put the blaze out. A senior BTV journalist, who didn’t want to be named, told the BBC: ""The situation was so bad we didn’t have any other option but to leave the place. Some of our colleagues were trapped inside. I don’t know what happened to them."" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on the network on Wednesday night, appealing for calm after days of violent protests which have left at least 19 people dead, possibly many more, and hundreds injured. Students have been holding rallies demanding change to a system which reserves a third of public sector jobs for the relatives of veterans of the country’s war for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The students are arguing that the system is discriminatory, asking for recruitment based on merit. The government has been trying to quell the protests, on Thursday switching off the country's mobile internet in an attempt to slow the students. Instead, it became the deadliest day so far, according to news agency AFP. According to its count citing hospitals, a total of 32 people have died during the protests.  The BBC's Bengali service has confirmed 19 deaths so far - 13 of them on Thursday. Among the dead was a 32-year-old journalist for the Dhaka Times. Sheikh Hasina had condemned protesters' deaths as ""murder"" in her Wednesday television appearance, but her words were largely dismissed by protest organisers, who rejected government offers of talks.  ""The government has killed so many people in a day that we cannot join any discussions in the current circumstances,"" said Nahid Iqbal, a leader of the anti-quota protest.  Another student, Aleem Khan, 22, told the BBC: ""The Prime Minister is asking for an end to the violence with one hand whilst, with the other hand, attacking students using pro-ruling party groups and the police."" Thursday saw tear gas and rubber bullets deployed by officers, as students created human blockades in the streets. The students who stormed BTV had earlier ""torched"" a police station, according to an official at the network. ""They chased the police officers when they took refuge at the BTV office,"" the official told AFP. ""Angry protesters then caused mayhem here."" Elsewhere, BBC Bengali spoke to a group of medical students who were taking shelter inside a medical college compound after they were attacked by pro-ruling party groups. One of the students, Sumi, told the BBC: “I am here to protest against discrimination within the civil service and now that so many students have been killed by the police, I am also protesting against that.  ""Our protest is peaceful, but the way in which we were attacked made me feel like we were going to be killed by pro-ruling party groups.""",2024-07-18 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5g9xd9rrwo,"Flora Drury and Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-18 20:10:07,
502,Trump gunman flagged by Secret Service 20 minutes before shooting,"A counter sniper flagged a suspicious man using a rangefinder to the US Secret Service some 20 minutes before a gunman opened fire at a Donald Trump rally, according to members of Congress briefed by law enforcement.  A clearer timeline of the events leading up to the assassination attempt has begun to emerge after closed briefings to lawmakers on Wednesday.  Local police had initially spotted the gunman, who was acting strangely, at Saturday's Pennsylvania rally about an hour before the shooting, according to the briefings.  They lost him in the crowd before he was spotted again by the counter sniper. The new information has raised more questions about why Trump's would-be assassin was not stopped sooner and why the former president was allowed to appear on the rally stage.  Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old suspected gunman, was reportedly spotted early by local police, who flagged him as a skinny young man who was behaving in a suspicious manner.  They notified other police agencies, including the Secret Service, via radio. At the time, Crooks did not appear to have a weapon. They then lost track of him.  “He was identified as a character of suspicion because [he had] a rangefinder as well as a backpack. And this was over an hour before the shooting actually occurred,” Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, who was present at the briefings, told Fox News. “So, you would think over the course of that hour, you shouldn’t lose sight of the individual.” Later, around 17:45 local time, Crooks was spotted again, this time by a counter sniper officer around the Agr International building - the one the gunman later scaled up to aim at Trump.  The officer reportedly took a picture of the gunman looking through the rangefinder, according to  CBS News, the BBC's news partner, and immediately radioed to a command post to report the sighting. By 17:52 - 19 minutes before the shooting - the Secret Service was made aware that Crooks was spotted with a rangefinder, and disseminated that information to other officers on site, CBS reported. A rangefinder is an instrument that can be used to help measure the distance to a target.  It was also revealed during the briefings that the gunman had visited the site of the attack, the Butler County fairgrounds, at least once in the days before the assassination attempt and had previously searched on his phone for symptoms of a depressive disorder, an official familiar with the briefing told CBS. The attacker had also used his phone to search for images of both Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. FBI Director Wray told lawmakers on the call that more than 200 interviews had already been conducted and 14,000 images reviewed. Crooks fired at Trump shortly after he began speaking at the rally at 18:11. One rallygoer was killed in the shooting and two others were injured. Trump was wounded in the ear.  Crooks was killed by Secret Service snipers within 26 seconds of opening fire. In the briefing with law enforcement agencies, multiple Republican senators criticised the lack of transparency from investigators and expressed outrage that Trump was allowed to take the stage even after a threat was identified. ""I am appalled to learn that the Secret Service knew about a threat prior to President Trump walking on stage,"" tweeted Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Some senators who participated in the call demanded the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle. ""The egregious security failures and lack of transparency around the assassination attempt on President Trump demand an immediate change of leadership at the Secret Service,"" tweeted Utah Senator Mike Lee. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after the call that ""the nation deserves answers and accountability"" and a change in leadership at Secret Service would be ""an important step in that direction"". House lawmakers similarly were briefed on Wednesday by law enforcement about security and what led up to the Saturday shooting.  Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also called for Ms Cheatle to quit. He said he plans to open an investigation in the House. ""It'll be comprised of Republicans and Democrats to get down to the bottom of this quickly, so the American people can get the answers that they deserve,"" he told Fox News. FBI Director Chris Wray, who participated in the calls, told lawmakers that no motive has yet been identified for the gunman. Ms Cheatle, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service, is due to testify next week to the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee and House Homeland Security Committee. She also gave a private, in-person briefing on Tuesday to Trump in Milwaukee regarding the assassination attempt, CBS reported, citing a person familiar with the meeting.  Ms Cheatle had previously said that the agency relied on local police to secure the building where the gunman climbed to the roof with his firearm. Local law enforcement, however, had told Secret Service that they did not have enough resources to secure that building, according to Richard Goldinger, the district attorney in Butler County, where the rally took place.  A local officer did come face-to-face with the gunman on the roof moments before the attack, Butler Township Manager Tom Knights told CBS.  The officer was searching after reports about a suspicious person. He was hoisted on to the roof by another officer and saw the suspect pointing a weapon directly at him, Mr Knights said.  The officer was in a ""defenceless"" position and let go, falling to the ground. He then alerted others to the gunman. Moments later, the shooting started.  Jason Russell, a former Secret Service agent who has worked at campaigned rallies, said the disaster at last week’s rally likely resulted from a miscommunication about different officials’ responsibilities. “It seems to me like there was just a miscommunication, but the reality is, if it's a Secret Service event, anything that happens is our fault,"" he told the BBC. Mr Russell added he would have at least placed an obstacle between the building from where the gunman fired and where Trump was delivering his speech to block the line of sight. The attack is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, and President Biden said he would direct an independent review be opened.",2024-07-18 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51ydg792ggo,"Max Matza and Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-18 18:10:07,

498,UFC boss to promote Trump's 'fighter' image at RNC finale,"The president of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) will take the stage on Thursday night before Donald Trump - days after an assassination attempt - officially accepts the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has embraced Dana White, one of his most outspoken supporters outside of politics, and the hugely popular combat sports franchise he manages, gracing several of its live events over the past year while grappling with court battles. With an unfiltered and unorthodox style similar to Trump's, the UFC boss will now act as frontman, introducing his long-time friend as the finale of the Republican National Convention. Their friendship dates back to at least 2001. Back then, Mr White - an Irish-American college dropout turned boxercise instructor - had gone from managing two mixed martial arts (MMA) champions to becoming UFC president. MMA had been facing a downturn. After then-US Senator John McCain labelled it ""human cockfighting"" and led a campaign to ban the UFC, its events were consigned to small markets. ""This brand was so bad, venues didn't even want us. Arenas didn't want us,"" Mr White said in 2022. But after New Jersey legalised the sport in 2000, he continued, ""Trump literally called us. He said 'Come to my place, do the event here. We'll have you at the Trump Taj Mahal'."" The now-defunct casino and hotel in Atlantic City went on to host the UFC 31 and UFC 32 MMA events, with Trump showing up for the first fight and staying until the last on both occasions, according to Mr White. Both events boosted the company's profile and helped it secure larger venues for future events. Now the largest MMA promotion in the world, the UFC is currently valued at $12.3bn (£9.5bn). And Mr White has stayed loyal to Trump through his evolution from business to politics. Stumping for his friend at the RNC in 2016, he praised him in a short but fiery speech as ""a hard worker"" with ""great business instincts"". ""I know fighters,"" he said. ""Donald Trump is a fighter, and I know he will fight for this country.” Endorsing him again at the 2020 RNC, he championed Trump's record in office and said it was ""critically important to re-elect"" him. Brash and uncensored in both language and manner, the UFC chief has said he ""does not give a [expletive]"" about mixing business and politics. No stranger to controversy himself, he admitted last year to slapping his wife after a drunken altercation at a New Year's Eve party was caught on video. He has since apologised. As Trump faced criminal, civil and other legal challenges in his post-presidency, he has been Mr White's guest at multiple special events. In the past year, Trump has attended at least four such events, often making fighter-style entrances with background music and an entourage. His last scheduled appearance was scuttled this past Saturday by the attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania rally. The UFC is replete with fighters who speak out in support of traditionally conservative values, including several self-described ""pro-American patriots"".  Although it includes female fighters, the sport represents a hyper-masculinity that is arguably a good fit for the image generated by the Trump campaign. Each time Trump has been received with thunderous ovations from clearly partisan crowds and taken VIP seats close to the octagon, or main fighting ring. But he likely cannot replicate this growing love affair in other sports arenas, including those with Trump friendly audiences like Nascar and the PGA Tour, and the previously Trump-friendly WWE. The failed assassination attempt on Trump has meanwhile reinforced his friend's support for his re-election. ""Everybody wants to act like the tough guy. But when the [expletive] goes down, you find out who the tough guys are and who the tough guys are not,"" Mr White told The Pat McAfee Show this week. ""This guy is the legitimate, ultimate, American badass of all time."" Media reports indicate that Trump has rewritten Thursday's nomination speech following Saturday's shooting to make an explicit call for unity. But if Mr White's previous convention speeches are any indication, his introduction to the main event may not strike the same conciliatory tone. The convention will also hear from controversial pro-wrestling legend Hulk Hogan. And, as one Trump surrogate put it, the former president's walk onto the stage is going to be like ""Hogan at Wrestlemania"".",2024-07-18 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng948r84go,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-18 19:10:07,
497,Trump to address buoyant Republicans in first speech since shooting,"Donald Trump will address a celebratory Republican convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, where he is expected to formally accept the presidential nomination and bring to a close a four-day event that has underscored his total dominance of the party. The former president, 78, will deliver his primetime speech while riding a wave of momentum that has grown since Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance last month and some more recent court rulings in his favour. It is also his first speech since he survived an assassination attempt at a rally on Saturday, which left him bloodied after a gunman shot in his direction as he delivered remarks on an outdoor stage. Lara Trump told the BBC's US news partner CBS that her father-in-law was affected by his ""near death experience"" and that will be reflected in his address. She said Americans may see a ""different version"" of him on Thursday. The convention in Wisconsin has been a family affair for the Trumps, with Lara Trump among the broad mix of relatives to have spoken or appeared in the arena's VIP box. The messaging has been consistent, with an apparent campaign effort to present a softer Trump with repeated anecdotes presenting him as a family man and unifying figure. That has not gone unnoticed by critics, with some senior Democrats pushing back on this message. “In recent days, they’ve been trying to portray themselves as the party of unity,"" Vice-President Kamala Harris said of the convention on Thursday. “You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity and dignity,"" she said. After he takes the stage on Thursday night, the former president will share his vision to ""usher in a new golden age for America"", according to the party.  It will cap off a week of speeches from Republican politicians, including Trump's former primary rivals, delegates and governors.  Trump told the Washington Examiner newspaper on Sunday that he decided to rewrite his speech in the wake of the assassination attempt, switching from attacks on President Joe Biden's policies to a message of unity. ""It’s going to be a whole different speech now,"" he said.  “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he added.  One rally attendee was killed in the Saturday shooting and two were badly injured. Trump was shot in the ear.  He has received repeated praise from Republican attendees this week, including some who greeted in the him in the convention centre with tears in their eyes, and others wearing fake ear bandages to express solidarity after the shooting. A unity message from Trump would be a departure from the strong rhetoric he's often used on the campaign trail, where he has railed against ""communists, Marxist, fascists and the radical left thugs"".  Even with this altered message, he is still likely, as his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance did on Wednesday night, to criticise President Biden and his record. Mr Vance assailed “career politicians” like Mr Biden in his speech.  Several other high-profile names are expected to take the stage on Thursday, including Eric Trump, the former president's son, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump will be introduced by his friend, Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Wrestler Hulk Hogan will also speak ahead of Trump formally accepting his third consecutive Republican nomination. Trump's wife Melania and daughter Ivanka are also set to appear at the convention for the first time. The evening session of the convention is expected to begin at around 17:45 CST (23:45 BST), with Trump’s speech lasting until potentially 22:30 CST.  President Biden, meanwhile, has had to pause campaign stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, after testing positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. He is experiencing mild symptoms, the White House said.  Mr Biden is under increasing pressure to step aside after reports emerged on Wednesday that both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries privately urged him to end his re-election campaign.  Polls indicate Mr Biden is trailing the former president in several crucial swing states.

496,"American comedian Bob Newhart dead at 94, publicist says","American stand-up comedy legend Bob Newhart, whose deadpan delivery style earned him numerous awards, has died at the age of 94. The star of TV series The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart passed away at home after a series of short illnesses, his publicist said in a statement provided to the BBC on Thursday. Newhart became a stand-up comic after starting his career as an accountant in Chicago. He went on to guest-host Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show 87 times. More recently, he starred in classic Christmas film Elf and The Big Bang Theory. The son of a plumber in a suburb of Chicago, Newhart graduated with a business degree from Loyola University in 1952. He served in the Army for two years during the Korean War then enrolled in a graduate law school before dropping out. He and a friend began recording improvised comedy routines shortly after. In 1959, he was discovered by a local DJ who recommended him to the newly formed Warner Bros Records. His live recording from a Houston comedy club, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, went on to become the first comedy album to top the charts. Seven more albums were released after that, with millions of copies sold. His longtime publicist, Jerry Digney, wrote in a statement announcing his death that Newhart began his career “toiling in Chicago as an accountant by day and moonlighting at night as a comedy performer and writer”. Newhart was known as a pioneer of stand-up routines involving long stories, with a series of funny statements throughout, rather one single punchline joke at the end. “There was a (comedy) sea change taking place,” he said, according to his publicist. Newhart separated himself from other comedians of his generation with his modern outlook and observational delivery, never raising his voice and almost stammering at times.  When he took to the stage for stand-up, his only prop was a telephone, which he used to pretend to hold a conversation with someone on the other end of the line.  Newhart, who loved an audience, never really retired, and was still a fixture on Hollywood sets and stages through his 80s. Comedy film director Judd Apatow was among those paying tribute on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Bob Newhart was the kindest most hilarious man,"" he posted, adding: ""His brilliant comedy and gentle spirit made everyone he encountered so happy."" Actress Kaley Cuoco, who worked with Newhart on The Big Bang Theory, posted on Instagram: “What a dream it was to witness the genius that was Bob Newhart.  ""He was classy, kind, generous and absolutely hilarious."" Director and actor Paul Feig posted on X: ""A brilliant standup & comedic actor, he was truly one of a kind.” “God, he was funny!

495,Seething anger at Secret Service in town where Trump was shot at,"You don't expect to meet an anti-Trump Republican at a Trump rally. When 67-year-old US Army veteran Thomas Gleason arrived at former President Donald Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, he came looking for conversation.  A registered Republican who is opposed to Trump, Mr Gleason was wearing a placard proclaiming the former president a ""threat to the Constitution"" and challenging the former president's supporters to a friendly debate. ""I had very civil discussions with a lot of people,"" he recalled, ""that was a pleasant surprise"". Soon after, however, the jovial atmosphere of the rally turned to chaos, confusion and rage as shots rang out from a nearby rooftop.  ""I immediately knew what it was. I recognised it as gunfire,"" the former paratrooper told the BBC several days after the shooting. ""Some people screamed, and a lot of people fell to the ground."" The shooting grazed Trump's ear and 50-year-old volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore was left dead. Two others were seriously injured. In the days after the shooting, rallygoers who were in attendance say that their initial feelings of shock have given way to anger, sadness, and fears for what the future may bring.  Many of those who attended the rally have directed their anger at the US Secret Service, which they see as having been responsible for security at the event - and, by extension, their own safety. The Secret Service has said that local police were responsible for the outer cordons of security at the rally and had officers inside the building from where he was shooting. But that does little to soothe the concerns of witnesses such as 66-year-old Kathleen O' Shea, who laid the blame explicitly on the Secret Service's embattled director, Kimberly Cheatle.  Two days after the shooting, Ms O'Shea told the BBC she was ""furious"" that an ""epic failure"" left a man dead and Trump - who she says she would ""take a bullet for"" - with a narrow escape. ""All I want to hear from her [Ms Cheatle] is that she resigns. She got a good, innocent American killed,"" she added. ""She should offer her heartfelt condolences and apologies, and if she means it, she will resign.""   Jean Vincent, a Butler woman who attended the rally alongside her sister Suzanne, said that - no matter who was responsible for what part of security - the Secret Service ""definitely dropped the ball""  on 13 July.  ""I get so emotional. I'm so upset someone could have killed us. Could have killed my children,"" she said, adding that her son shielded her body during the shooting. ""Someone has to be held responsible. They've got to learn."" Ms Vincent said that when she heard the shooting her thoughts immediately went to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, when dozens of people were killed by a gunman firing from the roof of a hotel.  ""There could have been 200, 300 people killed,"" she said. ""It's surreal. Nobody who was there can understand the security breach.""  Former Marine Teresa Wilson - an employee of a local police department elsewhere in Pennsylvania - was at the rally with a group of family members, including her elderly mother and teenage nephew.  She said she remains ""infuriated"" by a security set-up that she said left them ""like sitting ducks"". ""It was a huge and embarrassing failure on their part,"" she said. ""It took two days for me to feel normal again. I was plagued by anxiety over the what-ifs.""  ""Once I heard... early on about explosives being present, I struggled to shake the feeling of insecurity even though I was home and away from danger,"" she added.  ""My heart goes out to the families of the victims. If I had such a difficult time, I can't imagine what they are going through.""  Residents of Butler and its surrounding county describe the largely rural area as friendly and neighbourly, a quiet place. The kind of town in which people know and help each other despite political differences.  Now, some residents fear that their town will forever be known for the events of 13 July.  Among them are partly retired psychiatrist Warren Goodrich and his wife Debbie.  The BBC first encountered them at the site of the rally, where they stood near Trump when he spoke. When the shooting began, they took cover near a young girl who was pleading for her life, a sight that Mrs Goodrich said broke her heart.  ""It's been really hard on us emotionally,"" Mrs Goodrich remarked a few days later. ""It really hurts. It's starting to hit us.... I'm just glad we're alive.""  Over the course of more than 20 years in the town, the Goodrichs say they often tell people elsewhere that they are from Pittsburgh, knowing that few people will know where it is.  Looking to the future, Mr Goodrich said he is worried that Butler will have earned international notoriety and become a ""shunned city"".  ""It's such a significant piece of history. But it's irrational to blame the whole city,"" he said. ""It's very, very sad.""  Echoing a sentiment heard several times by the BBC in Butler, Suzanne Vincent, Jean's sister, said that she believes the town will ""unfortunately be on the map"" at a national level, comparing it to small towns like Uvalde, Texas, which have been marked by tragedies. ""That is so unfair,"" she added. ""But it's changed this community, and it's changed America.""  For now, the motive for the shooting remains unclear, and there has been so far no evidence that proves or even suggests that suspect Matthew Thomas Crooks was motivated by politics. But some of those who witnessed the bloodshed in Butler said they feared that the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate could raise tensions and push people to extremes.  ""It's not just violence against people like Trump and Biden that I'm concerned about,"" said Mr Gleason, the army veteran. ""I'm also worried about violence against people who hold opposing views.""  Jean Vincent said that she believes the US has entered a ""very, very scary"" time in which tensions are running particularly high ahead of the November election.  ""I fear that this country is sliding into chaos and is out of control. I just can't believe everyone is acting so crazy,"" she said. ""There's all this division. What happens in the upcoming election if people are not happy with the outcome?""  Others described the aftermath of the shooting with a feeling of disgust.  ""It's unacceptable, anywhere,"" said Greg Smith, whose business is immediately adjacent to the rally area, hours after it took place.   ""I don't care what candidate you like, or what your philosophy is.  ""No matter the political climate... there is no room for this, anywhere.""

500,"Zelensky: Trump would be hard work, but we are hard workers","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says working with Donald Trump if he is re-elected as US president will be “hard work, but we are hard workers”. In an exclusive interview with the BBC in London, Mr Zelensky said he was willing to work with anyone who in power in the US. Just days ago, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate in November's vote. The 39-year-old has in the past said “he doesn’t care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other”. The nomination has renewed fears that US commitment to Ukraine could fall away if Trump is returned to the White House in November's election. “Maybe he really doesn’t understand what goes on in Ukraine, so we have to work with the United States,” Mr Zelensky told the BBC. The Ukrainian leader is in the UK to attend a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), where he delivered a speech on Thursday afternoon. The EPC, which includes the 27 members of the European Union as well as 20 non-members like the UK, is a more informal forum for co-operation. Mr Zelensky earlier met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has vowed to stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” and has committed to spending £3bn on aid for the country. He said he hoped Mr Starmer's term in Downing Street would mark a ""special"" era in British foreign policy. “I don’t think Britain’s position would change,” Mr Zelensky told the BBC. “But I would like for Prime Minister Starmer to become special - speaking about international politics, about defending world security, about the war in Ukraine."" He added that Ukraine “doesn’t just need a new page, we need power to turn this leaf”. On Friday morning, President Zelensky will address a meeting of the UK cabinet in person - the first foreign leader to do so since US President Bill Clinton in 1997. He is expected to brief ministers about the situation in Ukraine and the need to ramp up Europe’s defence industrial base. The two leaders will also sign a £3.5bn defence export finance deal. Ukraine’s troops have faced a tough spring and earlier this week it was confirmed that they had withdrawn from the village of Krynky on the occupied eastern bank of the Dnipro river. In recent months, the Ukrainian army has had to try and hold back Russian troops along a very long front line in the east of the country. The city of Kharkiv and the surrounding areas have sustained continued attacks as Russian forces attempt to make gains in the region. Ukraine had hoped that its military efforts would be boosted by the arrival of F-16 planes promised by allies this summer.  But Mr Zelensky confirmed that Ukraine had yet to see them. “It’s been 18 months and the planes have not reached us,” he said, saying that he was thankful for what Ukraine had been given. But he emphasised that new fighters were essential to help Ukrainians push back against Russia's aerial dominance and “unblock the skies”. With the war continuing for more than two years without an end in sight, questions have been raised as to whether there could be a negotiated solution. Last month, Switzerland hosted a Ukraine peace summit but Russia was not invited. Mr Zelensky has since said that Russia should attend a second peace summit penned for November. He told the BBC that the whole world will need to put pressure on Russia in order to persuade it to sit down and consider ending the war. “It doesn’t mean that all territories are won back by force. I think the power of diplomacy can help,” he said, adding that a weaker Russia on the battlefield would put Ukraine in a stronger position on the negotiating table. “By putting pressure on Russia, I think it is possible to agree to a diplomatic settlement.” Mr Zelensky has been Ukraine’s leader since 2019 and throughout Russia's full-scale invasion. While elections were due this year, Ukraine’s constitution rules out a ballot during the time of martial law. The president told the BBC that he did envisage a time when he would step down as president. “But not until the war is over,"" he said.",2024-07-18 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe25prezgzo,"Chris Mason,",2024-07-18 22:28:07,
513,What time will Trump speak at the RNC? - what to expect on day four,"Donald Trump will deliver his curtain-closing speech at the climax of the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.  The presidential nominee will be watched by former First Lady Melania Trump, making a rare public appearance. Tens of thousands of people have been attending the four-day jamboree this week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the party makes its case to voters ahead of November’s general election. Trump is expected to deliver ""a deep message of unity"" and share his vision of ""a new golden age for America"" in a speech lasting about an hour, according to campaign and party officials. He is due to take the stage, for what will be his third consecutive Republican nomination, at around 21:00 local time (02:00 GMT) after a performance by Kid Rock. Trump told the Washington Examiner he completely rewrote the speech to make it less combative after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt last Saturday in Pennsylvania. Scheduled to speak earlier on Thursday are World Wrestling Entertainment legend Hulk Hogan, Eric Trump, former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trump lawyer Alina Habba, and the head of Trump Golf International. Dana White, head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson are also expected to take to the podium.  The former first lady is scheduled to walk out to the family box to watch her husband's speech in her first appearance at the 2024 convention since it began on Monday.  Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner are also expected to join the former first lady. Barron Trump is not currently expected to appear. The family members are expected to join Trump on stage after his address for the balloon drop that is all part of the razzmatazz of a US party political conference. Once every four years each of the two main US parties hosts a convention to formally select their respective White House standard-bearer and prepare for the final stretch of campaigning. During the convention, the delegates from each state pledge their support to the candidate of their choice and approve a platform.  It was merely a formality for Trump as the party's presumptive nominee because he won 2,265 delegates in the primaries, enough for the nomination. The Democrats hold their convention next month in Chicago.  Thursday's theme is ""Make America Great Once Again"". Monday's was  ""Make America Wealthy Once Again"", Tuesday was ""Make America Safe Again"", and Wednesday ""Make America Strong Again"". The streamlined party platform this year is 16 pages, and firmly bears the nominee's endorsement, softening the language on abortion and avoiding a definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. It's considerably shorter than the last two RNC platforms in 2016 and 2020, which spanned about 66 pages and included some policies Trump himself had not approved. You can follow the latest news, including live pages, at bbc.com/news.  The BBC News TV channel will broadcast Trump's speech live on Thursday and bring you reaction and analysis afterwards. And you can also watch on the RNC website.",2024-07-18 23:10:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz47lq85lx7o,"Ana Faguy,",2024-07-18 19:10:07,
515,Lara Trump's meteoric rise signals changing of Trump family guard," As Lara Trump strode on to centre stage at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night, it was a moment that symbolised a change of guard in the Trump family that has taken place since his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Wearing a black dress and a shimmering USA flag brooch, she used the primetime spotlight to sell voters on her father-in-law's softer edges, focusing on his role as a grandfather to her two young children. And the party faithful roared as she raised a fist and spoke about a gunman's attempt on his life on Saturday, mirroring Trump's actions on the rally stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a bullet narrowly missed his head. ""Maybe you got to see a side of Donald Trump on Saturday that you were not sure existed, until you saw it with your own eyes,"" she told the crowd. Ms Trump, 41 and now the co-chair of the Republican Party, was hand-picked by her father-in-law for that role as he runs for another White House term and stands atop a party apparatus firmly under his grip. Ms Trump, her husband Eric and his older brother Don Jr have emerged as the family's leading voices in Donald Trump's campaign against US President Joe Biden, and they are some of the most influential figures in his political orbit. By contrast, Ivanka Trump, Trump's eldest daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner - a power couple who enjoyed a high profile in the White House after Trump's 2016 win - have kept their distance from politics over the last four years. Lara was the first family member to officially speak at this convention and her presence has ignited interest in not just her role in the family but also any further political ambitions. “I thought she was fantastic,"" said Alina Habba, Trump's legal spokeswoman who shot to prominence defending him in his civil sexual assault case in New York. ""I think she spoke from the heart. She spoke about moms. She spoke about him being a grandfather - things that only she can speak about.” Long-time observers expect Lara Trump's prominence in the family to only grow. ""Her speech was her introduction to the nation in a big way because while she's had roles in campaigns previously and while she's been a part of Trump's inner circle and family orbit for the last eight years, this is the first time she is positioned in a role that has real power inside the Republican Party,"" said Eric Cortellessa, a reporter who recently interviewed Ms Trump for a Time magazine profile. ""And she's in a position where she's out to prove herself as not just an effective surrogate for Trump, but a political operator. And we're going to see that play out in the next four months as she's co-chairing the RNC."" Michele Merrell, a Republican state committeewoman for Broward county in Florida, said the appointment of Ms Trump in the RNC had made a ""world of difference"". ""The fundraising is going through the roof… we were not doing very well before in that. The change in leadership has been all the difference,"" she said. ""It’s reignited the party, it really has."" Some see parallels between the role of Lara and Eric Trump in this presidential campaign, and that of Jared and Ivanka in 2016. However, Eric has a prominent role in the Trump Organization and would probably act as the eyes and ears for his father's sprawling business empire if Trump was to win the White House. Lara is positioned to continue her ascent in the Republican Party, but there's another Trump who might also have aspirations of building a political dynasty, said Eric Cortellessa. ""Don Jr says he's not interested in politics, but everybody else around him, including his sister-in-law and brother, think that he's got a real itch for politics,"" he said. ""In fact Lara Trump, said to me in a recent interview - 'if there's any Trump who is going to run for higher office, look out for Don'."" Eric and Don Jr are a constant presence around their father, and have rallied around him since the attempt on his life. They were also reportedly some of the loudest voices when it came to picking JD Vance as Trump's running mate. Don Jr, a favourite of the Make America Great Again (Maga) base, appeared tearful on Monday night when Donald Trump walked into the convention hall to a hero's welcome. Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the convention, he spoke charismatically of his father's softer side - and like his sister-in-law sold him as a grandfather and family man. He even introduced his 17-year-old daughter, Kai Trump, onto stage, who described Donald Trump as a ""normal grandpa"".  “When I made the high honor roll,"" she said, ""he printed it out to show his friends how proud he was of me.""  It's a public messaging strategy that attempts to blunt Democratic attacks on Trump as an authoritarian threat to democracy should he return to office. ""We’re having perhaps world-changing types of conversations and he’s interrupting and talking about his grandchildren for 15 minutes,"" Don Jr told the room.  But the emphasis on the unity and love of the family does not hide that some key members are a missing presence so far at the Republican National Convention.  Trump's wife Melania rarely appears in public with her husband and has not been seen publicly by his side since the rally shooting.  Their son Barron, 18, has not yet appeared at the convention either. He has been kept out of the public eye for years but stood to receive a standing ovation at a recent Trump rally in Miami, signalling that he might have a political future too. Linda Stoch, the vice-president of Club 47 USA, which hosted Trump for his 78th birthday in June, dismissed the idea that Melania and Barron would not appear at the convention. ""His family have always been with him, from day one,"" she said. When asked if she saw any particular Trump family member ushering in the next phase of Maga politics, Ms Stoch said we would have to wait and see. She then paused, and added: ""Maybe Barron.""",2024-07-18 23:10:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgl9x70x41o,"Brandon Livesay,",2024-07-18 09:10:08,

516,The young stars to follow at the Paris Olympics,"In the build-up to the opening of the 30th summer Olympics on Friday, 26 July, BBC Sport takes a look at the rising stars and future champions set to shine in the French capital. At the age of 17, Phoebe Gill is set to become the youngest British track athlete to compete at an Olympic Games for more than 40 years. The 800m sensation beat Jemma Reekie, who finished fourth at Tokyo 2020, to win her first British title in June and confirm her Olympic debut. Gill broke the European under-18 800m record by clocking one minute 57.86 seconds two weeks after her 17th birthday in May and will now seek to emulate team-mate Keely Hodgkinson by winning a medal as a teenager at her first Games. Record-breaking 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is ready to make a splash at her second Olympics. The Canadian is the world record holder in the 400m individual medley and second-fastest woman in history in both the 400m and 800m freestyle, and ended three-time defending Olympic champion Katie Ledecky's 13-year unbeaten streak in the 800m freestyle in February. In Paris she will contest the 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley - she is a two-time world champion in both - along with the 200m individual medley, 400m freestyle and probably several relay events. Lola Tambling will join fellow teenager Sky Brown - who became Britain’s youngest Olympic medallist by winning park bronze aged 13 in 2021 - in the skateboarding at Paris 2024. Tambling's journey to the Games began when she was just seven years old - inspired after her parents opened a skatepark in Saltash, Cornwall. Lola: Teenage Olympic 'hero in a halfpipe' The 16-year-old finished sixth at last year's World Championships, proving she is ready to be a contender when she makes her Olympic debut at the Place de La Concorde. Toby Roberts was the first British man to qualify for Olympic climbing, and the 19-year-old will be joined by Hamish McArthur, 23, in making history in Paris. Roberts, who made his first recorded climb at just three years old, clinched his first lead World Cup title at the Chamonix World Cup in July last year - three weeks after winning his first Word Cup title with Bouldering gold in Italy. That made Roberts the first British climber to triumph in two different World Cup disciplines before his first Olympics, where Erin McNeice, 20, and Molly Thompson-Smith, 26, complete GB's climbing squad. Quincy Wilson is the youngest man in history to be selected to represent Team USA in track and field, aged just 16. The American broke an under-18 world record in the 400m that had stood for 42 years when he clocked 44.66 seconds in the heats at the US trials in June, reducing that to 44.59 in the semi-finals two days later. He was named on the USA's 4x400m relay squad for Paris after finishing sixth in the final in 44.94secs - a third successive sub-45 run - to make US history. Twelve years after being inspired to try archery after watching the film 'Brave', 19-year-old Penny Healey will make her Olympic debut. Healey will compete in the women's individual and team events in Paris after helping GB win bronze at the final Olympic qualifying event in Antalya in June. She was shortlisted for BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year following a 2023 season in which she claimed two European golds, and already this year she has won European Grand Prix gold on home soil and her first individual World Cup title. Anna Hursey began playing table tennis at the age of five, first represented her country aged 10, and in Paris will become an Olympian at 18 years old. Born in Wales, Hursey moved to China - where her mother is from - to train full-time in 2019. Three years later, she won women's doubles bronze at the Commonwealth Games. Not only a soon-to-be Olympic athlete, Hursey hopes to help save the planet as a United Nations Young Champion on climate change - a role she accepted when she was 13. Despite being just 17, this will be Quan Hongchan's second Games - and the Chinese diver will start as the defending champion in the women's 10m platform. Then 14, Quan set a world record in Tokyo to beat 15-year-old team-mate Chen Yuxi to gold, earning perfect scores from all seven judges on two of her five dives. China have won all but one of the diving golds at both the past two Olympics and Quan will once again be favourite after collecting five World Championship golds since winning the Olympic title. Emma Finucane heads to Paris as a world and European champion and has been compared to former British cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who won two Olympic golds and six world sprint titles. The Welsh 21-year-old, who started cycling at eight years old, was crowned Britain’s first world women's sprint champion for a decade in Glasgow last year, before becoming Britain's first female European sprint champion in Apeldoorn in January. Finucane follows Becky James and Pendleton as only the third British woman to win world sprint gold, which came after she recorded the fastest-ever 200m by a woman at sea level en route to the final. Artistic gymnast Abigail Martin has only just completed her GCSEs and won't know her results when she competes at her first Olympic Games. The 16-year-old will be GB’s youngest gymnast in Paris but she already boasts a European silver medal as part of the British women's team at this year's championships in Rimini. In her first year as a senior, Martin has won three medals at the British Championships and clinched floor bronze at the 2024 Osijek World Cup to make the grade as a member of Team GB.",2024-07-18 23:10:08,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cye0815j831o,Harry Poole,2024-07-18 23:10:08,
512,Urgent action needed as malaria resists key drug,"Millions of lives are at risk unless urgent and radical action is taken to stop drug-resistant malaria spreading in Africa, scientists warn. Malaria parasites that can shrug off the effects of the critical drug artemisinin are now well-established in East Africa.  Resistance levels have soared in some areas from fewer than 1% to more than 20% of cases in the space of three years.  The last time resistance to an antimalarial spread in Africa it led to a tripling in the number of children dying.  Twenty-eight leading malaria scientists from 10 countries have made the call to action in the journal Science. Artemisinin kills the malaria parasite and is the cornerstone of treatment. Parasites that could resist artemisinin evolved for the first time in Africa in Rwanda, and then separately in Uganda and Eritrea.  These resistant parasites have spread within their countries and across borders. Now, more than 10% of malaria cases are caused by resistant parasites in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania.  “Now is the time to act before millions of people die due to increasingly ineffective antimalarial treatments,” said Prof Olugbenga Mokuolu, from the department of paediatrics at the University of Ilorin in Nigeria. In 2016, resistant strains were hardly being detected in northern Uganda. By 2019, more than 20% of parasites tested were resistant in several regions.  The group of scientists say the further spread of these resistant parasites is ""inexorable"". Dr Mehul Dhorda, from the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Thailand, told me it was still uncertain how quickly that would happen.  However, something similar has already played out in South East Asia, where artemisinin-based treatments started to fail.  ""The time from first detection to when it was overwhelmingly prevalent was 10 to 15 years,"" he said. A similar story has happened before. The parasite became resistant to a previous drug - chloroquine - in East Africa in the 1970s, and resistance reached the west coast by the 1980s.  Malaria deaths on the continent trebled from about 493,000 in 1980 to 1.6 million by 2004. ""I’m hoping this is not something we will see in Africa,"" Dr Dhorda told me. ""If artemisinin combination therapy starts failing, then cases and deaths will go up."" The authors have made a series of recommendations targeting both the parasite and the mosquitoes that spread the disease. They suggest adding a third drug to the artemisinin combination therapy to make it harder for the parasite to evolve resistance to therapy. Dr Dhorda says this will cost money but: ""We might spend a little more now, but if not we'll be spending a lot more to control the fire rather than putting it out before it became widespread."" They also call for:  “We ask funders, specifically the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the US government’s President’s Malaria Initiative, to be visionary and to step up funding for malaria control and elimination programmes to contain the spread of artemisinin resistance in Africa,” said Ntuli Kapologwe, director of preventive services at the Ministry of Health in Tanzania.",2024-07-18 23:10:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe25v5d8l9o,"James Gallagher,",2024-07-18 18:10:08,
509,US reporter's secretive 'sham' trial in Russia nears end,"I’m at the Sverdlovsk Regional Courthouse in Yekaterinburg, just metres away from Courtroom 5A where US journalist Evan Gershkovich is on trial. The Wall Street Journal reporter, who’s 32, is facing espionage charges, rejected by him, his employers and the White House. He’s the first Western journalist on trial for spying since the Cold War. But I’ll be honest with you: I have little sense of what’s happening inside that room. Evan’s trial is being held behind closed doors. That means no media, no friends and family, no diplomats, no members of the public allowed in. The journalists here are having to rely on snippets through the day from the court press secretary: “The court’s taking a 15-minute break.” “The hearing has resumed.” “The hearing is over for the day.” When the hearing ends, the press secretary announces that proceedings will resume tomorrow, Friday, with closing arguments. It feels like the end of this trial is near. Evan Gershkovich’s employer has denounced this as a “sham trial”. “This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job,” The Wall Street Journal’s editor-in-chief Emma Tucker wrote last month. Russian security services claim that Mr Gershkovich was gathering classified information about a Russian defence plant near Yekaterinburg and spying for the CIA.  Evan, his newspaper and the US government fiercely reject the accusation. The WSJ has accused Russia of “stockpiling Americans” to trade them for Russians jailed abroad.  Referring to American citizens arrested in Russia, this week the US ambassador to the United Nations accused President Vladimir Putin of “treating human beings as bargaining chips”. Evan Gershkovich’s trial began last month. Thursday's hearing, the second, had been scheduled for 13 August.  Suddenly everything’s speeded up. In an unexpected move, the court brought the hearing forward to Thursday. We’ve been allowed inside the courthouse and are close to the courtroom. Not too close, though, The corridor leading to 5A has been cordoned off and a masked police officer is on guard to make sure we don’t get any nearer. A court official has instructed us to stay right here. At one point we, the BBC, become the centre of attention. “May I take a photo of you for my news outlet?” a local journalist asks me. “If it’s OK with you I’d rather you didn’t,” I reply, “but thank you for checking first”. “No problem,” he replies, before proceeding to take lots of photos of me and posting online. Within minutes local and national news sites are reporting that the BBC is here at the courthouse. We sit waiting for news from 5A. Every so often, Mr Gershkovich's defence lawyer exits the courtroom and walks past. But she won’t take questions. More waiting. Suddenly a local lawmaker strides down the corridor and heads for the exit. This is the man who had told Russian state media that he had met Evan Gershkovich during the journalist’s reporting trip to Yekaterinburg. So, after just two court hearings, it feels as if we’re nearing the end. And then what? If, as expected, the judge declares Mr Gershkovich guilty, the maximum possible sentence is 20 years in a penal colony. But Moscow has indicated it may be open to doing a deal with the Americans to release him. The Russians barely hide the fact that they view a jailed American as currency, as a bargaining chip, as an opportunity to extract one of their own from a foreign jail. Moscow knows that America is prepared to undertake prisoner swaps in order to release its own citizens. We know Russia and America have been discussing the possibility. We also know that Donald Trump has boasted that he’s the man to secure Mr Gershkovich's release. So, have Moscow and Washington done some kind of deal to bring Evan home?

510,Impeached judge itching to take on South African president,"In a sign of the seismic political changes in South Africa, John Hlophe, a once-celebrated judge whose career ended ignominiously with his impeachment just five months ago, has been parachuted into parliament to lead the official opposition.  Dr Hlophe is expected to be in full flight on Friday, when he will open the debate in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa's speech on Thursday, setting out his new coalition government's plans to tackle South Africa's myriad problems - including an unemployment rate of 32%, high levels of crime, deteriorating infrastructure, and land ownership in a nation bedevilled by racial inequality. ""Watch this space. See him perform on Friday,"" Dr Hlophe's lawyer Barnabas Xulu told the BBC.  Dr Hlophe's dramatic fall as a judge - and meteoric rise as a politician - can both be traced to former President Jacob Zuma, South Africa's most polarising politician who defied the odds by making his own stunning comeback in the 29 May general election.  Less than three years after he became the first South African president to be jailed for an offence - contempt of court - Mr Zuma led his newly formed party, uMkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) into third spot in the election.  But as he was barred from taking up his seat in parliament because of the 15-month jail sentence he had received, Mr Zuma turned to Dr Hlophe to take up the all-important post of Leader of the Opposition.  The post comes with an annual salary of just under 1.7m rand ($94,000; £73,000), which Dr Hlophe is likely to appreciate after reportedly losing his judge's pension because of his impeachment for gross misconduct.  MK has become the official opposition because the second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has joined President Ramaphosa's coalition government after his African National Congress (ANC) lost its majority in the election for the first time since the end of the racist system of apartheid in 1994. Born in 1959, Dr Hlophe, who grew up as a child labourer in a family where his mother was a domestic worker and gardener and his father a security guard and traditional healer, went on to study law locally and abroad, acquiring a PhD from the UK's prestigious University of Cambridge.  As a lawyer in South Africa, he took part in court battles challenging the draconian laws of the apartheid regime, before forging a career as an academic, returning to Cambridge as a Roman law tutor in 1987.   Despite this, Dr Hlophe is a fierce advocate for the ""Africanisation"" of South Africa's legal system, saying it was ""imposed on us"" by colonisers, and which ""we have mastered, by the way, even better than them"" - a comment he made in an address to the African Legal Professionals Association in the coastal city of Durban soon after he joined MK in June. ""African law has never been allowed to develop and take its rightful place,"" he added. Dr Hlophe returned to the theme after being sworn in as an MP, saying MK was not ""apologetic in our call for the law to be Africanised"". ""By that, we mean we bring back the laws that used to govern the African people. One of those laws is this: the land in Africa can never be the subject of private ownership. The land belongs to the nation,"" he said.    Some critics saw Mr Zuma's decision to appoint him as MK's parliamentary leader as returning a political favour.  His impeachment in February ended a long-running saga that started in 2008 when two judges of South Africa's highest court sent shockwaves through legal and political circles by accusing him of trying to improperly influence them to rule in favour of Mr Zuma in a corruption-related case that the controversial politician was fighting at the time.    Dr Hlophe denied the charges, with Mr Xulu telling the BBC that he simply had a ""casual conversation"" with the two judges about ""legal principles"" in what was a ""novel"" case - something that judges often do among themselves.  Mr Xulu said that Dr Hlophe was still challenging the lawfulness of his impeachment in the courts, though he did not see himself going back to being a judge.  Instead, Dr Hlophe had decided to branch out into politics, joining MK as it was his ""ideal"" political home, he said.  ""He'll continue the fight for justice and transformation in a different platform, the National Assembly, where he will have more freedom, more protection,"" Mr Xulu added. Dr Hlophe's impeachment marked a sad end to his judicial career, as he was once among the cream of South Africa's judges, or, as constitutional law expert Narnia Bohler-Muller put it in The Conversation magazine, he was ""both brilliant and controversial, on and off the bench"".  At the age of 35, in 1995, just a year after the end of apartheid, he made history by becoming the first back judge in South Africa's Western Cape province, and five years later its Judge President.  But his leadership there was turbulent, as he accused some of his colleagues of treating him as a ""legal non-entity"" and undermining him because he was black. He faced counter-claims of being verbally abusive and even assaulting a judge, which he dismissed as a malicious allegation based on rumour and gossip.  He was also embroiled in numerous other controversies - including allegations that he served as a non-executive director at a financial company, and was paid about $26,000 over three years in consultancy fees.  He denied any wrongdoing, saying he had declared his links with the company to the-then justice minister. The Judicial Services Commission (JSC) dismissed a case against him over the issue, saying there was a lack of evidence. Now, he has become the first ex-judge to become not only the Leader of the Opposition, but also a member of parliament's justice committee, and, to top it all, MK's representative on the JSC.  Comprising both judges and cross-party MPs, the JSC is the very body that found Dr Hlophe guilty of gross misconduct, leading to parliament impeaching him.  It is also responsible for the appointment of judges, and will choose his successor as Western Cape Judge President.  His long-time adversaries have vowed to challenge his elevation to the JSC in court, with campaign group Freedom Under Law saying it was ""irrational"" for an impeached judge to be involved in the appointment of other judges.  Significantly, the ANC supported his appointment to the JSC, while two of its coalition partners, the DA and the Afrikaner nationalist Freedom Front Plus, opposed it. William Gumede, an academic at Wits University's School of Governance in Johannesburg, said the ANC's decision did not come as a surprise.  ""There are going to be big battles with MK, but this is not one that the ANC was prepared to fight because it could have set the wrong tone for the opening of parliament,"" Prof Gumede told the BBC. Furthermore, the ANC had to take into account the fact that Dr Hlophe remains popular, despite his impeachment, said Prof Gumede.  ""Many black voters appear not to mind supporting people implicated in abusing public office, if these people can successfully cast themselves as victims of a conspiracy, supposedly by the 'system',"" he added. He said a lot now depended on how Dr Hlophe performed in parliament. ""If he provides effective opposition, MK could grow and he could potentially be its next leader,"" Prof Gumede added.  This is a far cry from the 65-year-old's childhood as a labourer for a sugar-cane farmer whom he called ""filthy rich"" - a man who went on to help finance his university education. ""I grew up poor, like most South Africans,"" he told a podcast hosted by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), an opposition party with whom MK has formed an alliance in parliament. ""I started weeding sugar-cane fields at the age of 12. I would carry 12kg of fertiliser on my back and I would never look back. We used to work very hard, even Christmas and public holidays. There were just no holidays, considering there were no labour laws then,"" Dr Hlophe added.  His comments are a poignant reminder of black people's lives under white-minority rule - and the racial and ideological fault-lines that run through a country where black people have only been allowed to vote for 30 years.

508,Trump VP pick Vance vows to fight for 'forgotten' Americans,"Donald Trump’s vice-presidential pick JD Vance vowed in a primetime speech to fight for working-class Americans that he argued had been “cast aside and forgotten” by the Democrats. Introducing himself to millions of Americans watching on TV at home, the Ohio senator channelled his humble roots in the Midwest as he assailed “career politicians” like President Joe Biden. He argued in his address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that Trump was the ""last best hope” for Americans. Trump and his running mate will challenge the Democratic White House ticket, currently Mr Biden and his Vice-President, Kamala Harris, in November’s election. Mr Biden’s account on X, formerly Twitter, hit back at Mr Vance on Wednesday night, over his positions on abortion and Ukraine. Mr Vance, 39, is hoping to become one of the youngest vice-presidents in US history. In the speech, he charted his journey from a difficult childhood in small-town Ohio to the US Marines, Yale Law School, and finally the US Senate. The author of best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his impoverished family in Appalachian coal country, said “America’s ruling class” had destroyed communities like his hometown with trade agreements and foreign wars. “From Iraq to Afghanistan, from the financial crisis to the Great Recession, from open borders to stagnating wages, the people who govern this country have failed and failed again,” he said. He continued: “Donald Trump represents America’s last best hope to restore what – if lost – may never be found again. “A country where a working-class boy, born far from the halls of power, can stand on this stage.” The running mate, who is married to Usha Vance, a lawyer and daughter of Indian immigrants, said the US had traditionally welcomed newcomers, but that it ought not to import foreign labour. “When we allow newcomers, we allow them on our terms,” he said. Mr Vance was previously an opponent of Trump, once dismissing the Republican as an “idiot” who could become “America’s Hitler”. By then a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, he later mended fences with Trump. He won the former president's endorsement and was elected to the Senate in 2022, taking office the following year. Democrats have seized on some of Mr Vance’s past statements, including that he doesn’t “really care what happens to Ukraine” and support for a nationwide abortion ban. He has recently moderated his stance on abortion to align with the official Republican platform, which says the issue should be decided by individual states. He did not mention the war in Ukraine during his speech, or say much at all about foreign policy, which was the theme of the third day of the party conference. Mr Vance did say that US allies must share in the burden of securing world peace and America would avoid conflict but “punch hard” if provoked under a second Trump presidency. He began his speech by talking about last Saturday's assassination attempt on Trump. ""They accused him of being a tyrant,"" he said. ""They said he must be stopped at all costs. But how did he respond? He called for national unity, for national calm.” In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mr Vance blamed it on Mr Biden’s rhetoric and his warnings that his Republican rival poses a threat to democracy. Most Americans had little knowledge of him until Wednesday night. A CNN poll conducted last month showed that 13% of registered voters said they had a favourable opinion of Mr Vance and 20% an unfavourable one – nearly two-thirds either had never heard of him or had no opinion. Some convention-goers on Wednesday said they were still learning about his biography. Cindy Dore and Jackie Canon, two Republican delegates from Louisiana, said they were excited by Trump’s pick. “He’s young, vibrant,” Ms Dore said. She said she appreciated Hillbilly Elegy, but other than that, she didn’t know a lot about Mr Vance. The speeches began shortly after it was announced that President Biden had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and temporarily suspended campaign activities. The climax of the Republican convention will be Donald Trump’s speech on Thursday night. Chris Devine - an associate professor of politics at the University of Dayton and co-author of Do Running Mates Matter? - told the BBC that vice-presidential picks tend to have quite a small effect on the overall race. “If it’s the case that people look at JD Vance and see him as insufficiently experienced, they will think less of Donald Trump and his judgement,” he says. ""Not by a lot, but potentially on the margins."" But Mr Devine also noted that Mr Vance is an “incredibly talented communicator” despite being a relative political newcomer.

507,"Fangirls aren't silly, they're powerful, says playwright","From causing seismic activity at Harry Styles concerts to Swifties boosting the UK economy during the Eras Tour, the power of teenage female pop fans shouldn't be underestimated. For playwright Yve Blake, the danger of dismissing these youngsters is the inspiration behind her new comedy musical Fangirls. Following the life of 14-year-old Edna, who is obsessed with a boy band resembling One Direction, Fangirls explores ""what it means to love something without apology"".  The idea came to Blake in 2015 after she witnessed a pivotal moment in the lives of thousands of teenage girls - Zayn Malik left One Direction. Despondent and heartbroken fans across the world were shown weeping inconsolably - but for Blake, something even more interesting caught her eye.  ""People started calling these young girls crazy, hysterical and psycho,"" the writer explains. ""I asked myself the question - would the same words be used to describe male football fans? ""The girls screaming at the top of their lungs at Taylor Swift concerts are cringe, but men running around with their tops off and fist pumping the air because England scored a goal are just supporting their country. ""It seems like there's definitely a double standard there."" But the musical doesn't just praise fangirls.  ""It's a lot more nuanced than that,"" Blake explains. ""We look at the dark side of worshipping celebrities as well as praising the decision for girls to make an empowered choice to love something free of judgement. ""I'd describe it as a glittery trojan horse."" The hit musical premiered in 2019 in Blake's home country, Australia, and has been met with critical acclaim across three runs.  Its stint at the Sydney Opera House was awarded five stars by Time Out, which said ""it deals with the exquisite pain of being a teenager, of having little agency and lesser respect from the world around you"".  In a four-star review, the Guardian called it ""witty and agile"" and said it ""balances serious social reflections with a loving twinkle in its eye"".  Blake says the show ""retains its fearlessness, cheekiness and naughtiness from Australia, but the screws have really been tightened"". She is both excited and nervous about bringing the show to the Lyric theatre in Hammersmith, west London. ""Brits are definitely a lot more repressed than Aussies, so I don't know if they can match the energy of previous runs,"" Blake says.  At one point in the show, the stage is transformed into a concert venue and audience participation is encouraged. ""Theatre is so polite normally, but Fangirls is about unleashing your feral excitement and screaming like you're 14 again."" In Australia, Blake had no problem getting the audience involved - she tells the BBC that an older lady in the front row accidentally flashed the actors because she ""was so in the moment and excitedly dancing"".  Playing the lead role of Edna is Jasmine Elcock, who got a golden buzzer on Britain’s Got Talent in 2016. The singer was 14 when she reached the talent show final, and this is her first major acting role.  ""I'm excited for people to be able to see the world through the eyes of a young girl,"" Elcock says. As a self-proclaimed fangirl, Elcock can relate to the feelings and emotions that the play delves into.  ""I am a mega fangirl and at the moment I am absolutely obsessed with Little Simz. I can spend hours in my bedroom dancing and singing along to her,"" she says. In comparison, writer Blake explains she was a ""victim of my own cringe growing up"". ""I was socially embarrassed to be a fangirl so I definitely repressed it as a teenager,"" she says. ""As an adult that's what made me interested in exploring this topic - I woke up to the fact that my cringe was a symptom of internalised misogyny because it's only the things that teenage girls like that are ever called cringeworthy."" It seems that for Blake, this play is a way for her to tell her younger self, and all teenage girls out that, that it's OK to let lose and embrace being a fangirl.

511,Dying for sport: Abuse claims rock Australian greyhound racing,"In 2015 Australia’s multi-billion-dollar greyhound racing industry vowed it would clean up its act. A damning investigation at the time had exposed the preventable deaths of as many as 17,000 young dogs a year - revelations so shocking the government of the day rushed to implement an ultimately short-lived ban. Almost a decade later, Greyhound Racing New South Wales (GRNSW)  - the epicentre of the sport in the country - is back in the spotlight for alleged abuse, due to the work of one whistleblower. In an explosive report made public by lawmakers, the organisation's former chief veterinarian has described the industry as a hotbed of “exploitation and suffering”, claiming that dogs are being raced at “barbaric” rates, euthanised without cause, or left to rot in metal cages when they can no longer compete. Executive heads are rolling, and an inquiry, which GRNSW says it “welcomes”, has been announced to investigate the accusations, as calls from critics to have greyhound racing outlawed grow louder. But despite evidence of slipping public support, the state’s premier has said he won’t shut down the sport, prompting a standoff with those calling for that to happen. “The reality is the greyhound racing industry cannot exist without systemic animal cruelty,” says NSW Animal Justice MP Emma Hurst. “It will be shut down – it’s just a matter of when.” Australia has been touted as the world’s largest commercial greyhound racing industry - with roughly 60 tracks in operation. New Zealand, the US, the UK and Ireland are also home to markets, but none operate at the same velocity. Thanks to online betting, Australia’s industry has seen rising profits in recent years, turning over A$8.3bn ($5.6bn; £4.3bn)  in 2023 - with 75% of the money coming from Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), according to the greyhound protection organisation GREY2K.  The spark that ignited the current outcry over the sport’s practices was a “handover” letter, from GRNSW’s Chief Veterinary Officer Alex Brittan to his incoming replacement - his final act in a job that by his own account, had nearly broken him. The 54-page document contains a litany of accusations - including claims that GRNSW had worked with vets “unaccepting of modern medicine” who were prone to euthanising dogs without cause, and that the company’s leadership was directing staff to treat animal welfare groups “as the enemy”. Within hours of Mr Brittan’s letter becoming public, the chief of GRNSW Rob Macaulay had resigned and the rest of the company’s board is now fighting for their survival. NSW’s Gaming and Racing Minister David Harris has announced an inquiry into Mr Brittan’s claims which will be led by the industry’s regulator - something which GRNSW has been quick to embrace. “We welcome the opportunity for an external examination of our processes and record,” its acting CEO Wayne Billett wrote in a statement. And a spokesperson for GRNSW told the BBC that the organisation takes concerns related to animal welfare “very seriously”. But Mr Brittan’s account differs. In his letter he described witnessing “cases of extreme distress” in which competing dogs had “recent pools of blood” around them after ripping off their toenails while “clawing” at their caged doors. He also called out a flurry of “preventable” on-track deaths, due to greyhounds running into poles with “no padding on them” and questioned the figures GRNSW had put forward concerning how many retired dogs it had found homes for - a practice which gives the sport its social licence to operate. Mr Brittan says that of the roughly 4,200 dogs entering the industry each year, only 1,600 were making it out and finding owners, with the rest living out their days in “industrial kennels”. Further - he alleged that a company programme which had been set up to export retired greyhounds to the US, so that they could find homes there, had an alarming lack of oversight. To prove his point, he told the story of Carey - a dog who died at Sydney airport after confusing its travelling box with a racer’s starter box and running into a fence at full speed when the door opened. NSW’s premier Chris Minns said he would examine all the allegations put forward by Mr Brittan, but quickly ruled out a blanket ban on greyhound racing in the state. “We're not going to shut down the industry, but we do take this report seriously,” he told reporters last week. And Mr Harris reiterated that the government would make sure the industry was held to “the highest standards of animal welfare and integrity” once the new investigation had concluded. But given GRNSW has weathered multiple crises - including a government-backed inquiry in 2016 which delivered findings of “systemic animal cruelty” and mass killings - advocates are sceptical another inquiry will yield results. “The greyhound racing industry was already given a chance to clean up its act eight years ago, and it’s monumentally failed,” Ms Hurst told the BBC. Mr Brittan has also challenged the impartiality of the current investigation - saying it should be done by an external source, rather than the industry’s own regulator. And he questioned why an all-out ban had been taken off the table already. “It could be perceived as concerning that the premier and gaming minister have stated that the outcome of the inquiry is a foregone conclusion and that, irrespective of any findings, all bets are on, and the gambling will continue,” he said, according to the Guardian. Around the world, the prominence and popularity of dog-racing for sport has been in decline. In the US for example - which used to be one of the sport's largest industries - betting on greyhounds has been outlawed in all but a handful of states, and only two active tracks remain, both in West Virginia. Advocates like Ms Hurst argue that the practice endures in Australia not because of community fanfare, but gambling profits. The last time the industry was in the spotlight in 2016, over 80% of people polled by the country's national broadcaster said they wanted to see it shut down. And in recent years, it has been outlawed in the Australian Capital Territory, while petitions calling for other jurisdictions to follow suit have made their way to several state parliaments. GRNSW says it has no plans to go anywhere - and that racing, which first came to the nation’s shores in the late 1800s, can be done “sustainably”. But Ms Hurst, and others calling for an end to the sport, say that the latest spate of allegations present a unique “opportunity” to “listen to the community and ban this cruel industry”.",2024-07-18 23:10:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8vdrzr9mq1o,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-17 23:10:08,
517,Bus on fire and police car overturned in disorder,"A police car has been flipped over and a bus set alight after disorder broke out in Harehills in Leeds. West Yorkshire Police said officers were initially called to reports of a disturbance at an address in Luxor Street at about 17:00 BST, but that further ""pockets of disorder"" had broken out. Social media footage shows large crowds of people on the streets, a bus on fire and a police car coming under attack before being flipped over. Home Secretary and West Yorkshire MP Yvette Cooper said she was ""appalled at the shocking scenes"". Another video shows a bus completely burnt out near the Compton Centre. In a statement put out earlier, police said no injuries had been reported. A number of roads have been closed and people have been advised to avoid the area. Police said that on arrival officers found ""an ongoing disturbance which involved some agency workers and some children"". A spokesperson said: ""More people started to attend the location and a decision was made to remove the agency workers and the children to a safe place. ""A crowd started to gather and more officers were requested to attend the area, where some pockets of disorder were occurring. ""More officers have been deployed to the area to assist with the management of this incident."" Ms Cooper said: ""I am appalled at the shocking scenes and attacks on police vehicles and public transport in Leeds tonight. Disorder of this nature has no place in our society."" Footage shared on social media showed the police car coming under attack with its windows being smashed in. One person uses a scooter to hit it, while stones and other debris are also thrown. BBC reporter Bethany Parsons, who was near the scene on Harehills Road, described hundreds of people being gathered on the streets. ""There was debris and rubbish strewn all over the floor as well as a big police presence, including armed officers and police vehicles."" Posting on X,  Gipton and Harehills Councillor Salma Arif appeared alongside a police inspector, with a message urging people to stay at home.  Ms Arif said: ""There's an ongoing situation currently in Harehills.  ""We are asking everybody in the area please stay at home at this moment in time."" Insp Nicholls, from the East Leeds Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: ""If you could just stay where you are, stay in your houses while we manage this incident. ""If you are in the crowd I would ask you to go home please so we can keep everybody safe."" Richard Burgon, MP for Leeds East, said on X: ""I am on my way back to Leeds from Parliament and am in touch with the police and concerned residents about the on-going incident in Harehills.

518,Are genuine movie stars being born again?,"For a while, there's been talk of 'the death of stardom', with young actors not able to match the clout of Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Will Smith et al. But that might be changing. There has been no lack of conjecture about what, precisely, makes a Movie Star. Most people would easily name examples for you, but might struggle to define why or how those examples were special. Film scholar Richard Dyer calls the star both ""ordinary and extraordinary"" in his seminal 1979 text, Stars, while academic and writer Jeanine Basinger, in her 2007 book The Star Machine, writes of Hollywood's production line: ""Sometimes a manufactured product turned out perfectly. Sometimes it blew up in the shopping cart"". And as Lauren Bacall once put it: ""Stardom isn't a profession. It's an accident."" For the powers that be, it certainly seems that whenever you try to bottle it or reproduce stardom, it vanishes. Many square-jawed hunks who look the part – say, Sam Worthington in Avatar, for instance – have been tried out by major Hollywood studios and fallen totally flat with audiences. Meanwhile others – like skinny teenager Timothée Chalamet in gay romance Call Me By Your Name – have climbed a strange and stellar path to the A-list. He is starring in mega-sci-fi franchise Dune, whereas in another decade he'd be doomed to playing foppish kid brothers in perpetuity. The fact that stardom has a kind of sketchy refusal to follow any exact science is maybe what makes it so endlessly fascinating to discuss. In a changing Hollywood post-Covid, with cinemas under threat and once-all-powerful streamers in disarray, it has been said frequently that there are no new movie stars. Perhaps movies had become too CGI-driven, too high-concept, too much about explosions and superheroes to really care about the human element, or faces in close-up that had been central to drawing crowds in the past. As Charles Bramesco, a film critic for The Guardian with a special interest in film stardom, says: ""The dearth of movie stars is downstream from a grander and more elaborate problem, which is the studio system's turn away from the mid-budget vehicles that turned likeable talents into household names"". In recent years, there have been many less adult dramas, as well as comedies, especially of the romantic variety, which as Bramesco points out, ""were once the bread and butter of Big Hollywood – but the (false) industry wisdom that they can't be banked on as reliably as special-effects bonanzas has resulted in big-time brain drain"". That might account for why one of our biggest current contenders for the role of Movie Star – Glen Powell – first got mainstream audience members' attention with the box-office success of a romantic comedy. Last year's rom-com Anyone But You, opposite fellow burgeoning star Sydney Sweeney, is the kind of late 90s/early 00’s throwback wherein two very attractive people hate each other but through a series of zany plot machinations are forced to admit they actually love each other. Powell, handsome in the old-school sense, with wavy blond hair and a sharp jawline, is a Texan to top it all off (even his name makes him sound like he should be in 1940s pictures with the likes of Tyrone Power). Powell first played supporting roles in films like Top Gun: Maverick as the jock you loved to hate but also kind of loved. (Tim Rothman, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures, recently told Variety that ""Glen is the classic example of talent meeting opportunity."") Anyone But You went on to gross $220 million in cinemas internationally, starting off slow but becoming a sleeper hit, through word-of-mouth and a long theatrical window. Similarly, in Richard Linklater's comic crime caper Hit Man, now on Netflix, Powell has bursting romantic chemistry with love interest Adria Arjona; along with the film's perfect calibration of Powell's sexiness and goofiness, it's no surprise he's been embraced by audiences. Combined with red carpet footage of him toting his pet dog Brisket – and more importantly, perhaps, Tom Cruise's tacit approval of Powell as a successor when he appeared to support his former co-star at the European premiere of Powell's latest film Twisters – this man seems to be the genuine article. His co-starring role (as a swaggering Texan, no less) in Twisters, a spectacle-driven but old-school disaster blockbuster which is aiming for big box office this July, shows that the actor can helm big, action-packed mainstream releases.     And so, slowly, unexpectedly, along has come a new crop of screen talent that is finally leaving an impression again. Margot Robbie, who had first registered as little more than an impressively sexy blip on the Hollywood radar after her turn in Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, has seized control of her career, become a creative producer, and taken on a series of roles cementing her as a Movie Star. Now, she's Barbie. And then there's been the rise of throwback cornfed all-American boys like Austin Butler, who shot to fame for his heavily Method performance in Baz Luhrmann’s biopic Elvis. The Hollywood Reporter, who recently published a ""new A-list"" piece with Butler at the top, shares that the industry talk is about Butler as a leading man for all seasons. Another big cultural presence is Zendaya, whose earnings for co-producing and starring in sexy sports flick Challengers totalled $10 million alone, with its success proving that she could transcend it-girl status for a proper screen role in an original, non-franchise studio film. If THR are to be believed, there really is a brand new wave of bona-fide Movie Stars primed for our screens.  None of these figures were overnight sensations, and in fact, few real movie stars are. There's often one major film that is identified in retrospect as their star-making turn, but there are years of forgotten television roles and smaller parts that build up the constellation before a Movie Star emerges. Butler was a child star on Nickelodeon for much of his adolescence; Robbie, like many of her Australian cohort, first appeared on popular daytime soap Neighbours; Powell appeared in small parts in films like Hidden Figures, and many others emerged from television to serious acting careers, with HBO's teen drama Euphoria boasting a pretty remarkable trio of alumni: Zendaya, Jacob Elordi and Sydney Sweeney.   As has always been the case, extratextual information about the lives, loves, and tribulations of stardom allows the audience to feel closer to these immortal screen gods – whether supplied by the studio-controlled fan magazines of old or the far more freewheeling celebrity press of today. Tribes of Zendaya or Glen Powell fans on social media, who share interview tidbits or red-carpet moments obsessively, offer a (usually rather successful) addition to the overall likeability and persona of their favourite actor. As Charles Bramesco points out: ""The parasocial dimension of fandom has never been stronger, and media (social and otherwise) lies at the heart of the belief that famous people are our friends. With many of these young stars, we can see media-circuit savvy with the gamut of stage-managed video appearances on Hot Ones and the like."" Hot Ones, the madly popular Youtube interview show featuring A-listers eating increasingly spicy hot wings while answering questions, is a great example of how we sometimes like to see our movie stars faced with some real-life discomfort in spite of their godlike status. If Robbie, who seems to have a combination of ironclad business sense, down-to-earth charm, and preternatural sweetness – all while looking like Barbie herself – surprises viewers who, in accordance with sexist stereotypes, might expect her to seem aloof or vapid, all the better for it. It adds layers to her star persona, and it's what keeps people returning to her and her films. Meanwhile, Timothée Chalamet cultivates a deeply caring image when it comes to his fans, devoting much of his time to taking photos with and greeting them at events; the likeability factor is an important one.  ""There's no substitute for charisma, and while many in the new generation of up-and-comers play on our nostalgia for a glamorous past, Powell's social-media savvy and puppydog relatability have placed him ahead of the pack,"" Bramesco notes. By contrast, though, a figure like Austin Butler has managed to cultivate a mystique, rarely posting to social media, and offering a slightly taciturn smoulder in all his interviews. Whether it's old-school Hollywood mystery or Glen Powell thirst-trapping on Instagram, both stars have made their personalities work for them.  A Movie Star, historically, conformed to a certain ""type"" – studios often had factory-line production strategies that required easy access to, say, a mysterious and dark-eyed stranger, or a matronly aunt with a comic streak, or an innocent blonde waif. Whether emerging from the stage, like the fearsomely beautiful screen-natural Vivien Leigh, or a village beauty contest, or a tenement slum like Barbara Stanwyck, there's a Cinderella-story element to the traditional movie star tale.  But stars are rarely just innocently ""discovered"", as the old story about 40s bombshell Lana Turner being stumbled upon while she drank a milkshake in Schwab’s Pharmacy used to go. You've only got to see one of the many iterations of A Star is Born (the 1954 version with Judy Garland may be your best bet) to see that the process takes labour, both from the person themselves and the team of star-makers around them: a star is groomed to perfection, taught how to walk, talk, dance, sing and comport themselves. And while contemporary star-making may not be like studio-era talent schools, which would sometimes train up-and-comers over a number of years, there is certainly still a sense that time and media savvy are essential to building up a star in the eyes of the public.  From Marilyn Monroe copycats of the era, like Diana Dors and Jayne Mansfield, to the modern urge to find Tom Cruise's heir, the traditional idea of stardom is essentially a formulaic one. Studio execs, talent scouts and casting agents have sought to repeat and mimic the unique and powerful presence of stardom – to varying degrees of success. It’s not just a matter of simple charisma. But equally, careful devising of one's career is not always a guarantee of success.  The best stars have a radiance and magnetism, but also a certain self-awareness. It's important to have the ability to both choose roles which will seem to audiences as a logical ""fit"" for their type, and which go enough ""against type"" – aka allow them to explore their flexibility as performers. Take Austin Butler, using his Marlboro Man voice and retro cred from Elvis to delve back into mid-century Americana à la Marlon Brando and James Dean with The Bikeriders. Sydney Sweeney, an all-American girl who is both reliant on her sex appeal and determined not to be pigeonholed by it, is in dialogue with her own image at all times. The fact that her two upcoming projects are so different is by design: there's Jane Fonda's part in an upcoming Barbarella remake; but equally, Sweeney is co-producing a project about the decidedly less glamorous Christy Martin, the first professional woman boxer.  More like this:  • Why Longlegs is this summer's 'anti-blockbuster'  • Can Deadpool and Wolverine save Marvel? • What Gen Z's sex symbol labels really mean But the discourse grows topsy-turvy when no one can agree on the parameters of what makes a movie star. And maybe that's the whole point: it's ineffable. You might judge it by acting talent and dexterity, but many of the legendary stars played within variations of a type. Humphrey Bogart is sipping a short drink and drawling laconically regardless of where you see him; modern would-be movie stars, like Austin Butler, have also carved out niches playing parts of a certain stripe. Or you could look at bankability and box office success, which would mean Timothée Chalamet would easily make the cut given the financial takings of Dune 2 and Wonka – but others might point out these are both big franchises based on popular IP in their own right, and scoff at the fact such a nontraditional-type leading man was really a Movie Star. Or you might judge it by something far less nameable, which is: Glen Powell's dimpled smile as he gazes unerringly at his leading lady of choice, causing a frisson of recognition and desire in the audience which can only ever come from a Movie Star.  Powell, in spite of not having led any existing franchise, has done well enough at the box office so far that his earnings are reportedly set to skyrocket, along with Chalamet's; according to Variety, Chalamet earned more than $8 million (£6 million) for Wonka, and his salary is now set to move into double-digits for future studio projects. Whether films can open solely on their names, a la Julia Roberts or Cruise or Will Smith, may no longer be the exact metric for Movie Stardom, but it certainly helps. And then there's the relatively box-office unproven Paul Mescal, who is appearing in Ridley Scott's upcoming Gladiator 2, suggesting that many of our burgeoning Movie Stars are progressing toward bankable, mainstream success. So whether it's pure charisma, mainstream appeal, or the canny combination of both, it does seem we’re lucky enough to have entered an exciting period for new faces on screen. And the fact remains: it may be nearly impossible to ascertain what special X factor makes a movie star, but you sure know one when you see one.  Twisters is out in US and UK cinemas on 17 July  -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

They have called it a ""real sign of hope"", after more than 20 years of efforts to revive the reptile's numbers in the remote Cardamom Mountains.  The olive green freshwater reptile has a distinct bony crest at the back of its head - by some estimates, it can grow up to 3m or nearly 10ft.  Locals discovered five nests in May and the baby crocs were born at the end of June,  conservationists said on Thursday.  Siamese crocodiles were once widespread throughout much of South East Asia.  But decades of hunting and habitat loss have tuned them into what conservations classify as ""critically endangered"" species.  There are just 400 of them left in the world - and most of those are in Cambodia. Given their dwindling population in the wild, ""the hatching of 60 new crocodiles is a tremendous boost,"" said Pablo Sinovas, who leads the Cambodia programme of conservation group Fauna & Flora. He added that this was hugely encouraging for ""collaborative conservation efforts"" - in this case the efforts have involved conservationists, local NGOs and the Cambodian government.   The crocs were feared to be extinct until they were rediscovered in Cambodia in 2000. Mr Sinovas says it Fauna & Flora has since worked with local officials to set up a programme to breed them in captivity before releasing them into suitable habitats across the Cardamom Mountains. Local community wardens patrol crisscross mountains in regular patrols to ensure that the crocodiles are safe after release. Since 2012, the programme has successfully let 196 Siamaese crocs back into the wild. In May locals discovered nests in an area where the crocodiles had not been released before, suggesting that the species have been breeding in their natural habitat. The conservation team then dispatched people to make sure the nests were protected round the clock - until all the eggs hatched, bringing 60 baby Siamese crocs into the world.

521,Man Utd sign Yoro from Lille in £52m deal,"Leny Yoro played for Lille against Aston Villa in the Europa Conference League last season Manchester United have signed French defender Leny Yoro from Lille until 2029 in a deal worth 62m euros (£52.18m), with 8m euros (£6.73m) in add-ons. The 18-year-old centre-back has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with the option for an additional 12 months. Yoro, who made his Lille debut at the age of 16, had been linked with Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain, while Liverpool were also interested in him. He played 32 times in the league last season and scored two goals as he helped Lille finish fourth and and was named in the Ligue 1 team of the season. ""Signing for a club with the stature and ambition of Manchester United so early in my career is an incredible honour,"" said Yoro. ""Since my first conversations with the club, they set out a clear plan for how I can develop in Manchester as part of this exciting project, and showed a lot of care for me and my family. ""I know about the history of young players at Manchester United and feel it can be the perfect place to reach my potential and achieve my ambitions, together with my new team-mates. I cannot wait to get started."" Yoro made 44 appearances in all competitions for the Ligue 1 side, who reached the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League before being knocked out on penalties by Aston Villa. Yoro's arrival follows United's recent signing of forward Joshua Zirkzee, 23, in a £36.5m deal from Italian side Bologna and comes during a summer in which the club have been trying to bring in a central defender. ""Leny is one of the most exciting young defenders in world football; he possesses every attribute needed to develop into a top-class centre-back,"" said United sporting director Dan Ashworth. United have lodged two bids with Everton for Jarrad Branthwaite but both have been rejected, with the Merseysiders understood to value him in excess of £75m. In addition, United have been negotiating with Bayern Munich for their Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt. Sources say while the club remain interested in Branthwaite and De Ligt, they would not sign both and further arrivals are likely to depend on squad space and available funds. Raphael Varane left the club at the end of the season and there are doubts over the future of Sweden's Victor Lindelof, whose contract expires next year. Harry Maguire was the subject of bids from rival Premier League clubs last summer but opted to remain at Old Trafford and eventually made 22 Premier League appearances. Simon Stone, Chief football news reporter There are some familiar noises coming out of Old Trafford in the wake of this transfer. Yoro was linked with some major European clubs, including Real Madrid, and his quote in the statement accompanying the signing about United having a ""clear plan"" for his development and the ""care"" shown for the teenager and his family seemed pointed. It is not unusual for United - or anyone else for that matter - to stress the positives around a new arrival. But there is an underlying theme. In Raphael Varane - and more particularly Anthony Martial - United are replacing older, injury-prone, underperforming players, with youngsters of verve, energy and promise. United's new ownership structure want the club to feel like that, a shedding of its skin as part of a conviction better times are ahead. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is continuing to deliver but the time was always going to come when his new outlook would be tested. The faith placed in Yoro and Zirkzee is immense. It won't be long before we discover whether the faith is justified and this is going to be a different United, or just more of the same with different wrapping paper.

522,Potter ready for next job as he salutes Southgate,"Graham Potter played for clubs such as Stoke City and Southampton during his career Graham Potter says he is ""ready"" to return to football management amid reports he is being considered for the England job. Gareth Southgate resigned as manager on Tuesday, less than 48 hours after England lost 2-1 to Spain in the Euro 2024 final. Potter, 49, is being tipped as a viable successor to Southgate, with other possible contenders including Newcastle's Eddie Howe and England Under-21 coach Lee Carsley. Potter has not managed in football since he was sacked by Chelsea in April 2023. The former Ostersund, Swansea and Brighton boss said he had spoken to a number of clubs but was waiting for the ""right opportunity"". ""Now I'm in that good place where I'm happy to be ready and looking forward to the next challenge,"" Potter told Sky Sports., external ""I've had a great break. The journey from where I started to where I finished doesn't come for free. It involves moving three countries, with a young family, and all that comes with being a football manager. ""It was important for me to take a break, reflect and re-energise. ""It's been a good time to look at other things, other sports, other teams and visit places. ""I feel really ready, really excited to be back when the right opportunity comes."" The best photos from Euro 2024 Which Euro 2024 stars could move this summer? Potter's first managerial appointment came in 2008 at Leeds Carnegie. Potter was asked directly about the England job when he received an honorary doctorate from Leeds Beckett University on Thursday. He told BBC Radio Leeds ""today was not the day"" to discuss it but that Southgate had ""done a fantastic job"" and ""there isn't anyone in the country more respected in football than Gareth"". Southgate was England manager for almost eight years. In that time he led the men's team to a World Cup quarter-final and semi-final and back-to-back Euros finals.

523,Nadal continues Olympic preparations with win against Norrie,"Rafael Nadal is a two-time Olympic gold medallist Rafael Nadal's preparations for the Olympics continued with an impressive straight-set win over Britain's Cameron Norrie in the second round of the Swedish Open. Nadal, 38, overcame the fifth seed in Bastad 6-4 6-4 to set up a quarter-final with Argentine Mariono Navone. The Spaniard decided to miss Wimbledon to focus on the Olympics in Paris this summer - where he will play singles and doubles with Carlos Alcaraz. Nadal, who is set to play in the doubles semi-final with Casper Ruud on Saturday, broke Norrie once in the first set to claim the lead. After receiving medical treatment on his arm because of a heavy fall at the start of the second set, Nadal was broken by an improving Norrie. But Nadal, who was trailing 4-1, then reeled off five games in a row to book his spot in the last eight with his best performance of the season. ""Great feelings, it's been a while without playing on the Tour since Roland Garros and I had a chance to compete against a great player like Cameron,"" said Nadal.  ""It's part of the journey today. I haven't been competing very often so matches like today help and holding the pressure on the opponent for the whole game is something I need to improve on because I haven't played enough.""",2024-07-18 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cglkep7xj3go,Charlotte Coates,2024-07-18 16:10:10,
524,Pope century gives England upper hand on Windies,"This video can not be played Watch highlights from day one of the second Test Second Rothesay Test (day one of five), Trent Bridge England 416: Pope 121, Duckett 71, Stokes 69; A Joseph 3-98 West Indies: Yet to bat Scorecard Ollie Pope’s sparkling century led England to 416 on a hectic first day of the second Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge. Number-three Pope arrived with the hosts 0-1 and caressed 121, adding 105 for the second wicket with Ben Duckett, who scored rapidly in the first hour. Opener Duckett may have to leave this match if his partner goes into labour and batted like a man in a hurry, hitting the first four legal deliveries he faced for four. He was threatening England’s fastest century in Test cricket until he was dismissed for 71 from 59 balls. Pope took advantage of being dropped on 46 and 54 to reach three figures from 143 balls, before captain Ben Stokes made a welcome 69. The skipper was one of a number of England batters who found a way to get out, particularly to off-spinner Kevin Sinclair and left-armer Kavem Hodge. In a chaotic end to the day, England lost their last five wickets for 74 runs, West Indies took their tally of drops to four and Mark Wood survived a stumping chance off Hodge. Wood and Chris Woakes pushed England past 400, then the latter and Shoaib Bashir fell in successive overs, Bashir to the final ball of the day. England, 1-0 up and with the chance to win the series, are in a strong position, but one that could have been stronger. Ramsdale is my lucky charm, says England's Pope Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Ollie Pope performs at Trent Bridge This video can not be played Sinclair celebrates Brook wicket with somersault There was enough action and incident on a sun-soaked first day in Nottingham to fill an entire Test. It marked the start of a new England era - this is their first home Test without James Anderson and Stuart Broad since 2012. Anderson is part of the England staff and Broad was honoured by the Pavilion End of his old home ground being renamed after him. Trent Bridge is where Bazball was born with the thrilling run chase against New Zealand in 2022. When the Windies won the toss, they gave England the chance to score quickly in beautiful conditions, albeit if Stokes was undecided over what he would have chosen. The tourists’ decision looked a good one as Zak Crawley was out to the third ball of the match, but apart from Sinclair’s somersault to celebrate his removal of Harry Brook – Sinclair is playing in place of the ill Gudakesh Motie – it was mainly downhill for West Indies from that point. The visitors’ pace bowling was wayward, their catching wasteful and ground-fielding sloppy, while Shamar Joseph again struggled with a left-leg injury. England had their share of poor moments, most glaringly the shots to get out by Joe Root and Brook, the latter who had also been dropped by Alick Athanaze. In between was some glorious strokeplay, not England going at full throttle, instead skilfully taking advantage of West Indian generosity, small boundaries and a lightning outfield. It was breathless stuff and terrific entertainment as England gained the platform for their new-look attack to examine the fragile West Indian batting on Friday. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Ollie Pope's century against West Indies Pope’s 57 in the first Test ended a run of eight England innings without a half-century, going back to his epic 196 that helped defeat India in Hyderabad in January. Arriving in the first over after Crawley edged Alzarri Joseph to a diving Athanaze at third slip, Pope punched the third ball he faced through mid-on for four. For some time, Pope was in the shadow of Duckett, who was on course to beat Gilbert Jessop’s 122-year-old record for the fastest England Test ton, made off 76 balls. Playing sweet cover-drives, Duckett reached 50 from 32 balls, only to be frustrated by his poke to second slip off Shamar Joseph. Pope’s moments of fortune came either side of lunch. Gully Athanaze could not hold a powerful cut off the bowling of Jayden Seales, then Jason Holder put down a straightforward chance at second slip off Shamar Joseph. Reprieved, Pope favoured the leg side. His 83rd run was his first in front of square on the off side. The England vice-captain pulled Seales for four to reach his second Test hundred on this ground and sixth overall, all made against different opponents. It was his fifth since being promoted to number three, the most by an England batter in that position since Jonathan Trott. When Pope gave a third chance, edging a drive at Alzarri Joseph, first-slip Hodge finally clung on. This video can not be played Watch the best shots of Stokes' half-century For as much as this was a very good day for England, it could have been better. Of the top-order, only Crawley was undone by good bowling and even the trio that passed fifty will feel like they left runs out there. Still, this was a timely knock for Stokes. For all of the attention on the captain’s return to bowling, he had registered five successive single-figure scores in Tests. Whereas Duckett started rapidly and slowed, Stokes began with patience and accelerating. The skipper had only six from his first 22 deliveries, then scored more quickly as West Indies tested him against the short ball. Stokes’ next 44 runs came from 49 balls as he reached 50 from 71. Stokes had a century at his mercy but picked out deep mid-wicket to give Hodge his first Test wicket and begin the frantic finish to the day. Jamie Smith’s cameo of 36 ended when he hit Hodge to mid-off, then Gus Atkinson edged Sinclair to slip. Wood had one when he missed Hodge, only for Joshua da Silva to fluff the stumping, and two when he slashed Sinclair to point, where Mikyle Louis dropped the catch. Woakes, in his 50th Test, played nicely for 37 before West Indies belatedly took the second new ball. Woakes edged Seales and Bashir edged Alzarri Joseph, Holder taking both catches at second slip. Former England captain Sir Alastair on BBC Test Match Special: ""It's hard to say England have missed out when they got 400 runs, but it does feel like they are a few short. You would think 450 would have been par on that wicket, wouldn't you? ""We will know a lot more an hour into tomorrow about how England will bowl on this surface."" West Indies spinner Kevin Sinclair, speaking to BBC Test Match Special: ""We did brilliant. It was too many runs in the end but I would say it was a good day for us as a team.

The world number 272, playing in his first Open after only qualifying two weeks ago, nonchalantly knocked in an eight-footer at 21:35 BST to complete a stunning bogey-free six-under 65. The 29-year-old, from North Yorkshire, is one ahead of 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry, who also posted a bogey-free round in wet and windy conditions on the Ayrshire coast. American Justin Thomas, with seven birdies in his round of 68, is two behind Irishman Lowry. Justin Rose, who came through qualifying, closed with 11 straight pars and is in a group of seven on two under. The 43-year-old, who says he will ""keep believing"" he can win an Open, is joined on that mark by, among others, fellow Englishman Joe Dean, European Ryder Cup players Alex Noren and Nicolai Hojgaard and American Xander Schauffele. Matt Wallace briefly led on four under after a birdie on the short eighth, but a wayward drive on the ninth led to a triple-bogey seven and he is in a group on one under with English compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick, world number one Scottie Scheffler and Australia's Adam Scott. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, winner of last week's Scottish Open, opened with a one-over 72, one ahead of Spain's Jon Rahm and four better than England's Tommy Fleetwood. But it was a dispiriting opening for Rory McIlroy, who slumped to a seven-over 78 and is 12 shots off the lead. The world number two said it ""was one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions"" and that his approach on Friday would be ""to focus on trying to make the cut"". That will also be the target for three-time champion Tiger Woods, who conceded he needed to ""do a lot more work in the gym to progress and play more"" after bogeying the last in posting a 79. 'McIlroy left in grim major battle after another tale of woe' The Open - round one leaderboard How round one of The Open unfolded This video can not be played Watch: McIlroy struggles in difficult first round at The Open While Woods' round was perhaps not unexpected given his recent injury problems, McIlroy's came a little out of the blue. He has performed well in the majors over the past three years, with eight top-10 placings in 11 starts, including last month's runner-up finish at the US Open. The 35-year-old was at level par after seven holes on Thursday, a birdie on the third cancelling out a dropped shot on the first. But the four-time major champion found trouble on Troon's two iconic holes. His tee shot to the 118-yard par-three eighth 'Postage Stamp' landed on the green but trickled off right into a bunker and he took two to escape from the sand as he posted a five. The Northern Irishman then sliced his tee shot on the par-four 11th 'Railway' on to the train track, carding a six on what has been the hardest hole in each of the past three Opens held here. A run of three pars followed but the emotion spilled out after he hit his second shot on the par-four 15th into one of Troon's many penal pot bunkers. He found another on the last. Both led to bogeys. McIlroy came to Royal Troon on the back of a solid performance at last week's Scottish Open, where he finished joint-fourth, but is perhaps still bearing the scars of his collapse at last month's US Open, where he dropped three shots in the closing four holes to lose by one to Bryson DeChambeau. American DeChambeau also failed to sparkle in the dreary conditions. He was five over after seven and dropped another shot at the eighth. ""I could have thrown in the towel after nine and been like, I'm going home,"" he said. The two-time major winner was seven over after bogeying the 15th but he was smiling after converting a 55-foot putt for eagle on the next, ending on five over. ""I'm proud of the way I persevered. I've got a chance, I'm excited for the challenge,"" he added. This video can not be played 'Big problems' for McIlroy on the eighth hole Also excited for the challenge ahead is surprise leader Brown, who had two birdies in his final three holes to pass Lowry.  He was playing in the next-to-last group out on the course and played through the gloaming to complete his round. ""It did get dark out there and a little bit tricky but the wind dropped as well,"" he said. ""You've got those bright yellow scoreboards out there so it's hard to miss, but I felt comfortable with my game. ""I'm very excited, but you've got to keep your feet on the ground, so I'm just going to go out and do the best I can [on Friday]."" Lowry's 66 is his lowest round in a major - the last time he was under par after round one at an Open, he won it, at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. ""That doesn't mean anything, that was five years ago,"" Lowry said. After opening with three pars, he holed three birdies in his next five holes to join Thomas, who had been among the early wave of players on day one, at the top of the leaderboard. A further birdie followed on the 11th before another at the last. ""This is a great start but if I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today,"" he said. This video can not be played Thomas finishes round with back-to-back birdies Thomas, who has won two US PGA Championship titles, rolled in four of his seven birdies on the front nine, including one on the eighth after coming within eight inches of holing his tee shot. He overcame ""a bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine"" when a wild drive on the 12th cost him two shots and another went on the next, but said he was rewarded for staying ""patient"" with his closing pair of birdies. ""There are a lot of variables that you can't control on links golf,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I feel like over 72 holes, you're going to have some things not go the way you want and I’m just trying to stay as even keel as possible.""",2024-07-18 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c1vdz6nzr4lo,Peter Scrivener,2024-07-18 23:10:10,
526,Man City sign Brazil winger Savinho in £30m deal,"Savio scored nine goals and made 10 assists in 37 La Liga games for Girona last season Manchester City have signed Brazil winger Savinho from French side Troyes until 2029 in a deal worth 40m euros (£30.8m). The 20-year-old starred on loan at Girona last season as they finished third in La Liga. Both Girona and Troyes are part of the City Football Group. Savinho said City are currently the ""best team in the world"" and that he is excited to work under manager Pep Guardiola, who he called ""one of the greatest coaches ever"". On why Manchester City is the right club for him, Savinho said: ""[Because of] everything I've seen today. I just got here this morning and I turned to my agent and stepfather and said, 'there was no way I was going to turn down Manchester City'.  ""I'm a Brazilian who likes to play on the front foot, to be happy, to play joyful football. ""I like playing one against one, making assists, scoring goals too, and helping the team. My main characteristic, what I like the most, is being happy and getting fans up off their seats."" Savinho, who is also known as Savio, started his career at Brazilian side Atletico Mineiro before joining Troyes in the summer of 2022. He never played a competitive game for the Ligue 2 side, though, as he was sent on loan to PSV Eindhoven for the 2022-23 season. After making just eight appearances for the Dutch giants, Savinho enjoyed success on loan at Girona last season, scoring 11 goals and making 10 assists in all competitions, and earned a first senior call-up for Brazil in March. A debut against England followed and he scored his first international goal against Paraguay in the group stage of the Copa America. City director of football Txiki Begiristain added: ""He has a big role to play for Manchester City this season and beyond. ""We are totally confident in his ability. He is still young and has the potential to become even better, and everyone knows that Pep is the best at helping players develop even further. ""But he has already shown his huge quality and technical ability and is an exciting addition to our attacking area.""

527,Marseille sign Man Utd forward Greenwood,"Mason Greenwood was Getafe's player of the season last campaign Marseille have signed forward Mason Greenwood from Manchester United until 2029 in a deal worth up to 31.6m euros (£26.6m). Greenwood, 22, was a product of United's academy but has not played for the Premier League club since January 2022 and was on loan at Getafe last season. Serious charges against him, including attempted rape and assault, were dropped in February 2023.  The French club were criticised by the Marseille mayor after their intention to sign Greenwood was made public. He made his competitive senior debut for United in 2019 as a substitute against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League. He scored 35 goals in 129 appearances and won his only England cap in 2020. In August 2023, United said Greenwood would leave the club by mutual agreement after a six-month internal investigation into his conduct. He joined La Liga side Getafe the following month, where he scored 10 goals and made six assists in 36 appearances to revive his career. United, who wished Greenwood well on their website, have also included a sizeable sell-on clause in their deal with Marseille. Marseille face Sunderland in a pre-season friendly on 3 August at Bradford City's Valley Parade, with the Stadium of Light unavailable because of renovation work.  Greenwood was born in Bradford and it could be his first game back in England since he was arrested in January 2022 following allegations surrounding material which was published online.

530,Biden vows to run as more Democrats ask him to drop out,"US President Joe Biden is looking forward to ""getting back on the campaign trail next week"", fortifying his commitment to stick in the race as more Democrats on Friday called for him to step aside as the party nominee.   “The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win,"" he said. His statement appeared to be in response to the conflicting reports that Mr Biden's inner circle is discussing the beleaguered president's future and whether he will remain in the race.  Over the last several weeks, Mr Biden has been caught in a whirlwind of political pressure to step down: Calls from leaders within his own party to withdraw from the race, a loss of big-ticket donors and the added pressure that his decision could cost Democrats control of Congress.  At least a dozen Democratic lawmakers have called for him to step aside on Friday alone, and Vice-President Kamala Harris - considered the top choice to replace Mr Biden - was tasked with comforting worried donors on a Friday afternoon call.  Ms Harris said that she believed ""in my heart of hearts"" that ""we are going to win this election"", an individual who listened to the conversation told the BBC.  ""We know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: Our president, Joe Biden,"" she added. Earlier in the day, Mr Biden’s re-election campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon also attempted to push back on speculation that the president would withdraw in an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe “Absolutely, the president’s in this race,” she said when asked about Mr Biden's plans.  She described him as ""more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump"" and said he's the ""best person"" to take on the former president. In his statement, the president referenced former President Trump's Republican National Convention speech to say he will continue ""exposing the threat"" of the former president while ""making the case"" for his record.  ""Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,"" he said.  As the conflict played on on Friday, the president was under quarantine at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He tested positive for Covid-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week. Mr Biden is experiencing “mild symptoms”, the White House said.  Since his poor debate performance last month, Mr Biden has insisted he will continue to run, though his perspective on what it would take for him to step down as the Democratic nominee has evolved.  First telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos ""only the Lord Almighty"" would make him stand down, Mr Biden said this week during an interview with BET (Black Entertainment Television) that he would re-evaluate the campaign if a doctor told him he had a serious medical condition.  According to a campaign memo released on Friday, Mr Biden isn't going anywhere.  ""Joe Biden has made it more than clear: He’s in this race and he’s in it to win it,"" according to the memo. ""Moreover, he’s the presumptive nominee — there is no plan for an alternative nominee. In a few short weeks, Joe Biden will be the official nominee. It is high past time we stop fighting one another. The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump."" Time is running out for Mr Biden to decide if he will step down. The Democratic National Convention begins 19 August, but the Democratic National Committee is expected to meet virtually the first week of August to nominate Biden as the official party nominee to meet state ballot deadlines.  The DNC rules committee met on Friday morning to discuss the procedures for the virtual roll-call vote, which they intend to hold before 7 August.  When asked whether another candidate could challenge Mr Biden in the roll-call vote, the committee's co-chair Leah Daughtry said that ""any challenger would have to have the verified support of hundreds of delegates"". With Mr Biden winning nearly all of the available delegates during the Democratic primary, that requirement would be nearly insurmountable.  Ms Daughtry noted that ""such a challenge has never happened over the past half century of competitive primaries"". The pressure continues to build, however. On Friday, Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, of New Mexico, became the third Democrat in the upper chamber to call for Biden to step aside. ""By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to united behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,"" he wrote in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.  His statement follows that of Democratic Senator Jon Tester, of Montana, who called on Biden to end his re-election bid on Thursday.  ""While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,"" Mr Tester wrote in a statement on X. In the House, Congressman Jim Costa, a Democrat from California, also called for him to withdraw on Thursday.  Democratic congressmen Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin released a joint message on Friday saying ""the most responsible and patriotic thing"" Biden could do is ""step aside as our nominee"".  ""With great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,"" they wrote in the joint statement.  Illinois Democratic congressman Sean Casten wrote in the Chicago Tribune on Friday that he doesn't think the president can defeat former US President Donald Trump.  ""It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,"" he wrote.  Other members of the House joined the calls for the president to step aside on Friday, including Zoe Lofgren of California, Kathy Castor of Florida, Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky, Greg Landsman of Ohio and Betty McCollum of Minnesota. Reports this week suggested senior Democratic leaders are leaning in the same direction.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns during private conversations with Mr Biden about his candidacy. In public statements, Ms Pelosi's staff insisted her comments have been misrepresented and Mr Jeffries affirmed his support for Mr Biden. Former President Barack Obama, Mr Biden's previous running mate, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished. Lawmakers haven't been the only ones turning their backs to Biden. Big name donors - including actor George Clooney and Disney family heiress Abigail Disney - have closed their wallets.   Despite the defectors, some are sticking by his side.  New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most influential progressive voices in the House, has supported Biden over the last few weeks. She broadcast live on Instagram on Friday morning and spoke about the risks of entering the convention without Biden as the presumptive nominee, including potential legal challenges and ballot access deadlines.  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, have both met with the president and also indicated their support for his re-election bid.

531,Global services slowly recovering after bug causes IT chaos,"Businesses and services around the world are slowly recovering after a massive IT outage affected computer systems for hours on Thursday and Friday. Businesses, banks, hospitals and airlines were among the worst-hit after cyber-security firm Crowdstrike issued a faulty software update which affected Microsoft Windows. Crowdstrike's CEO apologised for the disruption and said a fix had been issued, but admitted it could be ""some time"" before all systems were back up and running. While some airline services are beginning to return to normal after thousands of flights were cancelled, operators expect some delays and cancellations to persist through the weekend. Many businesses are now dealing with backlogs and missed orders that could take days to resolve. Health services in Britain, Israel and Germany also suffered problems, with some operations cancelled. The global chaos has sparked concern over the vulnerability of the world's interconnected technologies, and the extent to which a single software glitch could have such widespread impact. The issue began at 19:00 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running cybersecurity software CrowdStrike Falcon, according to Microsoft, though the full extent of the problem only became clear by Friday morning. But by Friday evening, the problems were easing in many parts of the globe, with many airports saying that while there were still issues with check-in and payment systems, most flights were now running. And the website Downdetector, which detects sites which may be having tech issues, showed fewer sites in the UK which were experiencing problems by the end of the day. Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said on X that a defect was found ""in a single content update for Windows hosts"". ""We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our company,"" he told the NBC network. ""Many of the customers are rebooting the system and it's coming up and it'll be operational. ""It could be some time for some systems that just automatically won't recover, but it is our mission... to make sure every customer is fully recovered.""  Microsoft has also said that several reboots may be required, with some users reporting that as many as 15 could be needed before the problem is fixed. Also, tech experts say Crowdstrike's fix will have to be applied separately to each and every device affected. Questions are likely now to be raised about Crowdstrike's influence as one of the largest operators in the cyber-security market and the wisdom of having such a crucial part of the industry controlled by just a small number of companies. Crowdstrike's shares fell by around 12% on Friday, at the expense of rivals SentinelOne and Palo Alto Networks. The problems were first noticed in Australia, and possibly felt most severely in the air travel industry. Airports saw delays, with long queues as flights were cancelled or delayed, aircraft grounded and passengers stranded. Some saw extra staff drafted in to check in passengers manually. By 18:00 GMT, aviation data from Cirium suggested that more than 4,000 flights - or 3.9% of the total - had been cancelled so far on Friday, though the figure may also include flights cancelled for other reasons. Payment systems, banking and healthcare providers around the world were affected. It is thought the outage may also have a longer term effect as companies struggle to pay wages to staff, particularly where payments are made on a weekly basis. Some railway companies warned of delays, and broadcasters Sky News and ABC Australia both experienced outages.",2024-07-19 23:10:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3m4jgdprxo,"Robert Greenall,",2024-07-19 22:16:20,
528,Bangladesh imposes curfew as protests continue,"Authorities in Bangladesh have imposed a nationwide curfew, after further rioting in the capital Dhaka left an additional 35 people dead. Days of violence have been sparked by students calls for the government to axe a rule reserving scores of public jobs for the families of veterans of the country's independence war in 1971. The prime minister's office announced the curfew after an attack on the Narsingdi prison on Friday saw hundreds of inmates released. Government Press Secretary Naeemul Islam Khan said the army would be deployed to the streets in a bid to restore order.   ""The government has decided to impose a curfew and deploy the military in aid of the civilian authorities,"" he said in a statement.  Some 67 people have now died since violence broke out - although the exact toll is difficult to assess due in part to an almost complete communications shutdown, with mobile internet and telephone lines reportedly down. Bus and train services have reportedly also been halted, while photos from Dhaka show large numbers of police in riot gear on the streets. Schools and universities across Bangladesh have also been shut until further notice. But this has done little to stop the protesters, who vowed to continue with their own ""Complete Shutdown"", which has seen them blockade roads across the city. On Friday, students chanting ""merit, merit"" and ""we won't let the blood that has been shed of our brothers go in vain"" were joined by a number of parents outside Dhaka university. The students are arguing that the quota system is discriminatory, and are asking for recruitment based on merit. Critics say the system unfairly benefits the families of pro-government groups who support Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won her fourth straight election in January. A march organised by Islamist parties was met with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Protestors also stormed the Narsingdi district jail on Friday, where several hundred inmates were reported to have escaped onto the streets. Multiple witnesses confirmed the incident to BBC Bangla. The main opposition Bangladesh National Party has also called for protest, with the exiled acting chairman Tarique Rahman asking people to support ""these tender-hearted students"" in a post on Twitter. The party said one of its senior leaders, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed,  had been taken into custody. Police did not give any reasons for Mr Rizvi’s arrest. Attempts to end the protests with talks have so far failed. Law Minister Anisul Haque told BBC Bangla the government was open to discussing the issues: “I'm sure they are also discussing whether they will come to the talks or not.” But student Nahid Iqbal told the BBC on Thursday they would not consider joining the talks at present. ""The government has killed so many people in a day that we cannot join any discussions in the current circumstances."" Earlier, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Shafiqul Islam told the BBC that authorities had decided to ban rallies in the city in order to protect lives and property following Thursday's violence. Separately, the police confirmed to BBC Bangla that two people had died on Friday. Police said 100 officers had been injured on Thursday, while a government minister said several vehicles parked outside government buildings were set on fire. The clashes have also not been confined to Dhaka, with 26 districts reporting incidents. The protesters who occupied and set light to the state broadcaster BTV had left by Friday morning, although the channel had not started broadcasting again. A senior reporter told BBC Bangla the newsroom, studio and canteen had all been damaged in Thursday's fire.

529,Russia jails US journalist Gershkovich for 16 years,"US journalist Evan Gershkovich has been found guilty of espionage by a Russian court and sentenced to 16 years in a high-security penal colony, after a secretive trial decried as a ""sham"" by his employer, his family and the White House. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter was first arrested last March while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow, by security services. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), accusations that Gershkovich, the WSJ and the US vociferously deny. It marks the first conviction of a US journalist for espionage in Russia since the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago.  Both sides in the trial have 15 days to appeal against the verdict, the judge said. “This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist,” Wall Street Journal publisher Almar Latour and Editor in Chief Emma Tucker said in a statement. “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family.  “Journalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he’s released. This must end now.” Western politicians have roundly condemned the verdict. US President Joe Biden said Mr Gershkovich had ""committed no crime"" and was ""targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American"".  ""Evan has endured his ordeal with remarkable strength,"" Mr Biden added. ""Journalism is not a crime. We will continue to stand strong for press freedom in Russia and worldwide, and stand against all those who seek to attack the press or target journalists."" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Russia was punishing journalism with its ""politicised legal system"", and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the sentence as ""despicable"". Washington accuses Russia of holding Gershkovich as a bargaining chip, to be used for a possible prisoner swap with Russian citizens in foreign jails. But Moscow knows that the US is prepared to make swaps in order to release its own citizens, and the two countries are known to have been discussing such a swap. Russian observers say a quick conviction could mean that an exchange is imminent. According to Russian judicial practice, an exchange generally requires a verdict to be in place already. In February Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted at a possible exchange in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson. It is thought he was referring to Vadim Krasikov, a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) hitman serving a life sentence in Germany for shooting dead a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin. Evan Gershkovich's trial began last month, and the last two days' proceedings had originally been scheduled for August. Prosecutors had asked for an 18-year prison sentence. But in an unexpected move, the hearing was brought forward to Thursday, and the judge gave the verdict late on Friday afternoon. In a charging indictment, prosecutors accused Gershkovich, 32, of acting “under instructions from the CIA"" to collect ""secret information"" about a factory that produces tanks in the Sverdlovsk region.  The reporter has consistently denied the accusations, and in a statement on Thursday the WSJ called the trial a ""shameful sham"" and his detention an ""outrage"".  A number of other high-profile US citizens - including Paul Whelan - remain detained in Russian prisons. Mr Whelan was detained in 2018 and accused of espionage.  In his statement on Thursday Mr Biden said he had ""no higher priority than seeking the release and safe return of Evan, Paul Whelan and all Americans wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad"".",2024-07-19 23:10:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg64npg33r3o,"Matt Murphy,",2024-07-19 16:10:20,
547,Serbian suspect held over killing of Rolls-Royce designer,"A 22-year old Serbian man has been arrested in France a week after the fatal stabbing in Germany of a 74-year-old man, named locally as former Rolls-Royce car designer Ian Cameron. Bavarian police said that after a public manhunt the suspect had been located in a flat to the north-east of Paris and arrested by French special forces on Thursday. Ian Cameron, 74, was reportedly attacked last Friday night at his home in Herrsching, south-west of Munich. His wife fled to a neighbour's house and raised the alarm. Police later released an image of the suspect taken in a local supermarket before the killing. They said the man had been in the Herrsching area for several hours. Ian Cameron moved to the lakeside village of Herrsching 11 years ago. Former Rolls-Royce colleagues have said they are deeply shocked by what happened. Police have not publicly named him as the victim and have not suggested why he might have been targeted. After police found his body they searched neighbouring gardens and roads close to the east bank of Lake Ammersee with a helicopter and police dogs. The suspect is thought to have escaped on foot and police warned the public not to approach him themselves. A red backpack was later found next to the lake and other objects were found during a search of woodland close to the victim's house. Images of the outside of the victim's house indicated that a cable powering an outdoor security camera had been cut. In a statement on Friday Bavarian police said that after a week-long manhunt a suspect had been detained. They said the man had escaped to Munich and then travelled to Innsbruck in Austria and through Zurich to France. The Serbian suspect was alone in an apartment near Paris when he was detained by French special forces and offered no resistance, they added. He is due to appear before an investigating magistrate in France on Friday. The chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Chris Brownridge, said this week that his thoughts were with Ian Cameron's family and friends. ""[Ian Cameron] led the design team for all Phantom family and Ghost models, creating thoroughly contemporary motor cars that remained sympathetic to the marque’s design,"" he said.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czk0pm5en31o,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-19 10:10:21,
546,Five takeaways from Trump's convention speech,"After a tumultuous few weeks that have upended American politics, Donald Trump pitched a message of unity and strength as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination for the third time on Thursday night. Trump appeared after Kid Rock delivered a version of his song American Bad Ass, an introduction from Ultimate Fighting Championship chief Dana White, a shirt-ripping endorsement from wrestling legend Hulk Hogan and a singalong version of his rally anthem God Bless the USA.  His name was written in giant lights behind him as he strode on stage.  But after that bombastic introduction, the former president seemed relatively subdued as he spoke - often veering off-script - to the Republican faithful for more than 90 minutes. He told the hushed crowd in detail about the recent attempt on his life, suggesting he had been saved by divine intervention.  But despite stressing a message of national togetherness he could not resist sharp jibes at Democratic party leaders. Here are five takeaways: Trump began his speech by recounting his experience of last Saturday's attack. ""As you already know, the assassin’s bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life,"" he told the assembled Republican delegates. He said he turned his head slightly to view a chart about immigration projected on a  teleprompter screen. ""In order to see the chart, I started to - like this - turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which I’m very lucky I didn’t do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me, really, really hard, on my right ear. ""I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that - it can only be a bullet.'"" Trump called the Secret Service agents who rushed the stage ""very brave"". ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,"" he said. ""Many people say it was a providential moment. It probably was."" He credited the crowd at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, for not panicking and causing a stampede. ""They just didn’t want to leave me, and you can see that love written all over their faces,"" he said.  Although his speech contained sharp criticism of Joe Biden's policies on several fronts, Trump made just one direct mention of his rival's name, calling him one of the worst presidents in history, as he frequently does at rallies. ""The damage he has done to this country is unthinkable,"" he said, ""just unthinkable."" Uncertainty continues to swirl around the future of Mr Biden's candidacy. On Wednesday, he was diagnosed with Covid-19 and is recuperating at his home in Delaware. Mr Biden has vowed to stay in the race, despite reports that leading Democrats, including Barack Obama, are now questioning his position, and a growing number of Congressional lawmakers have urged him to step aside for a new candidate.  Trump pledged to build the rest of the southern border wall, ""most of which I have already built"". That claim isn't accurate, with fewer than 500 miles (805km) constructed during his first term. He also painted a picture of massive inflation, saying ""groceries are up 50%, gasoline is up 60 to 70%, mortgage rates have quadrupled"". Inflation is a major issue to American voters, but since Mr Biden took office in January 2021 prices have risen by a total of about 20%.   Trump also mentioned at several points his baseless assertion that fraud in the 2020 election cost him the presidency.  The convention ended with the usual family gathering on stage. But Trump's clan is more than just a show - they are now truly Republican power brokers with the potential makings of a dynasty.   Trump's sons, Eric and Don Jr, were given high-profile speaking slots, and Don Jr was reportedly a key influence over his father's vice-presidential pick.  Earlier in the week Eric's wife, Lara Trump, took to the stage. As co-chair of the Republican National Committee, she will play a key role in the election campaign.   The convention also heard from little-known members of the clan, such as his eldest granddaughter, Kai Trump, a keen golfer. Aged 17, she will not be eligible to vote in November. Other Trumps had much lower profiles. Melania Trump turned up on the final night in a rare public appearance, but she did not take to the podium to speak as US candidates' wives usually do on such occasions. Neither did Trump's daughter Ivanka, who - with her husband Jared Kushner - only attended the convention on the final day. Once a close adviser to her father, she left politics after her father departed the White House. Trump generally attempted to continue the overall theme of national unity that kept coming up this week at the party convention - but at several points he digressed into sharp attacks on Democrats and their policies. Early on in the speech he told the crowd: ""Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, colour, and creed."" ""I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America."" Still, he could not resist ad-libbed lines criticising top Democrats and the leadership of the United Auto Workers, one of the country's largest unions. In addition to his criticism of President Biden, he called Nancy Pelosi - the former House speaker - ""crazy"". Referring to the legal cases against him, he said: ""They’ve got to stop that because they’re destroying our country."" Trump also demanded that ""the Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponising the justice system"".  Much as it has been throughout his political career, immigration was at the top of the agenda.   He called illegal immigration an ""invasion that is killing hundreds of thousands of people a year"" and promised the “largest deportation operation in the history of our country - even larger than that of President Dwight D Eisenhower many years ago"". More than one million Mexican immigrants were deported from the US in 1954. In a lengthy section of one of the longest convention speeches in memory, he blamed immigrants for crime, and said: ""We have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us, they think we're stupid.""

545,Living in cars and motels - what it's like to work at the 'Happiest Place on Earth',"Cynthia “Cyn” Carranza meticulously scavenged for a shady parking spot in the car she called home. The overnight custodian at Disneyland has to sleep during the day - a difficulty for anyone, let alone when you're living in your car with two dogs. Ms Carranza says she makes $20.65 an hour (about £15.99) at the park but last summer, she couldn't afford rent in this Southern California city where the average apartment can run more than $2,000 (about £1,550) a month. Ms Carranza teared up as she recounted the struggles of that summer, including sneaking for showers in Disneyland's costume department. She now shares a small apartment with her boyfriend, who also works at the park, but still makes barely enough to make ends meet. “That’s not something that anybody should experience working a full-time job for a company like Disney,” she told the BBC. Ms Carranza, like others who work at the park, detailed to the BBC the financial hardships that come with working at what’s supposed to be the “Happiest Place on Earth”. About 10,000 union workers at Disneyland - the first of 12 parks created around the globe - are threatening to strike over the wages and what they say are retaliatory anti-union practices. Hundreds of workers protested outside the park this week, with an array of signs and pins showing Mickey Mouse's gloved fist in defiance.  “Mickey would want fair pay,” workers chanted outside Disneyland near the park's gates.  They are voting on Friday on whether to authorize a strike, days before union contract negotiations for workers are set to resume.  A vote to authorise a strike does not mean a strike is imminent, but it could set workers up to act quickly if negotiations sour. Authorisation also gives the unions leverage as talks continue next week. The contract for cast members at Disneyland expired 16 June, and the current negotiations involves a coalition of unions that represent nearly 10,000 employees at the park, which includes everyone from those who work as characters and operate rides to sales, restaurant, and janitorial workers.  Union officials say about one in 10 Disneyland cast members have experienced homelessness while working at the park. A survey of employees showed 73% say they don't make enough to cover basic expenses each month and about a third said they experienced housing insecurity within the last year.  “We’re the ones who make the magic,” says L Slaughter, a host at the Toontown-themed part of the park. “We need Disney to pay us a liveable wage.” Ms Slaughter spent two years living in her car while working at the park. She now has a small apartment about an hour's drive from Disneyland.  She spent a lot of that time trying to find a safe parking spot to sleep, she says, adding that staff are not allowed to sleep in the Disneyland parking lots. “My rent just went up $200 and I won’t be able to make rent again,” she says. Ms Slaughter makes $19.90 an hour - thanks to a minimum wage mandate passed by city voters in 2018. Disney unsuccessfully fought the wage hike, but workers say it’s still not enough to survive in Southern California. A living wage calculator built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, says a single person with no children would need to be paid $30.48 an hour to afford to live near Disneyland in Orange County, which is about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Workers who talked to the BBC said they have kept their jobs at the park because they love the Disney brand, and they rely on the generous healthcare benefits and union-operated food bank, which some workers described as a saving-grace.  Disney says it is committed to negotiations with its “cast members” - the company's term for employees who play princesses and pirates as well as the chefs or janitors who maintain the park. ""We respect and value our cast members and recognize the important role they play in creating happiness for our guests,"" Disney said in a statement, adding that talks with the unions representing its workers will resume 22 July and they are committed to reaching a deal ""that focuses on what matters most to our current cast members, helps us attract new cast, and positions Disneyland Resort for growth and the creation of more jobs"". The last Disneyland strike was in 1984, and it lasted 22 days. Ms Carranza described the back-breaking work she does nightly at the park - cleaning, polishing, repairing floors and sometimes installing carpets. She said last summer living in her car was the lowest point in her life, and she credits her dogs with keeping her alive. “I know that they’re the reason why I’m still here, why I didn’t let go,"" she said. ""There were times when I questioned what I was doing here and how I was going to get back on my feet.""  But even with the small studio apartment Ms Carranza now has, she says she's still living paycheck-to-paycheck and sometimes can only afford to eat rice or noodles.  Although workers’ demands are economic, the vote to strike was called in response to complaints that workers were disciplined for wearing the Mickey badges and distributing union information in the park.  In June, the unions filed unfair labour practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney for “unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work.” Colleen Palmer, one of the negotiators from Local UFCW 324, has worked at Disneyland for nearly 37 years and makes almost $24 an hour as a “merchandise hostess”. She says she wore her union badge for less than half an hour before management told her to take it off. Palmer says workers are responsible for the experience that customers enjoy at Disneyland, and that her loyalty and experience should be rewarded. She said workers believe the pay gap between the workers and the company’s executives is outrageous: Disney CEO Bob Iger’s compensation was $31.6 million in 2023 - hundreds of times the amount Disneyland cast members earn. “It makes me wonder, why don’t you want to recognize me? Because I’m making you that money, so that you can buy that sports team now,” she said, referring to news that Mr Iger and his wife had taken over the LA women’s soccer team, Angel City Football Club. The disparity between workers pay and management has been fuelling labour unrest in the United States. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, CEO compensation rose 1,460 percent between 1978 and 2021. Disneyland is a unique workplace. Many consider it a career, not a job, and workers are often also fans of the Disney brand - some call it the cult of Disney. Workers get perks like free admission to Disney parks for their family and friends. But they also say Disney is not flexible when they have a family crisis or get sick. Many have second and third jobs that Disneyland's unpredictable schedules make challenging to juggle. For students and retirees working part-time, it can be a dream job, but it no longer provides a living wage for people in and around Anaheim, a wealthy city whose biggest employer is Disney, workers say. “Without us, Disney would be like anywhere else,” says Morgan, who lived in motels around Disneyland for four years with his children and wanted to be identified by his middle name only. The breakup of Morgan’s marriage caused him to lose his housing and cheap motels were all he could afford with his Disney wages.  When his children were with their mother, he often slept outside and hid in shadows to avoid police or theft.  He now has a second full-time job as a recruiter - which he can do from home - and an apartment he can afford with the combined income. Still, he takes pride in his job selling Disney merchandise and says every cast member takes the job seriously. “It’s not the animatronics - it’s us.  At least respect us enough to pay us a decent wage.”",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gpx7pnwdo,"Regan Morris,",2024-07-19 21:10:21,
544,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star Cheng Pei-pei dies at 78","China-born actress Cheng Pei-pei, who starred in Oscar-winning film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, has died in San Francisco at the age of 78. A pioneer of martial arts roles for female actors, Cheng became a major performer in action films after she starred in Come Drink with Me by King Hu in 1966. The film achieved critical acclaim and won Cheng international attention. After moving to the US she inspired a new generation of directors from East Asia to Hollywood to make female-driven swordplay films. Cheng's family said she had been privately battling a neurodegenerative brain disease with symptoms similar to Parkinson's since 2019 and passed away on Wednesday. “Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts... a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned over six decades, not only in Asia but internationally as well,” her family wrote on Facebook.  Born in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng moved to Hong Kong in 1962 and soon won acclaim as an actor with the release of Come Drink with Me. The film is considered one of the best examples of ""wuxia"" films - a period movie genre celebrating legendary martial artists from ancient China. In the film she played the role of Golden Swallow, the sister of an important leader who was kidnapped by a band of thugs. A kung-fu master, her character was dispatched to rescue her brother. The film, selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards, launched her career at the age of 19.  Coupled with its 1968 sequel, Golden Swallow, the role saw Cheng win scores of parts in martial arts films as a fearless swordswoman. Her character went on to establish the motif of the lone female assassin, sent out to seek revenge. The genre would heavily influence Quentin Tarantino’s box office hits, Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2.  Cheng moved to California in the early 1970s and played dozens of roles as an iconic action heroine during the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts films. Her biggest role came in 2000, in director Ang Lee's wuxia-inspired Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where she played the villain, Jade Fox. It was one of the first mainstream martial arts films to feature a female lead. The film became a global hit, winning 10 Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture. It earned $128 million at the North American box office and won Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, as well as at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs. It became the first foreign-language film to gross more than $100 million worldwide. Her final role was in the live-action Disney version of ""Mulan"" in 2020, where she played as the matchmaker to the eponymous heroine. Her Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon co-star Michelle Yeoh hailed Cheng in a message posted to Instagram. ""We will miss your kindness and shining talent,"" she wrote.   After her illness was diagnosed five years ago, Cheng chose not to make her condition public and instead spent time with her four children and grandchildren. Her family said she had requested that instead of flowers, donations be made to the Brain Support Network (BSN) where she donated her brain.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn38jrnp9jeo,"Lipika Pelham,",2024-07-19 17:10:21,
543,Israeli man killed in drone attack on Tel Aviv,"A man has been killed and at least eight people injured in a drone attack in central Tel Aviv, Israel. A block of flats was hit by what an Israeli military official said was an Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which had been modified to fly long distance. The Houthi movement in Yemen - over 1,000 miles (1,600km) away - said it carried out the attack, and vowed to stage more. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said an initial investigation pointed to the attack having originated in Yemen. If the Houthis are responsible, it would mark a significant escalation in their attacks on Israel which began in the wake of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. Until now, almost all Houthi missiles and drones fired towards Israel have been intercepted. None are known to have reached Tel Aviv. The Israeli military official said its defence forces had detected the incoming drone but had not tried to shoot it down because of ""human error"".  Dramatic video filmed from the beach, said to capture the moment of the attack, appears to show a drone flying in over the Mediterranean Sea and buzzing loudly. It flies over buildings before disappearing, followed by a huge explosion moments later.  Pictures from the scene of the blast, near a branch of the US embassy, show a building with its windows blown out, and damaged cars and debris on the street below. Local media named the man who was killed as Yevgeny Ferder, 50, who moved to Israel from Belarus two years ago. The attack happened at 03:12 (00:12 GMT) and the explosion was heard for several miles around. The Times of Israel news site quoted the Israeli Air Force as saying the incident ""shouldn't have happened"", and that it took full responsibility for the failure to prevent it. Senior military correspondent for the Jerusalem Post, Yonah Jeremy Bob, said ""The Israeli defense establishment is in a state of complete shock"" over the attack. ""Though the writing was on the wall, no one saw it coming from a couple thousand kilometers away,"" he wrote. Following the incident, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant held a security briefing with the country's security chiefs. ""The defense establishment is working to reinforce all defense mechanisms and will bring to justice anyone who harms the State of Israel,” Mr Gallant said afterwards. He hinted at possible retaliation, saying they had discussed ""intelligence and operational activities required against those responsible for the attack”. A military spokesman for the Houthis, Yahya Saree, said the strike had been conducted with a new drone capable of bypassing interception systems. He declared Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, ""an unsafe area,"" and said it ""will be a primary target within the range of our weapons"". The Israeli military said it was increasing air patrols, while Tel Aviv's mayor said the city was on high alert, local media reported. Alon, a local resident, told Haaretz newspaper that when the blast happened ""the whole building shook.""  ""My neighbours' windows shattered, so I was sure something had hit the building. It was only when I went outside that I realised that several buildings had been damaged."" The incident also came after the Israeli military confirmed it had killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire across the border since Hezbollah launched rockets a day after Israel began its military offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's deadly attack on Israel. Hezbollah and the Houthis, which are both backed by Iran, say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06kdk6z08lo,"Raffi Berg,",2024-07-19 11:10:21,
542,Judge sets Harvey Weinstein retrial date for November,"A judge in New York has set a tentative retrial date for Harvey Weinstein for 12 November after the disgraced film mogul's rape conviction was overturned in April. New York State Supreme Court Judge Curtis Farber said during a hearing on Friday that he was open to potentially starting the trial earlier than November, as Weinstein's lawyers have requested. Prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office have said that they plan to file ""additional violent sexual assault"" charges after other women agreed to testify against Weinstein. The newest accusers have yet to be publicly identified. Weinstein, 72, attended the court hearing on Friday. He is being held in New York City's notorious Rikers Island jail pending trial. In 2020, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison. But in April, a court of appeals ruled that he did not receive a fair trial because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations about Weinstein for which he was never charged. He was also found guilty of rape at a separate trial in California and was sentenced to 16 years in that case. Weinstein used a wheelchair to attend proceedings at the Manhattan court. He wore a dark suit, blue tie, and thick-framed eyeglasses and was seen carrying a brown folder.  The hearing was delayed for over an hour due to a global software outage affecting Microsoft computers.  Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by over 100 women. The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men. Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction. His films received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 statuettes.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crge2n09x9jo,"Max Matza,",2024-07-19 20:10:21,
541,UN top court says Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal,"The UN's top court has said Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is against international law, in a landmark opinion. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel should stop settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and end its ""illegal"" occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a ""decision of lies"". The court's advisory opinion is not legally binding but still carries significant political weight. It marks the first time the ICJ has delivered a position on the legality of the 57-year occupation. The ICJ, based at The Hague in the Netherlands, has been examining the issue since the beginning of last year, at the request of the UN General Assembly. The court was specifically asked to give its view on Israel's policies and practices towards the Palestinians, and on the legal status of the occupation. Delivering the court's findings, ICJ President Nawaf Salam said it had found that  ""Israel's... continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal."" ""The State of Israel is under the obligation to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible,"" he said. He said Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 did not bring Israel's occupation of that area to an end because it still exercises effective control over it. The court also said Israel should evacuate all of its settlers from the West Bank and East Jerusalem and pay reparations to Palestinians for damages caused by the occupation. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court said the settlements were illegal. Israel has consistently disputed that they are against international law. The ICJ said Israel's ""policies and practices amount to annexation of large parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory"", which it said was against international law, adding that Israel was ""not entitled to sovereignty"" over any part of the occupied territories. Israel claims sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, the eastern half of which it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers the city its indivisible capital - something which is not accepted by the vast majority of the international community. Among its other far-reaching conclusions, the court said Israeli restrictions on Palestinians in the occupied territories constituted ""systemic discrimination based on, inter alia, race, religion or ethnic origin"". It also said Israel had illegally exploited the Palestinians' natural resources and violated their right to self-determination. The court also advised states to avoid any actions, including providing aid or assistance, that would maintain the current situation. Israel's prime minister swiftly issued a blunt statement rejecting what the court had determined. ""The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria"" (the West Bank), Mr Netanyahu said in a statement. ""No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed."" But the court's findings were welcomed by the Palestinians. Hussein Al Sheikh, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinians' main umbrella group, called it ""a historic victory for the rights of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination. And the collapse and defeat of the Judaization project through confiscation, settlement, displacement, and racist practices against a people under occupation. ""The international community must respect the opinion of international justice and force Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories,"" he said. The court's findings will now go to the UN General Assembly, which will decide how to respond, including the option of adopting a resolution. That would be significant and could constitute a catalyst for negotiations and set the legal parameters for a future negotiated settlement. This case is separate from another active case brought to the ICJ by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in the war in Gaza.

540,Donald Trump’s supporters saw two sides of him. Which one might govern?,"Donald Trump took the stage on Thursday night at the Republican National Convention like a conquering hero. He had cheated death. His Democratic opponents were tearing themselves apart. His loyalists, who now fill the ranks of his party, packed the Milwaukee arena and cheered enthusiastically throughout his hour-and-a-half speech. He pledged to serve all Americans if elected then recounted, in a subdued, but almost messianic tone, his brush with a spray of bullets. Some delegates even wore bandages over their right ears like their injured political idol in tribute to him. ""I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,” he said. “Over the last few days, many people have said it was a providential moment.” He spoke of dropping to the ground as bullets flew past him and how his supporters had “great sorrow on their faces”. “When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead,” he said. The unity message and its powerful delivery made for a unique convention speech and a remarkable Trump one. But the rest of his speech was more traditional convention fare. Although he called for ending the “partisan witch hunts” against him, he avoided the extended forays into 2020 election denial that have at times dominated his rally speeches, and he mostly replaced his normal pointed attacks on individual opponents with calls for unity. There was classic Trump in there too - dark and false claims, sometimes during extended improvisations. Trump’s performance hinted that for all the talk of a changed man after the attempt on his life and for all the more organised, focused operation behind him, the former president is still inclined to veer off-script, even in the most momentous of occasions. The question many Americans could be wondering now is which version of Trump will lead the country should he beat Democrat Joe Biden in November. Looking back at the last four days offers some clues. The address, weakly delivered though it may have been, still represented the culmination of a remarkable stretch for the former president, starting with President Joe Biden’s disastrous presidential debate performance in Atlanta three weeks ago that prompted an uprising in his Democratic Party. Since then, the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump had broad immunity from criminal prosecution, a judge delayed sentencing for his New York conviction in a hush-money case and another judge entirely dismissed the case against him for mishandling national security documents. Then he was nearly assassinated. The attempt on his life by a 20-year-old gunman left Trump’s face bloodied and provided the iconic image that was emblazoned on T-shirts and signs at the convention. All of this meant he and his supporters converged on Milwaukee with a sense that their time had come. For four slickly produced and relentlessly on-message evenings, the Republican party positioned itself as a welcoming place for all Americans and the former president as a uniting force who would return the nation to greatness. While there were still partisan speakers throwing red meat to the crowd, they were largely limited to the early-evening slots, when fewer Americans were tuned in to the proceedings. As the final hour each night arrived, the focus softened and a string of speakers described the former president in deeply personal terms. It began on Monday, with Trump receiving an exuberant welcome as he entered the convention centre for his first public appearance since the shooting. He sat in the VIP section of the building and watched as model and social media influencer Amber Rose defended him against accusations of racism: “Donald Trump and his supporters don't care if you're black, white, gay or straight.” On Tuesday, former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recounted Trump hugging her young son at the White House while Lara Trump painted her father-in-law as “an amazing grandfather”. Earlier that evening, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who had been one of Trump’s fiercest critics on the 2024 Republican primary campaign trail, was urging voters who didn’t support Trump “100% of the time” to back his re-election. “When times are really tough, when he’s got everything to lose and nothing to gain,” Steve Witkoff, a friend of the former president, told the audience, “Donald Trump shows up, and he’s there for you.” Trump’s first term in office was marked by sharp political divisions within American society. The day after he was inaugurated, millions marched through the streets of Washington in protest. His attempts to ban nationals from a list of Muslim-majority countries caused chaos at American airports early in his presidency and border restrictions implemented later led to an outcry about crying children separated from their parents at detention centres. Trump’s four years in office ended with him refusing to accept his defeat in the presidential election – denialism that culminated in the 6 January riot at the US Capitol, where thousands of his supporters attempted to block certification of President Biden’s victories. He was denounced by many in his own party, and faced a second impeachment by the House of Representatives. Although he was acquitted in a Senate trial, seven Republicans broke ranks and voted for his conviction. After leaving office, the former president was indicted four times, found culpable for sexual assault by a civil court and convicted of fraud. That was then, however, and here in Wisconsin – within the security bubble of the Republican National Convention – it was decidedly different now. The overriding message from the Republicans this week was that those divisions and distractions are things of the past, and that the Trump that America sees today is not the one they might remember from his first White House tenure.  If the rest of the nation agrees, it would represent a remarkable comeback story or a collective act of political amnesia, depending on one’s perspective. “I think that we really now are the party of unity and inclusiveness,” said Jennifer McGrath, a delegate from Las Vegas, Nevada. “We really are the place to be at this point.” David Botkins, a member of the Virginian Republican Party’s State Central Committee, said he thought the assassination attempt had changed Trump and that he would be “different, better and more effective” in a second presidential term. “I think the policies are going to be the same, the conservatism is going to be the same, but there may be a tenderness and a compassion and a gratitude and a respect for divine providence that will inform the tone with which he conducts himself as president for the next four years.” As for those policies and proposals, the Republican convention offered scant details. The first three nights of the convention each had a theme – the economy, safety and foreign policy. They formed a framework for the former president’s acceptance speech and offer a useful guide for the key points the party is seeking to emphasise in the campaign ahead. While Trump only mentioned President Biden by name once, he noted that “this administration” was presiding over soaring inflation (which has now eased), knowing that economic concerns are the bread-and-butter of bids to oust an incumbent officeholder. Crime and immigration, two issues on which Republicans joined at the hip all week, served as the centrepiece on “safety” night. Polls show that a majority of Americans now favour lowering immigration levels and support Trump’s call for removing millions of undocumented migrants residing in the US. During Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s speech, some convention attendees waved pre-printed signs reading “mass deportation now”. Conflicts abroad were another prong of the Republican case against Mr Biden. In a particularly dramatic moment on Wednesday, families of six of the 13 US soldiers killed by a car bomb during the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan took the stage to blame the current president for the deaths and claim that the president wasn’t fit to lead the nation’s military. “With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over,” Trump said in his speech. And while there were more specific policy discussions in events held on the sidelines of the convention, they took place well away from prime-time network television cameras. For instance, on Monday, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, hosted a “policy fest”, where former Trump administration officials and Republican politicians offered their views on topics like foreign policy, education, immigration, the economy and energy. The Heritage Foundation is behind the 1,000-page Project 2025 blueprint for a second Trump presidency, which has generated controversy, media attention and relentless attacks from Democrats – and many of the speakers defended their efforts to provide a detailed plan for a new Republican administration. On Thursday, Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita made it clear what he thought of these outside efforts, describing Project 2025 - which many officials from the first Trump administration are part of - as a “pain in the ass”. ""The issues that are going to win us this campaign are not the issues that they want to talk about,"" he said. Eight years ago, when Donald Trump first ran for president, the Republican National Convention in Cleveland was a sometimes chaotic event, with then-establishment conservatives making last-ditch efforts to deny him the nomination. Trump’s 2024 campaign is run by wily operatives, rather than political fringe characters, and they kept the convention participants on a tight script this week. The party, from the top to the grass-roots, has been fully remade in the former president’s image. In 2016, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who finished second behind Trump in the primary voting, pointedly declined to endorse the winner, saying only that Republicans should vote their “conscience”. He was roundly booed. This time around, he started his speech by saying “God bless Donald Trump” and went on to lavish the former president with praise. Trump’s other Republican critics were nowhere to be found. His former vice-president, Mike Pence, spent the week on holiday in Montana. Senators like Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine stayed home. Former President George W Bush also kept his distance. On Wednesday, it was Trump’s new vice-presidential running mate, JD Vance, who laid out the core tenets of this new, Trump-dominated Republican Party in his nomination acceptance speech. “We won’t cater to Wall Street, we’ll commit to the working man,” he said. “We won’t import foreign labour, we’ll fight for American citizens. We won’t buy energy from countries that hate us, we’ll get it right here from American workers. We won’t sacrifice our supply chains to unlimited global trade, we’ll stamp every product ‘Made in the USA.’” The political festivities in Milwaukee were Trumpism from start to finish - a carefully calibrated machine, promoting the party’s most popular agenda items and focusing criticism on one man, President Joe Biden. But what if Republicans are going after the wrong guy? A growing number of Democrats have called on Mr Biden to be replaced as their presidential nominee and speculation is growing that he might actually listen. The Democratic convention isn’t until the end of August, leaving time for the president to step aside either for his running mate, Kamala Harris, or for an open process to select another candidate. On Thursday evening, the Trump campaign sought to highlight their candidate’s strength and vitality by giving him a raucous entrance, preceded by appearances by former wrestler Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Fighting Championship impresario Dana White and a performance by Kid Rock. The campaign’s intention - to draw a contrast with Mr Biden’s perceived frailty and target younger male voters - was obvious. That strategy may be less effective against Ms Harris or one of the more youthful Democratic governors who are mentioned as possible Biden successors. But for the moment, the Republicans are riding high and optimistic about their victory in November, convinced that the former president’s run of good fortune is just getting started.

539,Who is Kamala Harris? The VP's star is rising among Democrats,"Less than four months out from the election, Vice-President Kamala Harris has found herself in a difficult position.  President Joe Biden's poor performance on the debate stage spurred mounting criticism about his ability to win the election. As anxiety has turned to tension within the Democratic party, one name has risen to the top of the list of possible replacement candidates: hers. Four years ago, the one-time candidate for the Democratic nomination would have welcomed the party's praises. But now she receives it from a different and perhaps more precarious position as part of an embattled incumbent ticket. How strongly should she go to bat for her running mate, knowing her chances of another term hang in the balance?  In the 24 hours after the debate debacle, Ms Harris chose strong loyalty to Mr Biden. The vice-president spoke on CNN, MSNBC and at a campaign rally. She defended her political partner's record and attacked their opponent, former President Donald Trump.  “We believe in our president, Joe Biden, and we believe in what he stands for,” she said at the rally. Yet conversation continues to ebb and flow among Democrats about Mr Biden's chances, with high ranking members expressing varying levels of support for Mr Biden - and some even changing their minds - in a party-wide reckoning that has played out in media reports and private meetings.  Ms Harris hasn't wavered, but support has grown stronger for her as the party's path forward. Even Republicans have begun to incoporate her name into the Trump campaign's messaging. After making history as the first woman as well as the first black and Asian American vice president, supporters argue her current title as second-in-command could mark a more seamless transition if Biden passes the baton.  Despite having low approval ratings during her tenure as vice president, Ms Harris' supporters point to her advocacy for reproductive rights, appeal among black voters and her background as a prosecutor who would be running against a now-convicted felon to make the case for her serving as commander-in-chief:  ""I believe she has been instrumental in addressing key issues such as voting rights and immigration reform,""  Nadia Brown, director of Georgetown University's Women's and Gender Studies Program, said. ""She has also been Biden's most powerful surrogate on issues of abortion access and outreach to Black communities.""  Just five years ago, Ms Harris was the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency.  She began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. But her presidential aims were unsuccessful in 2020. Her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Her campaign died in less than a year and it was Mr Biden who returned the now 59-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 who critiqued her run for the presidential nomination, called it “a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris”. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent,” Duran said.  Ms Harris focused on several key initiatives while in the White House and she was instrumental in some of the Biden administration's most touted accomplishments. She launched a nationwide “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour advocating for women to have the right to make decisions about their body. She highlighted harm caused by abortion bans and called on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v Wade after the Supreme Court's conservative justices overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Ms Harris set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president in the history of the Senate. Her vote helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which provided COVID relief funding including stimulus payments.  Her tie-breaking vote also confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown Jakson to the Supreme Court. But she also struggled to achieve broad appeal among Americans, facing criticism on all sides.  Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not being progressive enough for some Democratic voters. ""Kamala is a cop"" was a common refrain on the 2020 campaign trail.  Mr Biden also called upon Ms Harris to lead efforts addressing the root causes of migration as a record number of immigrants fled to the US-Mexico border, an issue opponents point to as one where she hasn't made enough progress.  She received backlash from Republicans and some Democrats for taking six months to plan a trip to the border after entering office. But in recent weeks, as speculation about Mr Biden's ability to win in November swirled, she found a renewed base of support.  Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation,"" she said. They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa' and the Martin Luther King holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson said. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explained - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". She told the Washington Post in 2019 that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. From the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness,"" she said. Wit and humour is part of that armoury. In a video posted to her social media in 2020 after winning the election, she shares the news of the win - with a very hearty laugh - with Mr Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" The laugh she greeted the then president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate - to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 2014, then-Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff and became stepmother to his two children. She wrote an article for Elle magazine in 2019 about the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. Many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House.

537,"Crime, immigration and tax cuts - Trump's speech fact-checked","Donald Trump has addressed the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, accepting the nomination as the party’s presidential candidate. His speech - which lasted one and a half hours - contained plenty of claims about his record as president versus Joe Biden's.  BBC Verify has been checking some of them.  CLAIM: “Our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down"" VERDICT: Violent crime in the US fell last year. Mr Trump did not specify what kind of crime he was talking about.  Violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and there was a significant drop of 13% in the murder rate, according to preliminary FBI data.  These statistics aren’t a complete picture as some local police departments have not yet submitted their figures. The official FBI figures for last year will be released in October.  The latest FBI crime data, which is also preliminary, indicates this downward trend in violent crime in the US has continued into 2024, with reported incidents falling 15% in the first three months of this year, compared with the same period last year. Recorded murders dropped by more than 26% in the same time period, according to the figures.  CLAIM: ""We've had the worst inflation we've ever had under this person [Biden]""  VERDICT:  Under President Biden, inflation reached around 9% before falling to around 3%. That's nowhere near the worst in history - the record was 23.7% in 1920. Inflation rose significantly during the first two years of the Biden administration, hitting a peak of 9.1% in the year to June 2022. This was comparable with many other Western countries, which experienced high inflation rates in 2021 and 2022, as global supply chain issues as a consequence of Covid and the war in Ukraine contributed to rising prices.  But some economists say Mr Biden’s $1.9tn (£1.5tn) spending plan in 2021 was a factor as well. Since then, US inflation has fallen steadily with the latest monthly figure at 3% as of June. Mr Trump also said “we had no inflation” under his administration. When Mr Biden came to office in January 2021, inflation was low -  at 1.4% - but prices were still rising.  CLAIM: “Our opponents inherited a world at peace""  VERDICT: There were dozens of conflicts globally in the last year Mr Trump was president, according to experts. Mr Trump followed this claim by saying the world was now a ""planet at war"" and he highlighted the current conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.  He’s right that they didn’t happen on his watch but he’s wrong to claim that he left “a world at peace” to President Biden. In 2020, the last full year Mr Trump was President, there were 56 active conflicts around the world, according to the Peace Research Institute in Oslo. It classed eight of these as wars, including ones in Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen. CLAIM: ""If somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car or a hybrid they are going to be able to do it, and we’re going to make that change on day one""  VERDICT: The implication here is that Americans cannot buy these cars or will not be able to. There is no current ban on vehicles which run on gas (petrol) in the US and Mr Biden has not set out a plan to introduce one in the future. In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new emission standards for cars built between 2027 and 2032. It estimates the car industry could meet these standards if 56% of new vehicles are electric by 2032. The Biden administration has said this is not a ban and new petrol-powered vehicles can still be sold beyond 2032. CLAIM: “The jobs that are created [under Biden] - 107% of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens” VERDICT: We can't find any evidence for this figure and the data shows millions of new jobs have gone to US-born workers.  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics produces figures for both US-born and foreign-born workers. But it does not have a separate category for illegal immigrants and Mr Trump did not say where he got his figure from.  Since President Biden took office in January 2021, the number of US-born workers has increased by 7.8 million. Over the same period, the number of foreign-born workers in the US rose by 5.5 million.  CLAIM: “The biggest tax cuts ever""  VERDICT: As President, Donald Trump did bring in big tax cuts but they weren’t the largest in history.  Mr Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 brought in sweeping cuts to taxation across the board. These are due to expire in 2025 unless the next administration extends them. According to analysis done by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s tax cuts were the eighth-largest since 1918 measured as a percentage of the size of the economy (GDP), and the fourth-largest in dollar terms since 1940 adjusted for inflation. Although, Mr Trump didn't introduce the largest tax cut overall he did pass the largest corporate tax cut in US history.  The 2017 law reduced this tax rate from 35% to 21%.  That was more than the cut passed under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, which lowered the rate from 46% to 34%.

536,How a single IT update caused global havoc,"A single update pushed out from an anti-virus company in the US has managed to cause global havoc today. It’s being described as the biggest outage ever, and while there have been a few lately, it’s certainly hard to recall something that has taken out as many services and companies across the world as this one has. I stopped updating my list of brands reporting issues within an hour of starting it because there were simply so many names to keep track of. You may never have heard of the anti-virus firm Crowdstrike before but something it did to its virus scanner Falcon had a very adverse effect on computers running Windows software – in their millions.  Blue Screen of Death reported worldwide. You probably don’t need me to tell you what that is. Microsoft was quick to say it was a “third-party issue” – in other words, not its fault. Apple and Linux users, unaffected, rejoiced. Crowdstrike says it has now issued a fix but several IT contacts have told me every single machine in their organisations will require a manual reboot in safe mode, and some of these devices are likely to be more physically accessible than others. There is currently no suggestion that it was malicious, or that anybody’s data has been compromised, accessed or stolen. The cyber-security world still advises that it’s a good idea to keep on top of software updates – although perhaps today is not the day to bang that particular drum. Crowdstrike’s statement, when it arrived, stopped short of an apology, which infuriated people online. However, shortly after the statement was released, CEO George Kurtz told US broadcaster NBC News: ""We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our companies."" It is a poignant reminder of how reliant the world has become on devices managed remotely by huge companies, and how powerless it leaves us when they fail.  These enormous platforms are bombarded all the time with attempted cyber-attacks, and ill-thought out software updates, and most of them are caught by the tech giants’ robust systems. There will no doubt be a post-mortem at Microsoft as to why this one was not. Timing is also everything. “Never push an update on a Friday,” sighed one computer scientist I spoke to, head in hands. That's because if something goes wrong and it takes time to fix, firms typically have fewer people working at weekends so it will inevitably take even longer to resolve. For that reason, many big firms do tend to prefer updates during the middle of the week. If you are a Crowdstrike customer, there are details on its support website explaining the fix. If you work for a company with an IT team, they may well be co-ordinating a company-wide response. Often by the time you’ve noticed an outage, it has fixed itself. This is certainly not the case here. It is likely to be a few days at least before the world returns to normal.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwdyxx0v64o,"Zoe Kleinman,",2024-07-19 12:10:21,
535,Republicans put abortion disagreements aside at 'unity' convention,"Edna Wales, a Republican delegate from Florida, does not support abortion. As a Roman Catholic, the procedure goes against her moral values. But her policy position, she told the BBC at a street fair at the Republican National Convention, was that it should be left to the states. “I truly feel that,” she said. Given that outlawing abortion nationwide has been an animating issue for religious Republicans for decades, it was a surprising position to hear at this weeklong gathering.  Yet Ms Wales’ stance is the same one that Donald Trump, the party’s nominee for president, now espouses. The former president has boasted of appointing a US Supreme Court bench that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. The 2022 decision upended the landscape of abortion access in the US, with some Republican-led states swiftly outlawing or restricting the procedure while other Democratic-controlled states took steps to protect access. After months of back and forth, Trump has made something of a public retreat from the issue, saying abortion should now be left to the states. While the party appears in lockstep with their nominee - a key theme of this week’s convention has been “unity” – under the surface, some daylight has emerged between Trump’s Republican Party and the most ardent members of the anti-abortion movement who want to see the procedure ended nationally. “I think where, potentially, President Trump currently is, and the pro-life movement is, it could be a schism,” said Marc Short, who was chief-of-staff to former vice-president Mike Pence – one of the party’s staunchest anti-abortion politicians. Trump’s position may well be a political calculation, given polls suggest the majority of Americans support abortion access. The end of Roe v Wade has also given Democrats a potent political issue to campaign on: protecting access. They performed better than expected during the 2022 midterm elections, and many pollsters and pundits credited the abortion issue for this. Trump’s supporters at the convention in Milwaukee told the BBC they appreciated the pragmatism at play. “I understand how he has to be so careful of how he handles [abortion] because of his run for president,” Ms Wales said. She said she believed pressure from the right on Trump was unfair, because “a lot of people are against abortion. You know, a lot of people are for abortion, and that is a very touchy subject”. Internal tensions over the issue spilled into the open with the release of the 2024 Republican Party platform, which outlines its policies and positions on various key issues. Its abortion section in 2016, and again in 2020, promised to appoint anti-abortion judges, to axe federal funding for Planned Parenthood and called for a “human life amendment” to be added to the Constitution. This year, the abortion section underwent a heavy edit. It cut the abortion section from 775 words to 90. The four-sentence pledge promises to stand for life and oppose “late-term abortion”. It also states the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution “guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights”. It then adds: “Because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.” Republicans in Milwaukee expressed little issue with the new language and fell in line behind their nominee. “I agree it has to be up to the states,” said Maria Rodriguez of Georgia, who described herself as a “pro-life Christian” who switched to the Republican Party due to its opposition to abortion. “I just don't feel like it's something that should be done nationally,” said Jackie Canon, a delegate from Louisiana. “I feel like it should be done state by state.” But the changes also inspired some anger. Mr Short told the BBC religious conservatives were “disappointed” by the platform position on abortion, and some had viewed the end of Roe v Wade as a “first step”. His former boss, Mike Pence, was one of them, calling the platform a “profound disappointment” that removed “historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform”. “They rolled us,” Gail Ruzicka, who was on the RNC platform committee, told WISN Milwaukee. “I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language.” At a glance, the 2024 abortion platform seemed to reflect Trump's new, more moderate stance that puts the onus on the states. Those paying close attention saw something different. “This particular platform is not going to win any prizes for eloquence,” said Kristi Hamrick, vice-president of policy for Students for Life, one of the largest anti-abortion organisations in the country. But, she said, the platform gave us “what we asked for”. “The 14th Amendment is the legal foundation upon which we need to build a new, more pro-life America,” she said. “That’s a win.” The 14th Amendment has, for years, been raised by anti-abortion activists to claim that foetuses should be granted the same rights as other Americans. In this thinking, a federal abortion ban already exists within the constitution, and no new amendment or law is needed. “Invoking the 14th Amendment to protect ‘every life’ is clearly a call to foetal personhood,” Rachel Rebouché, dean and law professor at Temple University Law school, and a leading scholar in reproductive health law. “That’s got to be the end game.” In other words, what looked like a softening of language on abortion could in fact be read as a possible pathway to outlawing it nationwide. Most national leaders in the anti-abortion movement joined Ms Hamrick in applauding the platform. Marjorie Dannenfelser of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, John Mize of Americans United for Life and Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition all signed a letter pledging their support for the platform. Experts say any confusion was likely intentional, a marker of a party juggling a socially conservative base, while also working to appeal to moderate voters who largely support abortion access. “In reality there are these two mutually incompatible constituencies that the GOP is trying to appeal to on abortion,” said Mary Ziegler, a historian and law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a leading expert on the abortion debate. “I think the platform was designed to placate all these people… and you can’t really do that by being clear,” she said. “I think confusion is the best strategy that’s emerged.” Even sceptical Republicans here in Milwaukee are falling in line behind Trump on abortion, a sign of the grip he holds on the Republican Party. Former US Senator Rick Santorum, a prominent anti-abortion politician, told the BBC on the convention floor that he was “obviously disappointed” in the new party platform “but Donald Trump is a strong pro-life president”. He anticipated there may be more arguments over abortion in the party in the years to come, but with Trump about to be crowned the nominee, he said now was not the time. “I’m not sure it’s much of a battle right now,” he said.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3nz67v9lo,"Kayla Epstein and Holly Honderich,",2024-07-19 03:10:21,
534,Who are the Democrats calling time on Joe Biden?,"Joe Biden's campaign has been thrust into a pressure cooker of doubt, as panic and worry about his election chances pour in from the highest levels of the Democratic party.  In recent days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns in private to Mr Biden about his candidacy. Even his former running mate, former President Barack Obama, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished. A 6 July letter from high-ranking congressman Jamie Raskin was made public on Thursday, where the Maryland representative compared the president to a baseball pitcher whose arm has ""tired out"".  Mr Biden, 81, has repeatedly and defiantly declared he is ""not going anywhere"", urging his party to refocus on the task of defeating Donald Trump. But the calls to exit are nearing a crescendo as Democratic politicians, donors and voters speak out against the president's candidacy. Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol are coming out in growing numbers against the idea of Mr Biden staying in the race. It began five days after the June 27 debate with Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, who said that it was time for Mr Biden to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"". Mr Doggett, 77, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said he respected ""all that President Biden has achieved"" but that the Democrat had failed to ""effectively defend his many accomplishments"" on the debate stage. Only three members of the Senate have so far publicly called for Mr Biden to drop out. They are Peter Welch of Vermont, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Montana's Jon Tester, who is fighting for re-election. They have been joined by House colleagues including the likes of Adam Schiff, California's likely next senator, and several members in tight re-election races of their own. The others are: Other prominent figures have also joined the growing chorus: Senior Democrats, including party leaders in Washington, have parsed their tongues in public on whether Mr Biden should continue his 2024 bid. Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, had previously declined to directly answer whether she wanted him to keep running. She did so on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the president's favourite news programme.  ""I want him to do whatever he decides to do,"" she said, adding that ""time is running short"" for him to make that call. CNN reported that since then, Mrs Pelosi had met with Mr Biden privately and told him that polls show he cannot win in November. She later slammed the reporting as a ""feeding frenzy"", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place. Her replacement as House Democratic chief, Hakeem Jeffries, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have reportedly also met Mr Biden to privately express both their concerns about his ability to win re-election and the potential impact of his candidacy on Democratic hopes of controlling the House and Senate. Many politicians have declined to outright call for Mr Biden's removal, while expressing respect for his record and raising concerns over his campaign's poor standing. Patty Murray, of Washington state, said Mr Biden ""must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump"". Michael Bennet, of Colorado, warned that Mr Trump was on track to win ""by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House"". Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey has also publicly aired her doubts since the debate. But the president is not without his backers. Vice-President Kamala Harris has not wavered in standing by her boss, as have potential replacement candidates such as Gavin Newsom, California's governor, and his Michigan and Maryland contemporaries Gretchen Whitmer and Wes Moore. Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has continued to defend Mr Biden, telling MSNBC ""we've got to stop the nitpicking"". The powerful Congressional Black Caucus, which represents about one quarter of House Democrats, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have recently reaffirmed their backing for Mr Biden.  More than 1,400 black women backing the Biden-Harris ticket, including former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, wrote an open letter to reiterate their support. Also standing by Mr Biden, and enthusiastically so, are outspoken figures on the Hill such as two-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota firebrand Ilhan Omar, and John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania senator.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngd0dve6lo,"Sam Cabral and Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-19 17:10:21,
533,UK to resume funding to UN Gaza aid agency,"The UK will resume funding UNRWA, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, the foreign secretary has announced. David Lammy told MPs he had received reassurances about its neutrality in the wake of a review of alleged links between its staff and terror groups. The UK was among 16 Western countries to halt donations in January, after Israel alleged 12 UNRWA staff were involved in the October 2023 attacks by Hamas. An internal UN investigation into allegations related to that attack is ongoing. But a separate UN review, published in April, found Israel had not provided evidence for its claims hundreds of UNRWA staff were members of terror groups. The announcement brings the UK into line with other countries that have resumed funding since then, leaving the United States, UNRWA's single biggest donor, as the only country not to have restarted donations. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Lammy said ""no other agency"" was able to deliver aid at the scale required to alleviate the “desperate"" humanitarian situation in Gaza. He added UNRWA was feeding more than half the territory's two-million population and would be ""vital for future reconstruction"". He said he had been ""appalled"" by Israel's allegations, but the claims had been taken ""seriously” by the United Nations. He had been reassured the agency ""is ensuring they meet the highest standards of neutrality"" in the wake of the April review, he added. This included ""strengthening its procedures, including on vetting,"" Mr Lammy said.  He told MPs a resumption of the UK's £21m annual funding would include money put towards “management reforms” recommended by the UN review. The Foreign Office said £6m would be given to UNRWA's flash appeal for Gaza, and £15m to the agency's budget to provide services in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and wider region. UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma told the BBC the agency welcomed the announcement, which came at a ""critical time as humanitarian needs in Gaza continue to deepen"". She added that the agency had reassured the UK it was implementing recommendations from the April report, ""especially with regards to continuing to follow the principle of neutrality in our programmes"". The review, by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, found Israel had ""yet to provide supporting evidence"" for its claims that a ""significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations"". Israel has said more than 2,135 employees of the agency - out of a total of 13,000 in Gaza - are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.  However, the review concluded the agency must do more to improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency. Israeli authorities suggest the report ignores the severity of the problem, and claim UNRWA has systematic links with Hamas. Israel initially alleged that 12 UNRWA staff took part in the Hamas attacks on southern Israel, which saw 1,200 people killed and about 250 taken hostage. More than 38,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry, after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the attacks.  UNRWA sacked the 10 of the 12 employees who were still alive when the allegations emerged and the UN's Office of Internal Oversight launched an investigation into the claims. In April, the body said eight employees remained under investigation, with inquiries suspended in four of the cases because of insufficient evidence. It added it had also begun investigations into an additional seven staff members, and six of those cases were ongoing.   During his Commons statement, Mr Lammy also rejected calls from some Labour  MPs to impose a ban on all UK weapons sales to Israel. Alongside Green MPs and pro-Gaza independents, some 14 Labour backbenchers want to table an amendment calling for an arms embargo during a debate next week on the King's Speech, the government's law-making plans. The foreign secretary said it would ""not be right to have a blanket ban"" as Israel was surrounded by enemies in ""one of the toughest neighbourhoods in the world"". He added that arms export licences would be kept under review ""in the normal way"" by reviewing assessments of Israel's compliance by government lawyers. A ""comprehensive review"" was under way and he would update MPs once it was complete, Mr Lammy said.  However, he did not commit to publishing internal legal advice - something he called on the previous government to do when Labour was in opposition.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjm9r0w71g8o,Unknown,2024-07-19 15:10:21,

538,A rare event - Melania Trump attends husband's speech,"Donald Trump’s elusive wife Melania has appeared in public for the first time since the former president narrowly missed an assassin’s bullet. Wearing Republican red she walked, alone, into the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee accompanied by classical music - a marked contrast from the country music anthems and rock ballads we’ve been hearing all week. Glossy and glamorous, she looked more like she was walking down a catwalk than into a political convention. She seemed as inscrutable and distant as ever. She joined him on stage after his lengthy acceptance speech, walking to the podium just before balloons rained down on thousands in the crowd. Donald Trump greeted her with a hug and the pair shared a kiss on the cheek.  He then grabbed her hand and walked across the stage as other members of the Trump family joined them.  Ever since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics. In the White House during Trump’s first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests. The US national archives descibes her as having been an “ambassador for kindness” and an advocate for children’s issues. And since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband’s side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present. She wasn’t there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn’t there when he officially won his party’s presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday. “Melania does what Melania wants,” said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. “She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it. She doesn’t feel any obligation to do it.” We are now all accustomed to the fact that she doesn’t turn up at many of Donald Trump’s events, but on Monday, when he walked into the arena here in Milwaukee to a roaring welcome, greeted like a Messiah after his survival of the assassination attempt, her absence felt particularly obvious. It was certainly noticed by the Republicans gathered here, but that didn’t mean they weren’t excited for her appearance, when it finally came. Melania is the most enigmatic first lady in modern history and we rarely hear what she thinks. An exception was the lengthy statement she released after the shooting targeting her husband, which read as though she may have dictated it directly. “A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald’s passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,” she said. “The core facets of my husband’s life – his human side – were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.” It is traditional at party conventions for the candidate’s spouse to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life. On Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump’s newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. She called her husband a “meat and potatoes” man, but - in an apparent sign of his devotion - said he now cooked her Indian vegetarian food. And while Donald Trump’s oldest son Don Jr, middle son Eric, daughter-in-law Lara and granddaughter Kai have all spoken at this convention, Melania has declined the opportunity to speak. She very clearly does not do anything she does not want to do. When she did introduce her husband at the 2016 convention when he first ran for president - things went horribly wrong. She was criticised for plagiarising the speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008 when she introduced her husband Barack at the Democratic convention. Melania's speechwriter later accepted the blame. First ladies are always heavily scrutinised for the image they project, the causes they adopt, and the clothes they wear. But Melania Trump is the first who was previously a professional model. She looks fabulous in photographs and is well aware of the power of her image. By offering so few photo opportunities, she makes each one infinitely more powerful. “She is very savvy and has cultivated the mystery woman mystique by going underground and then when she does come out, it’s a much bigger deal,” says Ms Jordan. “She doesn’t appear very often, but she does show up when Donald Trump really needs her.” After Saturday’s attempt on his life, Melania felt MIA. But on Thursday night, as she slowly walked the stairs to the VIP section, paused at the top and waved to all corners of the arena, she showed her mastery of the power of an image. Her absence may, at times, be her strength.",2024-07-19 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk4k1pxxwo,"Sarah Smith,",2024-07-19 06:10:21,
553,Ghosts of Olympics past leave their mark in Paris,"“If Greece is the cradle of the Olympics, Paris represents its home.” So begins a somewhat partisan account of the city’s long association with the Games, published ahead of its failed bid (to London) for 2012. Paris, wrote the author hopefully, is where the Olympic movement “rediscovered its vigour after an interminable historical amnesia,” and where there took place “so many important steps in its modern-day growth.” Step one was the founding congress of the International Olympic Committee, chaired by the French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin at Sorbonne university in June 1894. And then came steps two and three: the second and eighth Olympic Games, both organised in the French capital. Today there are still traces of both those Games. Here and there, if you look, their “legacy” is still very much alive. Exhibit one is the magnificent vélodrome in the Bois de Vincennes known as the Cipale (short for Municipale), which continues in use 124 years after the first Paris Games. Cycling was one of the most popular sports back in 1900, but the Cipale was also used for gymnastics, football, rugby … and cricket. It was on this hallowed turf that the (until now) only ever Olympic cricket match took place – between England and France. England won – but that still means France is the title holder of the Olympic silver.  That will presumably end in 2028 when cricket returns for Los Angeles – but who knows?! There have been renovations at La Cipale over the years but apart from the roof, the viewing stand is unchanged. So is the concrete track with its raised curves at either end, and there - forgotten behind the bushes in the corner - the original urinals, the relief of generations of hard-pressed cycling fans! The 1900 Games were strange ones, and are only just accepted today as part of the Olympic canon. Talking of cannons, one of the unusual events was artillery firing. There were also boules, fishing, crossbow-firing, barrel-rolling and long-distance ballooning.  The winner of that one landed near Kyiv. The difficulty was that the Games took place at exactly the same time as the Paris World Fair, and many people – including competitors - thought the sports were part of the World Fair. But they served an important purpose in establishing – after the first Greek edition in 1896 – that the Games were to be international, and not forever Hellene. And they helped advance the growing idea that sports were something to be taken seriously, and not just a frivolous pastime. The work of the French scientist Etienne Jules Marey was significant in this regard.  Famous for his photographic studies of sportsmen in action,  he persuaded many 1900 athletes to perform at his outdoor studio (under what is now Court 1 at Roland-Garros). Less brilliantly, he also sent round an anthropological questionnaire to Olympic participants seeking elucidation on such vital points as: the colour of their beards; the physical strength of their grandfathers; and whether they’d been fed as babies on breast or bottle. The 1900 Games were the first to see the participation – in golf, tennis, sailing and croquet - of (a few) women. By 1924, the sports of swimming, diving and fencing had been added, and 135 women took part. The main legacy of the 1924 Games is the Colombes stadium in the north-western Paris suburbs, where the opening ceremony and much of the subsequent sporting action were staged. The stadium – built on a former horse-racing track – went on to have a famed life, becoming for much of the last century France’s pre-eminent football and rugby venue, before being superseded by the Parc des Princes and then the Stade de France. Today it is very much still standing – and will be used in these Olympics as the venue for field hockey events. “For French people who love sport, Colombes is a place full of emotion,” says sports historian Mickael Delepine. “So many famous people have run and kicked and tackled here. It is full of ghosts."" For British sports fans, the ghosts are of sprinters Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell who won the golds here that were later immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire. The film faithfully recreated the stadium at a venue in the Wirral, Merseyside. In Colombes, the track is exactly where it was 100 years ago, overlooked by the same iron stand. The1924 Games were the first to take advantage of advances in communication - and winning athletes for the first time became household names. The Flying Finns Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola dominated middle-and long-distance racing, and long-jumper William de Hart-Hubbard was the first black man to win an event. Colombes also saw victory for the Uruguayan football team - setting up its triumph at the first World Cup on home turf in 1930.  And there was a famously dirty rugby final between the USA and France, whose violence contributed to the game being excluded from future Olympics.  (The USA won). The 1924 Olympics were also the first to display the Olympic motto - Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger); and the first to use a 50-metre swimming pool with lanes painted on the bottom. Among the heroes availing themselves of this innovation was one Johnny Weissmuller – later to find fame as cinema’s Tarzan. It all happened at the purpose-built Tourelles swimming pool in the 20th arrondissement of Paris.  A century on the pool is still there, and in use as a practice venue for today’s Olympic stars.",2024-07-19 23:10:22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cerv1142mmvo,"Hugh Schofield,",2024-07-19 05:10:22,
551,South Africa's calm opening of parliament heralds new era,"South Africa parliament appears to have entered a new era - one of political maturity. The atmosphere was remarkably different from what had gone before - no interruptions, no chaos and no scuffles, as President Cyril Ramaphosa laid out plans for the first time since the coalition government took office. This was a result of the African National Congress (ANC) failing to secure more than 50% of the vote for the first time in the democratic era. Former President Jacob Zuma - who leads the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party but was barred from running as an MP just before May's election - snubbed the invitation to attend Thursday's sitting. With the parliament now open, the MK - a party founded less than a year ago - was recognised as the official opposition. Its leader of house, disgraced former Justice John Hlophe, had promised not to engage in petty politics. Also, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - who have a reputation for disrupting, heckling and brawling in parliament - had promised to change, with party leader Julius Malema saying the EFF would be a constructive opposition. Members of the Democratic Alliance (DA) - formerly South Africa's official opposition but now part of the coalition government - nodded and clapped during an hour-long speech as the ANC's President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the top priorities.  These included rapid, inclusive economic growth, job creation and tackling the high cost of basic goods. Mr Ramaphosa's humbled ANC had streamed into parliament with the least number of members since it came to power 30 years ago.  After losing its parliamentary majority, the ANC formed an initially shaky coalition with nine other political parties. Mr Ramaphosa’s address followed the coalition government's first cabinet meeting since the vote was held. That meeting ""underscored the determination of all members of the Government of National Unity to work together to advance the interests of all South Africans"", he told parliament.  The priorities he has announced fuse mostly ANC policies with some concessions made to accommodate the concerns of the DA, South Africa's second-largest party and the ANC's long-time rival. The pro-free market DA is ideologically at odds with the ANC's social welfare traditions, and seen by many as catering to the interests of the white minority, which it denies. In his address, Mr Ramaphosa firmly stated economic growth must ""support the empowerment of black South Africans and women and those who in the past had been relegated to the fringes of the economy"".  The government, which is backed by 70% of the MPs, promises to make ""massive"" investments in infrastructure and turn the whole country ""into a construction site"". The second area of focus will be to expand the basket of essential food items exempt from the VAT sales tax, in order to address the high cost of living. This is an initiative that the DA had been lobbying for in an effort to eliminate poverty, TK Pooe, a senior researcher at the Wits School of Governance, told the BBC. Another part-concession, the ANC’s plan to launch compulsory universal healthcare for all, will now proceed subject to consultation with stakeholders. The DA and private medical insurance groups had threatened legal action, arguing that the scheme violates the right to choose a service provider. ""Court will be the last resort,"" DA leader and Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen told journalists outside parliament.   ""We are in government now and have a forum in which we can negotiate."" He welcomed Mr Ramaphosa's speech. New sports minister Gayton McKenzie was also pleased, saying the address was Mr Ramaphosa’s ""best"" ever.  However, John Trollip from Action SA, a political party that is not part of the new government, said the president's address was thin on credibility and sounded like lots of previous speeches. The EFF’s Mr Malema told national broadcaster SABC that ""it’s very clear that the president has got no plan to transform South Africa for the better"".  But Mr Pooe said what the president did not explicitly mention – foreign policy and the ANC's ties to Gaza and Russia - is equally important as the priorities he outlined. ""It'll be interesting to see how now the statements about Israel and Russia might become a bit more muted to accommodate the many voices in the room,"" he said, in reference to the DA's support of Israel. The MK's John Hlophe agreed. ""He didn’t address the issue of Palestine because the DA is watching him,"" he said. Mr Hlophe added that the speech was ""appalling"" and silent on land reform without compensation - a central MK policy as well as a key issue nationally. White people, who make up just 7% of the population, own the vast majority of farmland that is held by individuals. There has long been a debate about whether the state should redistribute this land without paying its owners for it. Mr Pooe believed the president's speech did not over-promise. ""We are not expecting to see radical change and that might be a positive. [The speech said] these are the choke points holding the country back: energy, infrastructure local government and this is what is going to be addressed,"" he said. ""If the grand coalition can stick to those things and then allow private actors to come in on the other matters the better for South Africa.""  Perhaps deliberately, the opening of parliament coincided with the birthday of the country's first democratically elected President, Nelson  Mandela, who at the time symbolised hope and renewal for a nation in crisis. Thursday might not have recaptured that hope entirely. But Mr Ramaphosa said the unity government would ""seek to build consensus on issues we don’t agree on"". He acknowledged that they would have to work hard to reach this consensus. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

552,Journalist told to pay damages for mocking Italian PM's height,"An Italian journalist has been ordered to pay Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni damages of €5,000 (£4,210) over social media posts making fun of her height.  A judge ruled that two tweets by Giulia Cortese, who was also handed a suspended fine of €1,200, were defamatory and amounted to ""body shaming"".  It followed an exchange in which Ms Cortese described Ms Meloni as a ""little woman"" and told her: ""I can’t even see you."" Reacting to the verdict, Ms Cortese said the Italian government had a ""serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent"". The pair first clashed in October 2021, when Ms Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy party was still in opposition, after Ms Cortese posted a mocked-up image of Ms Meloni on X, formerly Twitter.  Ms Meloni was seen in the image standing in front of a bookshelf on to which a framed photo of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini had been artificially added.  In a post on Facebook, Ms Meloni said the image was of ""unique gravity"" and that she would be taking legal action.  Later the same day, Mr Cortese said she had deleted the image after realising it was fake, but accused Ms Meloni of creating a ""media pillory"" against her and said the Facebook post showed that she was a ""little woman"".  She later said in a separate post: ""You don't scare me, Giorgia Meloni. After all, you're only 1.2m [3ft 9in] tall. I can't even see you."" Ms Meloni's height is reported in Italian media to be 1.63m (5ft 3in). Ms Cortese was cleared for posting the initial image but convicted over the later tweets. She has the option to appeal but has not yet confirmed whether she will do so.  Ms Meloni's lawyer said she would donate any money she received to charity.  Responding to the verdict on X, Ms Cortese wrote: ""Italy's government has a serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent.  ""This country seems to get closer to [Viktor] Orbán's Hungary: these are bad times for independent journalists and opinion leaders. Let's hope for better days ahead. We won't give up!"" She later added that she was ""Italian and proud to be"" but that ""we deserve better than this appalling and shameful government"".",2024-07-19 23:10:22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnk41nnl125o,"Christy Cooney,",2024-07-18 23:10:22,

A council report showed the demolition scheme spent £460,000 more than planned last year. The authority blamed delays on the bird that resulted in additional costs. The council confirmed about 40 days were lost because of the nesting bird. The report said the overspend will be paid for by ""Coleg Gwent and a revenue budget contribution from the councils in 2023-24"". Costs it said, were being finalised.  Newport Centre, which was in Usk Way, has now been knocked down in preparation for a new Coleg Gwent campus. Demolition began in April 2023 at the site, which for decades was one of the city’s main leisure destinations. It included a swimming pool, and hosted big gigs with David Bowie and Elton John among stars to play there.

550,Father of Trump gunman called police about son before attack,"The father of the gunman who tried to assassinate Donald Trump called police before the Saturday shooting because he was concerned about his son, according to media reports.  The call is one of a number of red flags revealed in recent days that law enforcement was notified about before gunshots rang out at Trump's Pennsylvania rally on Saturday. Law enforcement - specifically the US Secret Service - has faced mounting questions about security with calls by some lawmakers that the head of the agency should resign.  Matthew Crooks' father called police because he was worried about his son and his whereabouts, a law enforcement source told the BBC's news partner CBS. It's unclear when the call was made but it was before the shooting.  It is unclear what his father told police. Fox News reported that Crooks’ parents, Mary and Matthew, told officers “they were worried” about their son and that he had disappeared without any advance notice. His parents are both co-operating in the investigation, the FBI has said. Law enforcement sources have told US media that the gunman had conducted online searches into a major depressive disorder and the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August. He had also saved images of Trump, President Joe Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Chris Wray and a member of the British Royal Family, according to reports from the Washington Post and Associated Press.  Investigators are still trying to trace a potential motive for the 20-year-old gunman, who was shot dead by Secret Service snipers after opening fire. His attack left one member of the audience dead and several others wounded.  The preliminary investigation has found that Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building outside the rally by climbing onto an air conditioning unit. The units were located next to the building, the unnamed official told CBS. A counter sniper flagged a suspicious man using a rangefinder to the US Secret Service some 20 minutes before the attack started, according to members of Congress briefed by law enforcement this week.  A rangefinder is an instrument that can be used to help measure the distance to a target. Local police initially spotted the gunman, who was acting strangely and had a backpack, about an hour before the shooting. They lost him in the crowd, but he was spotted again by the sniper.  Officers were alerted by radio about a suspicious person and searched the area where Crooks had perched his rifle on a rooftop.  Finding no one, one officer decided to check the roof. The officer was hoisted on to the roof by a colleague and came face-to-face with the suspect, Butler Township Manager Tom Knights told CBS. The suspect pointed a rifle at him and the officer, who was in a ""defenceless"" position, let go from the roof and fell to the ground.  He then alerted others to the gunman. Moments later, the shooting started. No weapon was spotted by law enforcement when Crooks was seen in the crowd and officials are trying to determine how no one saw his AR-style rifle.  Investigators are examining various theories, including that he had stashed it earlier in the day near the air conditioning units or that he was somehow able to smuggle it inside his backpack.  Retracing his footsteps in the hours before the attack will be key to understanding how the shooting unfolded, officials say. Officials told CBS that the semi-automatic rifle he used had been legally purchased by Crook's father in 2013. When the gunman was found, he was carrying a remote detonator and his car contained explosives, law enforcement sources have told US media.  It continues to remain unclear what motivated the attack, and whether any political ideology is to blame.",2024-07-19 23:10:22,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gr0nm0lzo,"Max Matza,",2024-07-19 00:10:22,
563,'Low-key sympathy as good as it gets for diminished Woods',"This video can not be played Tiger Woods gets huge ovation on the 18th Venue: Royal Troon Dates: Thu 18-Sun 21 July Coverage: Live radio and text commentary on BBC Sport website, with video clips each day. Daily highlights programme on BBC Two from 20:00 BST. Click for full details. Tiger Woods wasted no time.  From the 18th hole at Royal Troon, to the media mixed zone for a handful of questions, and then into the back of a car, with the engine running, and away.  Airport bound at 2.34pm. Private jet to Florida. Back home for dinner. Coming up 18, there was respectful applause for Woods and there was a different feel to it.  Slightly low-key. Sympathetic. There was a cry of, ‘Thanks for coming, Tiger’ which was well-meaning, but sounded a little cringe-making. Everybody, you sensed, was sad to see this version of him, but there’s no other version these days, alas. For the unsurpassable genius of yesteryear, this is as good as it gets now. Friday - a day that saw golf carnage visited upon the giants as much as the minnows - marked Woods’ third missed cut on the bounce in the majors this year.  He added a 77 to his 79 on Thursday, more high numbers to sit alongside his 74 and 73 at the US Open at Pinehurst, his 72 and 77 at the PGA at Valhalla, and his 73, 72, 82 and 77 at the Masters, where he finished last of those who made the cut. That’s 44- over par for Woods’ major championship season.  Lowry sets halfway target at Royal Troon Open The Open 2024: Second-round leaderboard  This video can not be played 'Terrific round of golf' - Lowry leads day two There was a milestone, of sorts, early in his second round on the blowy Ayrshire coast.  Out on the par-three fifth, Woods found one of those cavernous bunkers that makes you weep. He made bogey. A landmark, in a sense.  If you start counting from the major after he won at Augusta in 2019 - in other words, his past 14 - Woods was now a cumulative 100 over par. It got worse, of course. The par-five 16th was downwind on Friday with a burn at around 307 yards.  Woods, the master game-manager in his pomp, took out a driving iron and smashed it, the ball careering through the air and rolling into the hazard. Another error. In modern golf, there has been no better man to plot his way through trappy conditions, but that was the old Tiger.   His body has failed him. He’s a shadow of the force he once was and nothing is going to allow him to turn back time at this point, no matter how much he says it can be done and no matter how much his fans want to see it happen. By the time he pulled out of the gates and headed for the airport, he was 104 over for those majors. There are four 77s in that run, four 78s, two 79s and an 82. ""Well, it wasn't very good,"" he said. ""I made a double at two right out of the hopper when I needed to go the other way.   ""I just was fighting it pretty much all day. I never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently made a lot of bogeys."" This video can not be played 'Absolutely brilliant!' - Rahm & Rose feature in day two best shots There was a question hanging in the air and not a lot of time to get to it. Or questions, to be more precise.  Why is he doing this to himself? What enjoyment is he deriving from it? How could the greatest golfer most of us have ever seen - and are ever likely to see - take any solace from being a bit-part player on the stage he owned for so long? His body is in need of constant care, so there's little prospect of him ever playing enough golf to sharpen his game in lesser tournaments to prepare for the majors.  He's trapped in a cycle of mediocrity at best and it's become difficult to watch. ""I've gotten better, even though my results really haven't shown it,"" he said, with the kind of defiance - you might argue, delusion - that he displayed when saying on Tuesday he felt he could compete here this week. ""I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again.  ""I'm going to just keep getting physically better and keep working on it."" Had another missed cut - by a country mile - not proven a sobering experience?  ""No, I loved it,"" he replied.  Woods never lets his guard down but there was a barrier made of reinforced steel in front of him at that point.  Out there, getting blown off course, and hitting shots that his imperious, fitter self would never have hit, he did not look like a man who was loving anything bar the thought of the journey home. “I've always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,"" he said. ""Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn't as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did.” Will he be at Portrush next year? That was the Hail Mary question, the one dispatched in hope of a: 'No, I think I’m done, this is my last Open.'  Only in his comments and the way he straight bats questions is Tiger performing at his old, stratospheric level. ""Yeah, definitely."" Will he be back playing competitively in Scotland again? The chat is that The Open might well return to these shores in 2027 at Muirfield.   ""Yeah, I've won two Open Championships here in Scotland, so I've always enjoyed playing up here and enjoyed the different types of links that Scotland brings."" Woods was adamant that this will not be his last Open Championship Woods comes across as a man who's hating the struggle but can't let go.  There's been chin-stroking about his legacy and the damage he might be doing to it by hanging on, waiting for a better tomorrow that must know in his heart of hearts will not come. There is no danger to his legacy. None at all. The 15 major victories will live on.  The 11 years as world number one will probably never be matched. He won the Tiger Slam by finishing a combined 86 shots better than the next best player.  During 1997-2013 - his wonder years - he was 126 under par in majors. The next best, from players who had recorded at least 90 rounds, was 251 strokes behind.  You can fill the walls of golf's Hall of Fame with stats reflecting Woods' greatness. His toil at Troon, or anywhere else, is going to be forgotten in time. Who remembers how Jack Nicklaus finished as a professional golfer? He missed 10 cuts in his last 11 majors. He had one top-20 in his last 40.  Nobody cares. Nicklaus is revered for what he achieved and it will be that way for Woods, too. Nothing will impact that. You just wish that it didn't have to be this way right now. He raised his cap and smiled at the reception he received on the 18th green.  Gone for now, but returning for sure and still believing that there is one more miracle left inside him.",2024-07-19 23:10:23,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c4ng0rx2z69o,Tom English,2024-07-19 17:10:23,

Lowry, the 2019 champion, rolled in a 20-footer for birdie on the last as he followed his opening 66 with a two-under 69 to improve to seven under. ""To shoot in the 60s is very good any day on this course, even when the conditions aren't this bad. I'm very happy,"" he told BBC Sport NI, referring to the 30mph winds that were buffeting the links during his round. No Englishman has won the Claret Jug since Sir Nick Faldo in 1992 but two are leading the chasing pack on five under. Former US Open and Olympic champion Justin Rose holed a 40-foot birdie putt on the 18th to join Dan Brown, the world number 272 who was the surprise round one leader on six under and backed that up with a 72. ""That was a hard round of golf, a great round of golf,"" Rose told BBC Sport. When he teed off at 12:42 BST the 366-yard first hole was playing around 100 yards longer because of the strength of the wind and despite playing through the worst of the conditions, had only one bogey in a phenomenal 68. ""It was the type of day where the course was relentless. There was no let-up and it was nice to finish with a smile on my face,"" said the 43-year-old, who still ""dreams"" of winning an Open title 26 years after finishing fourth as a 17-year-old amateur at Royal Birkdale.

The American, who has already won six times this year, including the Masters in April, hit a 70 to join compatriot Billy Horschel (68) and South African Dean Burmester (69) on two under. Australia's Jason Day had a bogey-free 68 and sits alongside Canada's Corey Conners (70) on one under. Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele are also on that mark although Cantlay's 68 was four shots better than his good friend could manage to leave only 10 players under par. The halfway cut mark, which sees the top 70 players and ties play the final two rounds, came at six over par. Scotland's Robert MacIntyre is in on five over, while Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy is heading home on 11 over. Both posted 75s on Friday. MacIntyre fought back with four birdies after dropping a scarcely believable eight shots in his opening four holes.  ""That was carnage,"" said the newly crowned Scottish Open champion. ""When I made that eight on four, my head was completely gone. I didn't think I was going to make the weekend, it was just about fighting and the fans helped me a long way."" Like MacIntyre, McIlroy had a triple-bogey eight at the fourth and he was 13 over after the sixth as he failed to cope with the wind. Two late birdies in calmer conditions brought a rueful smile but his chase for a fifth major now extends beyond a decade. ""I didn't adapt well and the wind got the better of me,"" he simply said. This video can not be played Tiger Woods gets huge ovation on the 18th Tiger Woods once again drew the biggest following of the morning starters and was afforded a huge ovation on the 18th as he closed with a six-over 77 that left him at 14 over. There has been much speculation regarding the three-time Open champion's future, given his lack of competitiveness after missing the cut at the past three majors and finishing last at the Masters, as he continues to recover from injuries sustained in a 2021 car crash. However, when asked if he would be at Portrush for next year's Championship, the 48-year-old replied: ""Definitely. ""I just wanted to make sure that I was able to play the major championships this year. ""I've got better, even though my results really haven't shown it, but physically I've got better.  ""I just need to keep progressing and getting into the competitive flow again."" Lowry birdied the first, fourth and eighth holes in relatively benign conditions as he reached seven under at the turn. But all his patient work threatened to unravel on the feared Railway. The par-four 11th has been the toughest hole at the past three Troon Opens and Lowry found trouble off the tee with a slightly wayward drive into rough. From there he hit what former Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew called an ""inexplicable hook"" straight across the fairway and deep into a gorse bush. He eventually stalked off the green with a double-bogey six and back where he started the day. However, he steadied himself with four straight pars before closing with birdies on the 16th and 18th holes. ""I faced a little bit of adversity in the middle of the round and I'm happy with how I dealt with it,"" he told BBC Sport NI. ""I moved on and hit some great shots coming in.  ""I've got 24 hours until my tee time [on Saturday]. ""I'm going to go home, chill out and soak it all in and then give it my best."" Brown continues to be the surprise package of this 152nd Open Championship. The 29-year-old from North Yorkshire, playing in his first Open, dropped two shots in his opening nine holes but refused to fade away, with birdies on the 10th and 16th bringing him back to six under before a third bogey of the day on 17.  ""It was always going to be tricky to back up what I did [on Thursday],"" Brown told BBC Sport.  ""The conditions didn’t really allow that so it was just very much managing your expectations. It did feel more of a grind."" He is a former English amateur champion and won his first Tour event last year in Northern Ireland. Finishing 61st at last week's Scottish Open ended a run of seven missed cuts and a withdrawal in his previous eight tournaments. ""A lot of people probably didn’t know who I was coming into this week, but I feel good and at home with links golf,"" said Brown, who holed a 20-foot putt at West Lancashire on 2 July to claim the last of four qualifying spots from that event.

561,'Day in the dirt start of England's life after Anderson',"This video can not be played Highlights: West Indies trail by 65 runs against England Maybe this was the time when James Anderson was glad to have been ushered into retirement. Now a former England player, Anderson had the luxury of a seat in the dressing room, rather than a day in the dirt, as his old team-mates were slow roasted by Kavem Hodge in the Trent Bridge sun.  West Indies ended day two of the second Test on 351-5, 65 behind, revitalised and alive in the series. As a newly appointed consultant, Anderson has been teaching Ben Stokes how to bowl the wobble seam and throwing the ball for Brendon McCullum to edge to the slip fielders for catching practice, the latter lacking the accuracy of his bowling. Was it inevitable that England would toil as soon as the post-Anderson era began? Did Stokes ever glance to the pavilion and wonder if he made a horrible mistake? At one point, spectators in the Fox Road Stand started chanting Anderson's name. England’s reliance on Anderson and his old mate Stuart Broad means this is the first home Test in 12 years that neither have featured. None of the current XI would have ever known a home match without at least one of Branderson in the side. Where would the great pair have taken England on Friday? A question impossible to answer, but it is not too much of a leap to suggest even two GOATs would have found it a slog. This was hard yakka in hot sun on an unresponsive pitch with a ball less likely to misbehave than a child on Christmas Eve. There was much less swing and seam movement than the 10-year average for the second day of Tests in England, until the hosts finally got a fourth-change nut to wobble around late in the day. These were the sort of conditions where England have often struggled, even with Anderson and Broad in the side. Australian, almost. If the planning is for an Ashes in Australia, then this was much more useful than rolling over an underprepared Windies at Lord’s in a glorified Anderson testimonial. Hodge hundred rallies Windies and defies England Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Hodge hits hundred to punish England England's bowling has evolved in rapid fashion. From the first Ashes Test last summer, Anderson and Broad have taken their pipe and slippers, while Ollie Robinson is on the naughty step. Moeen Ali is another in Test retirement and the man he covered, Jack Leach, has been overlooked. It might be a stretch to say the attack has been refreshed when it contains 35-year-old Chris Woakes and 34-year-old Mark Wood, though Shoaib Bashir only made his first-class debut last June and Gus Atkinson is England’s new-ball bowler despite opening on just three previous occasions for Surrey. Of the quartet, it is Woakes who is coming under most scrutiny, curious for a man who transformed the Ashes and walked away as player of the series. The question is logical enough. If Anderson is being pensioned off at 41 because he won't make it to Australia then why is Woakes, an inferior bowler (that's not an insult, most bowlers are inferior to Anderson) and suffering from chronic travel sickness (he averages more than 50 overseas compared to 22 at home), England's new attack leader? Stokes said he couldn't answer the question without sounding ""ageist"" and admitted that all who remain in the squad are in contention for the Ashes tour. Woakes' ability to score runs at number eight is a key advantage. Yes, he was overlooked for the tour of India, albeit in a squad containing three fast bowlers in a series where England sometimes only played one. If five or six are to travel to Australia, there is a role for him, providing lower-order ballast and bowling legs to the likes of Wood, Atkinson, Josh Tongue and maybe Jofra Archer, who would be used in short bursts. It has been a tough period for Woakes following the death of his father and he was down on pace on Friday in Nottingham, but showed his worth to come back energised late in the day and claim the crucial wicket of Hodge. Pace is not lacking for Wood, who England would quite happily cryogenically freeze for the next year and a bit to ensure he is on the plane down under. His bowling at Trent Bridge was electrifying, the fastest ever recorded by an England bowler in a home Test. This video can not be played 'The crowd has lifted' - Wood bowls an average speed of 94.5mph in his first over Such was the fire and brimstone wrought by Wood, Hodge pleaded for mercy by telling the bowler he had a ""wife and kids"" back in Dominica. Somehow Wood went wicketless and will have other days when he bowls worse and claims a hatful. For Atkinson, this was the reality of Test cricket after the Playstation stuff of claiming 12 wickets on debut at Lord’s. He is learning on the job as a new-ball bowler, and his partnership alongside Wood was England’s paciest since Wood and Olly Stone combined against New Zealand three years ago. There was a period when West Indies had nowhere to hide. It was actually Bashir who benefitted from the work done by Wood and Atkinson, as both Mikyle Louis and Kirk McKenzie were softened up by the pace, then suckered in by the spin. At 20 years and 280 days, Bashir became the youngest England spinner since Denis Compton in 1937 to take a wicket in a home Test. England think his height is a crucial asset and his release point of 2.34m is the third-highest recorded for a spinner. Stokes initially asked Bashir to bowl a 17-over spell, one that started tightly then gradually leaked runs as Hodge and Alick Athanaze worked him out. How Bashir can develop his craft to counter Australians that will want to eat him for breakfast will be key to his success. Perhaps, though, it is not the rebooted bowling where England need to learn, and instead revisit lessons from long ago. It seems churlish to question their first-day 416, yet there is no doubt the hosts wasted an even bigger total thanks to some sloppy dismissals. Dropped catches are an illness that England struggle to cure and the slip chance put down by Joe Root off Hodge changed the course of the match. Ruthlessness with the bat and efficiency in the field are crucial to England, regardless of the bowlers they pick.

560,Hodge hundred rallies Windies and defies England,"This video can not be played Highlights: West Indies trail by 65 runs against England Second Rothesay Test (day two of five), Trent Bridge England 416: Pope 121, Duckett 71, Stokes 69; A Joseph 3-98 West Indies 351-5: Hodge 120, Athanaze 82; Bashir 2-100 West Indies trail by 65 runs Scorecard Kavem Hodge’s maiden century rallied West Indies and defied England on a compelling second day of the second Test at Trent Bridge. Hodge, a 31-year-old playing only his fourth Test, should have been caught on 16 by Joe Root, but instead went on to make 120 to breathe life into the tourists and the series. From 84-3 in response to England’s 416, Hodge added 175 for the fourth wicket with the similarly impressive Alick Athanaze, who contributed 82. Hodge reached his century by driving Ben Stokes for four and celebrated by leaping into the arms of batting partner Jason Holder. He was eventually lbw to Chris Woakes, leaving Holder and Joshua da Silva to take West Indies to 351-5, 65 behind. In sapping heat, England worked hard in their first day in the field since the retirement of bowler James Anderson. Mark Wood enthralled the crowd with some lightning-fast bowling, but had to leave the field in the evening session with what England hope is nothing more serious than cramp. 'Day in the dirt start of England's life after Anderson' Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Hodge hits hundred to punish England This video can not be played 'This is what we wanted' - Carlos Brathwaite With Trent Bridge sparkling in some long-awaited sunshine, this was a heartening day of Test cricket, as West Indies displayed the sort of spirit and skill that saw them triumph over Australia in Brisbane in January. Even England fans who revelled in their team steamrolling the visitors in little more than two days in the first Test at Lord’s will agree that this was a more enjoyable spectacle and a greater showing of health for the five-day game. Hodge was magnificent. Yes, everything about the conditions were ideal for batting, yet some of his team-mates had already wasted their chance through some awful strokes. Supported by Athanaze, he has put West Indies into a position from which they have a chance of levelling the series. England, without Anderson and Stuart Broad in a home Test for the first time in 12 years, did little wrong and are probably learning more than at Lord’s. Wood was scintillating, at one stage bowling in excess of 97mph, only to later pull up in his 15th over. However, England’s cessation of control is down to some old frailties. Their 416 in the first innings was a good total, though their wastefulness prevented it from being impregnable. If Root had held his straightforward chance at first slip, perhaps England would have been batting again before the end of the day. Stokes’ side may well go on to win this match, but they are in a battle. The contest is all the richer for it. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Kavem Hodge's century Hodge is a personality, one who went viral on the tour of Australia for talking through the stump microphone. Here he showed that his character also includes determination, bravery and pizzazz to score a fabulous hundred. Starting their reply at the beginning of the day, West Indies were improved on Lord’s but repeated mistakes. Mikyle Louis and Kirk McKenzie were softened up by pace then hacked at Shoaib Bashir, while captain Kraigg Brathwaite got into a tangle at a Gus Atkinson bouncer on 48. Hodge joined Athanaze and began carefully, taking only eight from his first 43 deliveries. If his edge to Root off Wood was taken, West Indies would have been 140-4. England peppered both men. Whereas Hodge was willing to pull and hook, Athanaze, an attractive driver, ducked into a Wood bouncer on 48. The left-hander completed his maiden Test half-century and could have had a hundred of his own, only to drive Stokes to gully. Hodge remained and his punch past mid-off to go to three figures was followed by elated celebrations. The image of him embracing Holder will live long in the memory. When he was finally trapped on the crease by Woakes, Hodge watched as a review failed to save him and threw his bat in the air in frustration. He left to a rapturous ovation. This video can not be played 'The crowd has lifted' - Wood bowls an average speed of 94.5mph in his first over England make no secret of their desire for pace and, in Wood, have one of their fastest ever and perhaps the quickest in the world right now. His first over averaged 94.4mph, the fastest recorded by an England bowler in home Tests. Wood bettered that in his next, averaging 94.5. The crowd gasped each time Wood’s speeds were displayed on the big screen and he did not dip below 90mph until his fifth over. Bashir was asked to bowl a long spell, taking his first home wickets in the process. Atkinson, like Wood, was used in short bursts. For a while, Woakes, anointed by Stokes as the new attack leader, was down on pace and ineffective. Yet, with the ball changed three times, England finally got the fourth to move and Woakes came into the game. After the luckless Wood repeatedly passed the edge, it was Woakes who got the crucial wicket of Hodge in an excellent spell late in the day. England delayed taking the second new ball until the final over the day, which Holder and Da Silva came through to end on 23 and 32 respectively.

Briton Cameron, 33, was outpointed by Taylor in Dublin in November, having beaten the Irishwoman on points in their first meeting in May 2023. The Northampton fighter returns to the ring against Elhem Mekhaled in Birmingham's Resort World Arena on Saturday. ""I'm on a mission for my belts and I want to get them as soon as I can,"" Cameron told BBC Sport. Cameron unified the division against Jessica McCaskill in 2022, becoming the first English boxer to hold all four recognised world titles. Her breakthrough into boxing's mainstream, however, came through two high-quality contests with Irish superstar Taylor. Having inflicted a first career defeat on Taylor, Cameron too lost for the first time in the rematch, before negotiations for a third bout stalled. ""I don't think Katie wants to fight me again,"" Cameron said. ""She knows she got that win in November and she'd rather not fight me. I'd be very optimistic of winning a third fight."" Cameron (left) and Taylor exchange punches during their epic rematch at the 3Arena in Dublin  Cameron stresses the importance of ""not getting complacent by overlooking"" durable Frenchwoman Mekhaled. Mekhaled, 33, has won 12 pro bouts, with her two losses coming against world-class fighters Delfine Persoon and Alycia Baumgardner. ""I think I'm the best 140lb fighter and so I won't take easy fights and try to con my supporters who are buying tickets,"" Cameron added. Cameron will be backed by a new-look team, having relocated from Manchester to Sheffield by replacing trainer Jamie Moore with Grant Smith.  She will also be competing under the Queensberry Promotions banner after parting ways with Matchroom Boxing. ""It wasn't about the loss - no matter what happened in my last fight I was going to make the changes,"" Cameron added. ""I needed something new, new eyes on me to give me that fire again and get that hunger and love back for boxing. ""I have had my first loss and have nothing to lose now.

557,Howe 'committed' to Newcastle amid England job links,"This video can not be played Newcastle United: Eddie Howe says his commitment to club is 'unwavering' Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe says he is ""committed"" to the club as long as he is ""happy and feels supported"", after being linked with replacing Gareth Southgate as England manager. Southgate, who was appointed in 2016, resigned on Tuesday in the wake of England's 2-1 defeat by Spain in the Euro 2024 final. Howe has emerged as a leading contender for the job, although Newcastle chief executive Darren Eales has said the club are determined to keep him.   ""It is an unbelievable football club. I’m very, very proud to be the manager,"" said Howe, who was speaking to BBC Radio Newcastle from the Magpies' training camp in Germany. ""I love the supporters, I love the players, I love the staff. So really, there has been no thought in my mind on anything else and I have been very committed to the job here. ""For me, as long as I am happy and feel supported and feel free to do the work that I love to do at Newcastle, I’ll be very happy - and I am very happy."" 'Win a major tournament' - FA reveals England job spec Potter ready for next job as he salutes Southgate Postecoglou has 'no idea' about England job links Howe was appointed Newcastle manager in November 2021 shortly after the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of the club and steered them away from relegation that season. He then guided Newcastle to a fourth-place Premier League finish in the 2022-23 campaign as the Magpies qualified for the Champions League. Howe signed what Eales described as a ""multi-year"" contract extension last summer before Newcastle United finished seventh in the Premier League. Their first game of the 2024-25 season is at home to Southampton on 17 August. Asked if he expects to start the season as Newcastle manager amid links with England, Howe said: ""Of course that is my expectation because I am the manager of Newcastle and I am very proud to be.  ""But as I said, it is all about the environment I am working in. As long as that is one where I feel I can give my best, then absolutely, we will crack on and I am looking forward to next season."" England are next in action against the Republic of Ireland on 7 September in the Nations League. An interim manager will be in charge if the Football Association (FA) is still to appoint Southgate's successor at that point. ""I’m absolutely honoured and privileged to be manager of Newcastle United. I hope that is for many, many years,"" Howe added.  ""My commitment is unwavering. I am determined to win a trophy for the football club - that is in my psyche every day. I want to see joy in the supporters. I want to bring that to them, hopefully."" Newcastle sold Elliot Anderson (left) and Yankuba Minteh (right) to Nottingham Forest and Brighton respectively Newcastle were forced to generate funds late into June in order to comply with the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules (PSR). On 30 June, the final day clubs could buy or sell players in order for them to fall into accounts for the 2023-24 season, Newcastle sold midfielder Elliot Anderson, 21, to Nottingham Forest and winger Yakuba Minteh, 19, to Brighton to generate funds. Minteh’s exit recouped £30m to the Magpies, while Anderson’s was for a reported £35m.  Meanwhile, Newcastle signed goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos from Forest on the same day. Howe says that while the sales were best for the club, he did not want to lose either player. “PSR was tight. It was very late, a lot of the things that happened, but it’s a great outcome,” Howe explained. “A great outcome but very sad to lose Yankuba and Elliot, two outstanding young players. “I would’ve loved to have kept them - I think they are two outstanding young players and really disappointed to lose them both. “But, I think we were backed into a corner. We were in a very difficult position. I think it was as good an outcome as we could have hoped for, but we were sad.” Sandro Tonali has not played for Newcastle since 25 October 2023 Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali has been training with the squad during pre-season before his return to action next month. Tonali, 24, has been serving a 10-month ban from football since 26 October for breaching betting rules. The midfielder is available for selection from the end of next month and Howe says that now Tonali is closing in on a return to action, he believes the former AC Milan player has got his “edge” back. “I think he’s in a good place. I think he’s come back fit,” said Howe. “I see a slight difference in Sandy now because he knows he’s close [to returning], and for a player knowing they’re not going to be picked for 10 months, that is very tough mentally to have that edge to your game. “His edge is there now because he knows it is around the corner.

555,"Belarus sentences German medic to death, activists say","A court in Belarus has sentenced a German medic to death after he was found guilty  of charges related to terrorism and mercenary activity, rights activists have said.  Rico Krieger, 30, was convicted of six crimes in a closed trial in June, Viasna, one of Belarus' top activist organisations, said in a statement. The group said he now faced execution by firing squad. What prompted the charges remains unclear, and the country's state news agency carried no further details about the allegations in its report. Belarus is the last country in Europe where the death penalty is still carried out. It says it reserves the sentence for serious crimes, including treason.  Viasna said that Mr Krieger's alleged crimes included mercenary work, espionage, terrorism, creating an extremist group, illegal operations with firearms and explosives.  It said it marked the first time someone had been tried in Belarus for mercenary activity.  The group, based in the Belarusian capital Minsk, said that Mr Krieger, who was working as a medic for the German Red Cross, had been in custody since November 2023.  Parts of the trial were carried out behind closed doors and Viasna added that it was unsure whether Mr Krieger has appealed against the verdict, or whether it has gone into effect.  His LinkedIn profile showed that he previously worked as a security officer at the US embassy in Berlin, before moving into healthcare working as a nurse and specialising in emergency medicine. Viasna suggested that the charges facing Mr Krieger could stem from his alleged involvement with the Kastuś Kalinoŭski Regiment, a group of Belarusian citizens who volunteered to fight Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The BBC cannot independently verify this.  The regiment is named after the Belarusian-Polish writer, journalist and lawyer, who was executed in 1864 for leading a revolt against Russia.  It is not immediately clear what connection Mr Krieger may have had to the group.  Opposition media in Belarus reported that he may have been linked to a unit within the regiment known as the ""Western"" battalion.  In a short statement the German foreign ministry confirmed that one of its citizens had been sentenced to death in Minsk, but it did not name Mr Krieger directly.  ""The Foreign Office and the embassy in Minsk are giving the person in question consular support and are working intensively with Belarusian authorities on his behalf,"" the ministry said, adding Germany considered the death penalty as ""a cruel and inhumane form of punishment"". ""We are working worldwide for its abolition"", the statement said.  In a post on X, Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, said she was ""concerned by news"".  Alexander Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994. He long sought to play the EU and Russia off against each other, while retaining power in Minsk.  But he has been forced to rely increasingly on Russian President Vladimir Putin since mass protests gripped the country after he claimed victory in the 2020 presidential election over Ms Tsikhanouskaya.  The West has refused to recognise his claim. ",2024-07-19 23:10:23,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c06ke3p0pz8o,"Lipika Pelham,",2024-07-19 20:10:23,
554,Crowdstrike and Microsoft: What we know about global IT outage,"A massive tech failure has caused travel chaos around the world, with banking and healthcare services also badly hit. Flights have been grounded because of the IT outage - a flaw which left many computers displaying blue error screens. There were long queues, delays and flight cancellations at airports around the world, as passengers had to be manually checked in. Cyber-security firm Crowdstrike has admitted that the problem was caused by an update to its antivirus software, which is designed to protect Microsoft Windows devices from malicious attacks. Microsoft has said it is taking ""mitigation action"" to deal with ""the lingering impact"" of the outage. Here is a summary of what we know so far. This is still a little unclear.  Crowdstrike is known for producing antivirus software, intended to prevent hackers from causing this very type of disruption. According to Crowdstrike boss George Kurtz, the issues are only impacting  Windows PCs and no other operating systems, and were caused by a defect in a recent update. ""The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,"" he said. ""This is not a security incident or cyber-attack."" What exactly was wrong with the update is yet to be revealed, but as a potential fix involves deleting a single file, it is possible that just one rogue file could be at the root of all the mayhem. It could be some time. Crowdstrike's Mr Kurtz, speaking to NBC News, said it was the firm's ""mission"" to make sure every one of its customers recovered completely from the outage. ""We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our companies,"" he said. He has since told CNBC that while some systems can be fixed quickly, for others it ""could be hours, could be a bit longer"". Crowdstrike has issued its fix. But according to those in the know, it will have to be applied separately to each and every device affected. Computers will require a manual reboot in safe mode - causing a massive headache for IT departments everywhere. Something important to note here, is that personal devices like your home computer or mobile phone are unlikely to have been affected - this outage is impacting businesses. Microsoft is advising clients to try a classic method to get things working - turning it off and on again - in some cases up to 15 times. The tech giant said this has worked for some users of virtual machines – PCs where the computer is not in the same place as the screen. “Several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,"" it said. It is also telling customers with more in-depth computing knowledge that they should delete a certain file - the same solution one CrowdStrike employee has been sharing on social media. But this fix is intended for experts and IT professionals, not regular users. The problems have emerged across the world, but were first noticed in Australia, and possibly felt most severely in the air travel industry, with more than 3,300 flights cancelled globally. Meanwhile, the problems have also hit payment systems, banking and healthcare providers around the world. Railway companies, including Britain’s biggest which runs Southern, Thameslink, Gatwick Express and Great Northern, warned passengers to expect delays. In Alaska, the 911 emergency service was affected, while Sky News was off air for several hours on Friday morning, unable to broadcast. The outage might also impact people getting paid on time. Melanie Pizzey, head of the Global Payroll Association, told PA news agency that she'd been contacted by ""numerous clients"" who couldn't access their payroll software. She said the outage could mean firms are unable to process staff payments this week, but there may be a knock-on effect too. ""We could see a backlog with regard to processing payrolls for the coming month end, which may delay employees from receiving their monthly wage,"" she said. If you're worried about your own, personal devices, we have some good news. The software at the centre of this outage is generally used by businesses, which means that most people's personal computers won't be impacted. That means if you're wondering whether you need to delete a certain file to avoid your computer restarting constantly, the simple answer is no, you don't. It's a reminder of the complexity of our modern digital infrastructure that Crowdstrike, a company that's not exactly a household name, can be at the heart of such worldwide disarray. The US firm, based in Austin, Texas, is a listed company on the US stock exchange, featuring in both the S&P 500 and the high-tech Nasdaq indexes. Like a lot of modern technology companies, it hasn't been around that long. It was founded a mere 13 years ago, but has grown to employ nearly 8,500 people. As a provider of cyber-security services, it tends to get called in to deal with the aftermath of hack attacks. It has been involved in investigations of several high-profile cyber-attacks, such as when Sony Pictures had its computer system hacked in 2014.  But this time, because of a flawed update to its software, a firm that is normally part of the solution to IT problems has instead caused one. In its last earnings report, Crowdstrike declared a total of nearly 24,000 customers. That's an indication not just of the size of the issue, but also the difficulties that could be involved in fixing it. Each of those customers is a huge organisation in itself, so the number of individual computers affected is hard to estimate.

558,US policeman who joked about India woman's death fired,"A US police officer has been fired for saying that an Indian student's life was of ""limited value"" after she died last year. The Seattle Police Department said that officer Daniel Auderer's comments about Jaahnavi Kandula's death were ""vile"" and callous"", The Seattle Times reported. Kandula, 23, was fatally struck down in January by another police vehicle while she was crossing a street near her university. Daniel Auderer - who was responding to the incident - was recorded laughing and saying that she was a ""regular person"" and the city should ""just write a cheque"". The footage was captured on his body camera while he had made a call to a colleague. ""But she is dead,"" the officer was heard saying before laughing. ""No, it's a regular person. Yeah, just write a cheque,"" he said, before laughing again. ""Eleven thousand dollars. She was 26, anyway. She had limited value,"" he added. The video was widely circulated on social media and sparked outrage online. On Wednesday, Seattle Police Department's interim chief Sue Rahr announced the policeman's termination through a department-wide email. His actions had brought shame on the entire department and the police profession, she wrote. Interim chief Rahr added that his ""cruel and callous laughter” and the pain it had inflicted on Kandula’s family could not outweigh Daniel Auderer’s good reputation among his colleagues and his years of service to the community. ""For me to allow the officer to remain on our force would only bring further dishonour to the entire department. For that reason, I am going to terminate his employment,” she said. Daniel Audered had been placed under investigation after the incident. The Office of Police Accountability - the agency that investigates police misconduct - had recommended his termination for unprofessional conduct and showing bias in recorded statements, the Seattle Times reported. Jaahnavi Kandula was a graduate student at Northeastern University in Seattle.  The officer who rammed her with his patrol vehicle was going at 74mph (119km/h) and she was thrown more than 100ft (30m),  US media reports said.",2024-07-19 23:10:23,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3848dx6ngo,Unknown,2024-07-19 05:10:23,
564,Israel strikes Houthis in Yemen after drone hits Tel Aviv,"Israel has launched air strikes on the Houthi-controlled Red Sea port of Hodeidah in  Yemen, a day after a drone launched by the group hit Tel Aviv Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said his country aimed to send a message to the Houthi movement. ""The fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,"" he said. Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a ""brutal Israel aggression against Yemen"". He said the strikes were aimed at pressuring the Houthis to stop supporting the Palestinians in Gaza, something he said would not happen. It is the first time Israel has responded directly to what it says have been hundreds of Yemeni drone and missile attacks aimed at its territory in recent months. Footage from Hodeidah showed huge fires raging on Saturday evening. The Houthi-run government in Sanaa said Israel struck oil storage facilities close to the shore, as well as a nearby power plant.  The Houthi-run health ministry claimed 80 people had been injured, ""most of them with severe burns"", but did not say if anyone had been killed.  In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""After nine months of continuous aerial attacks by the Houthis in Yemen toward Israel, IAF [Israeli Air Force] fighter jets conducted an extensive operational strike over 1,800km [1,118 miles) away against Houthi terrorist military targets"" in the area of the port of Hodeidah. ""The IDF is capable of operating anywhere required and will strike any force that endangers Israelis,"" the statement said, adding that Saturday's operation was codenamed Outstretched Arm. Mr Gallant said the Israeli jets had struck the group because they had harmed Israelis. ""The Houthis attacked us over 200 times. The first time that they harmed an Israeli citizen, we struck them. And we will do this in any place where it may be required,"" he said. Speaking on Saturday evening after the attacks, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would defend itself ""by all means"". ""Anyone who harms us will pay a very heavy price for their aggression,"" he said in a televised address, claiming the port was an entry point for Iranian weapons. He also said it showed Israel's enemies there was no place it could not reach. On Friday a block of flats in Tel Aviv was hit by what an Israeli military official said was an Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which had been modified to fly long distance. The Houthis said it carried out that attack, and vowed to stage more. The attack killed a 50-year-old man who had recently moved to Israel from Belarus and injured eight others. The Israeli military official said its defence forces had detected the incoming drone but had not tried to shoot it down because of ""human error"". Previously, almost all Houthi missiles and drones fired towards Israel had been intercepted and none were known to have reached Tel Aviv. The Houthi Supreme Political Council, the movement's executive body, was quoted by Houthi-run media on Saturday evening saying that there would be an ""effective response"" to the airstrikes.  Although Israel has not struck the Houthis in Yemen before, the US and UK have been launching air strikes against the group for months to try to stop the Houthis from attacking commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The Houthis initially said they were attacking ships connected with Israel, or heading to or from there. However, many of the vessels have no connection with Israel and since air strikes began the group has also targeted vessels linked to the UK and US.",2024-07-20 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g68g11445o,"Tom Spender and Paul Adams,",2024-07-20 22:08:58,
565,Inside Canada's booze battle over canned cocktails,"Last week, Ontario Premier Doug Ford posted a video online with a message for his Canadian province. It seemed like a typical innocuous political advertisement - Mr Ford sporting a casual black polo shirt and a blue apron, standing at a barbecue grilling burgers, cans of beer at hand. “It’s summertime in Ontario,” the premier said, beaming into the camera. Instead, the video was a shot across the bow, with the premier launching an interactive map of local breweries, wineries and distilleries.  It was a strategic move in the midst of liquor labour dispute that has snarled summer alcohol sales in Canada's most populous province.  For the first time in its history, workers at Ontario’s liquor retailer are on strike. The battle has shone a spotlight on the province's peculiar and, some say, outdated liquor control system. On 5 July, the more than 9,000 employees of the provincially-owned Liquor Board of Ontario (LCBO) walked off the job after negotiations for a new collective agreement between their union and Mr Ford’s government fell apart. The LCBO then shuttered all its 650 stores for at least two weeks. This week, the Ontario Public Services Employees Union (OPSEU) returned to the bargaining table with the province. But talks resumed after another salvo from Mr Ford: the premier has promised to accelerate plans to put canned cocktails in privately-run retailers - the primary sticking point for the union. For a brief moment on Friday, it seemed the dispute was resolved, after the union representing LCBO workers announced that a tentative deal had been reached that would reopen liquor stores in a few days.  But it backtracked during a scheduled news conference with reporters that lasted just two minutes, during which they claimed that Mr Ford's government had refused to sign their return-to-work order.  ""We were prepared to come here to announce a deal,"" said union spokesperson Katie Arnup. ""We do not have a deal. The strike continues."" Soon after, the LCBO told its side of the story: It accused the workers' union of negotiating in ""bad faith"", saying it introduced new demands around money that should have been dealt with at the bargaining table. It also vowed to file an unfair labour complaint against the union, signalling that the fight is not yet over. The LCBOs scattered through Ontario today - generally well-stocked, clean and some consumers will argue, overpriced - are the product of a nearly century-old decision that gave the Crown corporation control over the distribution and sale of liquor in the province. For years, the whole system maintained distinctive traces of temperance-era policy.  Customers were required to obtain a separate liquor permit before placing an order with a clerk, who could deny any order they believed was too large. Alcohol was not openly displayed. Stores were hidden away from main streets, and purchases were packed away in discreet paper bags. Slowly, starting in the 1950s and 1960s, the LCBO evolved into a more consumer-friendly operation, now with wine tasting and free drink samples and a glossy LCBO-branded food and drink magazine. (Though self-service, which allows customers to grab their preferred alcohol directly off store shelves, was only fully phased in by the late 1980s).  Ontarians could get beer from the brewer consortium-owned The Beer Store and, later, in the 1990s, Ontario-made wine from The Wine Rack, owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.  But for the most part the LCBO has enjoyed an iron-clad monopoly on Ontario alcohol sales.  As most other provinces, like Alberta, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, moved to liberalise their liquor sales and allow for privately-run stores, Ontario stayed mostly the same. In 2015, things started to shift. The first grocery stores in Ontario were authorised to sell six-packs of beer - a change described at the time as the biggest shake-up to alcohol sales since Prohibition.  “It was one small purchase for a politician, one giant leap for Ontario beer consumers,” read one article in the Toronto Star of the very first grocery store beer purchase by then Premier Kathleen Wynne.  Today, 450 grocery stores across the province are licensed to sell beer, wine and cider. So amid the strike, Ontarians are not facing an entirely dry summer. They can still place limited LCBO delivery orders online, and purchase wine, beer and cider from some stores.  A bigger change is now around the corner.  Starting this month, convenience stores, big-box stores and grocers will all be eligible to sell wine, beer, cider and ready-to-drink cocktails like hard seltzers. OPSEU says pre-made cocktails pose an existential crisis to the LCBO's business. “This is our line in the sand and we are making history,” said president JP Hornick on the first day of the strike.  “We are here today because of the Ford government’s plan to try and expand privatisation of alcohol sales… That puts every Ontarian at risk.” And, OPSEU says, the change threatens the C$2.5bn ($1.83bn; £1.42bn) LCBO sales net for provincial coffers.  But Mr Ford argues the plan will give small businesses a shot at the market while still leaving the LCBO with a considerable competitive advantage.  Under the new plan, the LCBO remains the only retailer of high-alcohol spirits like gin and whisky, as well as the only wholesaler and primary distributor of alcohol in Ontario. ""Keep in mind when, when you're the wholesaler, that's where you make money,"" the premier said last week. The proposal also gives Mr Ford a chance to deliver on a pledge in time for the next election, currently scheduled for 2026. “He campaigned on this,” said Walid Hejazi at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. “It’s a winning issue for the Conservatives,” added Mr Hejazi, who noted he worked as a consultant for the LCBO about 15 years ago. “The province is proposing a strategy that will lower the price I have to pay and make it more convenient… who doesn’t want cheaper alcohol and more convenience?” Another problem for the LCBO is that the sting of the LCBO's strike has been dulled considerably by the small amount of liquor liberalisation the province already has. Ontarians, for the most part, are not up in arms, with access to alcohol at hundreds of wineries, grocery stores and beer stores that remain open. “What if you went on strike and hardly anyone noticed?” read the first line of a Globe and Mail editorial. Public polling has seemed to reflect the ambivalence, with just 15% of Ontarians  saying they have been personally affected by the strike.  (A tourism industry group says the strike is affecting the operations of 35% of poll respondents in the sector due to limited product availability and slow fulfillment). But they aren't necessarily on Team Ford, either. An internal poll by Mr Ford's government indicates that while many support liquor liberalisation, a little over half back the  strike action.  Many Ontarians did, however, take notice of the Conservative premier's interactive alcohol retail map, which may have annoyed more voters than the shuttered stores. The province’s efforts to unveil an alcohol-finder soon after the strike began raised questions about the government’s priorities, with one resident suggesting a better use would be a map of family doctors that are accepting new patients.  Dr Adil Shamji, a provincial Liberal politician, said he ""routinely"" gets calls from constituents for help finding doctors, childcare or affordable housing.  ""Never, including after this strike, have I had people calling my office asking for help in finding booze,"" he said.  Dr Shamji said he wants both sides to get back to get a deal done, one with protections for the LCBO. For his part, Mr Ford says he is ready to keep negotiating but on canned cocktails at least, he is not budging. ""If they want to negotiate over [ready-to-drink beverages], the deal's off. I'm gonna repeat that: that ship has sailed,"" he said.",2024-07-20 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjl69zk8y13o,"Holly Honderich & Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-19 23:08:58,
566,"CrowdStrike IT outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices, Microsoft says","Microsoft says it estimates that 8.5m computers around the world were disabled by the global IT outage. It’s the first time a figure has been put on the incident and suggests it could be the worst cyber event in history. The glitch came from a security company called CrowdStrike which sent out a corrupted software update to its huge number of customers. Microsoft, which is helping customers recover said in a blog post: ""we currently estimate that CrowdStrike’s update affected 8.5 million Windows devices."" The post by David Weston, vice-president at the firm, says this number is less than 1% of all Windows machines worldwide, but that ""the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services"". The company can be very accurate on how many devices were disabled by the outage as it has performance telemetry to many by their internet connections. The tech giant - which was keen to point out that this was not an issue with its software - says the incident highlights how important it is for companies such as CrowdStrike to use quality control checks on updates before sending them out. “It’s also a reminder of how important it is for all of us across the tech ecosystem to prioritize operating with safe deployment and disaster recovery using the mechanisms that exist,” Mr Weston said. The fall out from the IT glitch has been enormous and was already one of the worst cyber-incidents in history. The number given by Microsoft means it is probably the largest ever cyber-event, eclipsing all previous hacks and outages. The closest to this is the WannaCry cyber-attack in 2017 that is estimated to have impacted around 300,000 computers in 150 countries. There was a similar costly and disruptive attack called NotPetya a month later. There was also a major six-hour outage in 2021 at Meta, which runs Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. But that was largely contained to the social media giant and some linked partners. The massive outage has also prompted warnings by cyber-security experts and agencies around the world about a wave of opportunistic hacking attempts linked to the IT outage. Cyber agencies in the UK and Australia are warning people to be vigilant to fake emails, calls and websites that pretend to be official. And CrowdStrike head George Kurtz encouraged users to make sure they were speaking to official representatives from the company before downloading fixes. ""We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this,"" he said in a blog post. Whenever there is a major news event, especially one linked to technology, hackers respond by tweaking their existing methods to take into account the fear and uncertainty. According to researchers at Secureworks, there has already been a sharp rise in CrowdStrike-themed domain registrations – hackers registering new websites made to look official and potentially trick IT managers or members of the public into downloading malicious software or handing over private details. Cyber security agencies around the world have urged IT responders to only use CrowdStrike's website to source information and help. The advice is mainly for IT managers who are the ones being affected by this as they try to get their organisations back online. But individuals too might be targeted, so experts are warning to be to be hyper vigilante and only act on information from the official CrowdStrike channels.",2024-07-20 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3zgznwjno,"Joe Tidy,",2024-07-20 18:08:58,
567,How bodies of frozen climbers were finally recovered from Everest 'death zone',"Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa cannot forget the dead body he saw just metres from the summit of Mount Lhotse in the Himalayas more than a decade ago. The Nepali was working as a guide for a German climber trying to scale the world’s fourth highest mountain in May 2012. The body blocking their path was thought to be Milan Sedlacek, a Czech mountaineer who’d perished just a few days earlier. Mr Sherpa was curious why the Czech climber had died so close to the top. One of the gloves on the frozen corpse was missing. “The bare hand might have slipped away from the rope,” the guide says. “He might have been killed after losing his balance and crashing onto the rock.” The body stayed where it was - and every climber scaling Mount Lhotse thereafter had to step past it. Mr Sherpa, 46, had no idea then that he would return 12 years later to retrieve the climber’s body, as part of a team of a dozen military personnel and 18 sherpas deployed by the Nepali army to clean up the high Himalayas. There have been more than 300 deaths in the Everest region since records of mountain climbing there began a century ago, and many of these bodies remain. The death toll has kept increasing: eight people have been killed so far this year; and 18 died in 2023, according to Nepal’s tourism department. The government first launched the clean-up campaign in 2019, which included removing some bodies of dead climbers. But this year was the first time that authorities set a goal to retrieve five bodies from the so-called “death zone”, above an altitude of 8,000m (26,247 feet). In the end the team - who subsisted on water, chocolate and sattu, a mixture of chickpea, barley and wheat flour - retrieved four bodies.  One skeleton and 11 tonnes of rubbish were removed at lower attitudes after a 54-day operation that ended on 5 June. “Nepal has received a bad name for the garbage and dead bodies which have polluted the Himalayas on a grave scale,” Major Aditya Karki, the leader of this year’s operation, told BBC Nepali. The campaign also aims to improve safety for the climbers.  Maj Karki says many have been startled by the sight of bodies - last year, one mountaineer could not move for half an hour after seeing a dead body on the way to Mount Everest. Many people cannot afford to retrieve the bodies of relatives who have died on mountains in Nepal. Even if they have the financial means, most private companies refuse to help get bodies from the death zone because it is too dangerous. The military allocated five million rupees ($37,400; £29,000) this year to retrieve each body. Twelve people are needed to lower a body from 8,000m, with each needing four cylinders of oxygen. One cylinder costs more than $400, meaning that $20,000 is needed for oxygen alone. Every year, there is only about a 15-day window during which climbers can ascend and descend from 8,000 metres, as the winds slow down during the transition between wind cycles. In the death zone, the wind speed often exceeds 100 km per hour. After locating the bodies, the team mostly worked after nightfall because they did not want to disturb other mountaineers. In the Everest region, which also consists of Lhotse and Nuptse, there is only one single ladder and ropeway for people climbing up and down from base camp. “It was very tough to bring back the bodies from the death zone,” Mr Sherpa says. “I vomited sour water many times. Others kept coughing and others got headaches because we spent hours and hours at very high altitude.” At 8,000m, even strong sherpas can carry only up to 25kg (55 pounds), less than 30% of their capacity at lower altitudes.  The body near the summit of Mount Lhotse, which stands at 8,516m, was discoloured after exposure to the sun and snow for 12 years. Half of the body was buried in snow, Mr Sherpa says. All four climbers’ bodies retrieved were found in the same position as they had died. Their frozen state meant their limbs could not be moved, making transportation even more difficult. Nepali law states that all bodies have to remain in the best condition before they are returned to authorities – any damage could result in penalties. The clean-up team arranged a roping system to bring the bodies down gradually, because pushing them from behind or pulling them from in front was not possible. Sometimes, the bodies became stuck in the rocky, icy terrain, and pulling them out again was a laborious task. It took 24 hours non-stop to bring the body presumed to belong to the Czech climber to the nearest camp, which is just about 3.5km away, Mr Sherpa says. The team then spent another 13 hours getting the body down to another lower camp. Next stop for the bodies was a journey to Kathmandu by helicopter, but the crew was stuck in the town of Namche for five days because of bad weather. They arrived in the capital safely on 4 June. The four bodies and the skeleton have been kept at a hospital in Kathmandu.  The army has found identification documents on two bodies – Czech climber Milan Sedlacek and American mountaineer Ronald Yearwood, who died in 2017. The Nepali government will be in communication with the respective embassies.  The process of identifying the other two bodies is ongoing. Sherpa climbers and guides keep track of the locations and possible identities of lost climbers, so they have provided potential information on some of the bodies. They believe all the bodies belong to foreigners, but the government has not confirmed this. About 100 sherpas have died on the Himalayas since records began, so many families have been waiting for years to perform the last Buddhist rites for their loved ones. Authorities have said they will bury the bodies if no one comes to claim them three months after identification – regardless of whether the bodies belong to a foreigner or a Nepali. Mr Sherpa first climbed in the Himalayas at the age of 20. In his career, he has scaled Everest three times and Lhotse five times. “Mountaineers have got famous from climbing. The Himalayas have given us so many opportunities,” he says.  “By doing this special job of retrieving dead bodies, it’s my time to pay back to the Great Himalayas.”",2024-07-20 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r31g50xqdo,"Rama Parajuli,",2024-07-19 23:08:58,
576,Why is the Bangladeshi government facing so much anger?,"Bangladesh is in turmoil. Street protests are not new to this South Asian nation of 170 million people – but the intensity of the demonstrations of the past week has been described as the worst in living memory. More than 100 people have died in the violence, with more than 50 people killed on Friday alone. The government has imposed an unprecedented communications blackout, shutting down the internet and restricting phone services. What started as peaceful protests on university campuses has now transformed into nationwide unrest. Thousands of university students have been agitating for weeks against a quota system for government jobs. A third of public sector jobs are reserved for the relatives of veterans from the country’s war for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The students are arguing that the system is discriminatory, and are asking for recruitment based on merit. Protest coordinators say police and the student wing of the governing Awami League – known as the Bangladesh Chhatra League – have been using brutal force against peaceful demonstrators, triggering widespread anger. The government denies these allegations. “It’s not students anymore, it seems that people from all walks of life have joined the protest movement,” Dr Samina Luthfa, assistant professor of sociology in the University of Dhaka, tells the BBC. The protests have been a long time coming. Though Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, experts point out that growth has not translated into jobs for university graduates. Estimates suggest that around 18 million young Bangladeshis are looking for jobs. University graduates face higher rates of unemployment than their less-educated peers. Bangladesh has become a powerhouse of ready-to-wear clothing exports. The country exports around $40 billion worth of clothes to the global market. The sector employs more than four million people, many of them women. But factory jobs are not sufficient for the aspiring younger generation. Under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, Bangladesh has transformed itself by building new roads, bridges, factories and even a metro rail in the capital Dhaka. Its per-capita income has tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years. But many say that some of that growth is only helping those close to Ms Hasina’s Awami League. Dr Luthfa says: “We are witnessing so much corruption. Especially among those close to the ruling party. Corruption has been continuing for a long time without being punished.” Social media in Bangladesh in recent months has been dominated by discussions about corruption allegations against some of Ms Hasina’s former top officials  – including a former army chief, ex-police chief, senior tax officers and state recruitment officials. Ms Hasina last week said she was taking action against corruption, and that it was a long-standing problem. During the same press conference in Dhaka, she said she had taken action against a household assistant – or peon - after he allegedly amassed $34 million. ""He can't move without a helicopter. How has he earned so much money? I took action immediately after knowing this,"" She did not identify the individual. The reaction of the Bangladeshi media was that this much money could only have been accumulated through lobbying for government contracts, corruption, or bribery. The anti-corruption commission in Bangladesh has launched an investigation into former police chief Benazir Ahmed – once seen as a close ally of Ms Hasina – for amassing millions of dollars, allegedly through illegal means. He denies the allegations. This news didn’t escape ordinary people in the country, who are struggling with the escalating cost of living. In addition to corruption allegations, many rights activists point out that space for democratic activity has shrunk over the past 15 years. “For three consecutive elections, there has been no credible free and fair polling process,” Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC. “[Ms Hasina] has perhaps underestimated the level of dissatisfaction people had about being denied the most basic democratic right to choose their own leader,” Ms Ganguly said.  The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted elections in 2014 and 2024 saying free and fair elections were not possible under Ms Hasina and that they wanted the polls to be held under a neutral caretaker administration. Ms Hasina has always rejected this demand. Rights groups also say more than 80 people, many of them government critics, have disappeared in the past 15 years, and that their families have no information on them. The government is accused of stifling dissent and the media, amid wider concerns that Sheikh Hasina has grown increasingly autocratic over the years. But ministers deny the charges. “The anger against the government and the ruling party have been accumulating for a long time,” says Dr Luthfa. “People are showing their anger now. People resort to protest if they don’t have any recourse left.” Ms Hasina’s ministers say the government has shown extreme restraint despite what they describe as provocative actions by protesters.  They say demonstrations have been infiltrated by their political opposition and by Islamist parties, who they say initiated the violence. Law Minister Anisul Huq said the government was open to discussing the issues. “The government has been reaching out to the student protesters. When there is a reasonable argument, we are willing to listen,” Mr Huq told the BBC earlier this week. The student protests are probably the biggest challenge that has faced Ms Hasina since January 2009.  How they are resolved will depend on how she handles the unrest and, most importantly, how she addresses the public's growing anger.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5xye1d285o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-20 08:08:59,
575,Anxiety at Aspen over Ukraine and Trump,"America’s national security community made its annual pilgrimage to the mountains of Aspen in Colorado this week for a gathering notable for a looming feeling of anxiety. One reason is that the world is more dangerous and contested than in previous years with war in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as tensions in Asia. But the issues discussed at the Aspen Security Forum also were overshadowed by political events that may define much of what happens next. With Donald Trump accepting the US presidential nomination during the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin and questions over whether President Biden will be forced to stand aside, there was a concern that time may be running out not just for the current administration, but for the wider approach to foreign policy, which has guided America in recent years. Allies are looking toward November's election with ''angst'' about how much they can continue to count on American leadership, Douglas Lute, a former ambassador to NATO said at the forum. Specifically, anxiety surrounded the question of whether America’s support for Ukraine would continue. November’s presidential election comes at a moment when the war may be shifting so that it will less be about major gains on the battlefield and more a test of wills between Russia and Ukraine, and its allies as to who can keep going. Trump has suggested he might push for a deal, which Ukraine and its allies fear may serve Russia’s interests more than their own. The selection of JD Vance as Trump’s running mate heightened concerns about the future of America’s commitment since Mr Vance has advocated for reducing spending on Ukraine, shifting America’s focus away from Europe, and focusing on confronting China. British officials and ministers were absent from Aspen, but officials from other European countries stressed the importance of continued US engagement with Ukraine.  “Our house is on fire in Europe. The war in Ukraine is existential,"" Jonatan Vseviov, from Estonia’s Foreign Ministry told the conference. While US military officers were wary of being drawn into politics, some sounded almost as if they were already preparing a case to make to a possible Trump administration, knowing that it likely would pressure NATO allies to increase their spending and take up a greater burden on Ukraine. General Christopher Cavoli, America’s top general in Europe, said continued US commitment to NATO was important because European partners had changed their behaviour in recent years.  ""This is a Europe that recognizes what the burden is and that it has got to be shared ... this is exactly the partner that we have been looking for for three decades,” he said.  The moderator responded that they hoped someone was livestreaming his answer to the Republican convention. There was recognition that the Republican Party’s foreign policy shift away from a more internationalist perspective went deeper than just Donald Trump.   One reason discussed at the meeting, was that the international order America built through globalisation and free trade did not always deliver benefits for American workers. That sparked domestic backlash, undermining support for continued engagement, not just in Ukraine, but more broadly.  Calls to reduce funding for Ukraine and act more unilaterally have been growing within the Republican Party. Former Republican Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said she was’ concerned’.   She made the case that, for the US, standing firm in Ukraine would send an important message to China. “I understand that a lot of people want to focus now just on China, but ….we have to keep driving home that credibility is not divisible. So what you do in Ukraine is actually going to matter to (China’s leader) Xi Jinping,” she said. That view was echoed by General CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US military.  “We have credibility at stake,” he said. “Ukraine matters. Unprovoked aggression in one part of the world does not stay in one part of the world.” But Ms Rice said she also recognised that American public opinion had changed and some previous commitments were unsustainable. “We have to realize that some of these engagements are going to be hard to sustain over a long period of time. I don't know if any American president …. can sustain 60 billion (dollar) packages to Ukraine every six months,” she said. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan closed the forum stressing that the Biden administration has put considerable effort into building alliances in Europe and Asia.  The reservoir of support for Ukraine in Congress and among the public was strong enough to survive any political headwinds, he said. Mr Sullivan also pointed out that international commitments had been secured for Ukraine to sustain support in the long term. “It’s a very good feeling,” Mr Sullivan joked when asked if it was good to be out of Washington, even as journalists pressed him on President Biden’s ability to go on for another four years in office. The Aspen foreign policy elite can feel like a bubble but in the fresh mountain air there was a sense that foreign affairs was not going to be immune from change. And whatever the result of November’s election, with a more dangerous world, the path ahead looked uncertain.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cljy57r64jlo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-19 23:08:59,
574,'I can't forgive police officers for photos of my dead girls',"This article contains some content readers may find distressing. The mother of two women who were murdered says she has forgiven their killer, but not two police officers who took photos of their bodies. Mina Smallman told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that she does not feel ""hatred"" towards the man who killed her daughters, Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, in June 2020.  But she said the Met Police officers who sent photos of their bodies to a WhatsApp group chat had ""violated"" the victims - and for that reason she has not forgiven them.  ""Obviously what they did wasn't as bad as murdering,"" Ms Smallman said. ""But you're telling me you have violated our girls, further? ""Because of that - them I haven't forgiven."" Ms Smallman, 27, and Ms Henry, 46, were stabbed to death by Danyal Hussein in June 2020.  PCs Jamie Lewis and Deniz Jaffer were deployed to guard the crime scene in Wembley, where the two sisters were found. They took pictures of their bodies, describing them as ""dead birds"" on a group chat, an offence for which they were each jailed for 33 months. Ms Smallman said that when the two men were released, she attempted suicide, an incident she describes in her book A Better Tomorrow: Life Lessons in Hope and Strength. ""I just thought: 'I don't want to be here.'  ""I've had enough. And yeah - I attempted suicide."" Ms Smallman, a campaigner for women's safety, said police needed to take the online misogynistic radicalisation of young men more seriously. ""A lot accelerated during lockdown ... [young men became exposed] to dialogues that suggest that if you can't get a girlfriend it's because women have become more dominant and men have lost their place in society.""  ""This is radicalisation that is happening to our young men, it is feeding those haters to hate even more, and giving them the tools to hurt women in their lives."" Despite how her daughters were treated by the Met Police officers, she said she still has faith in the police.  ""The majority of the police are good people.""  But she added that the Met needed reform, which was why she was ""working with"" authorities to ""ensure that we have the police force that we deserve"". Earlier this month she called for more black officers to be deployed in London, appearing at the launch of the Alliance for Police Accountability (APA), a group of bodies fighting racism and misogyny in the police. Commenting on the recent crossbow attack that killed Carol, Hannah and Louise Hunt, the wife and two of the daughters of the BBC's John Hunt, Ms Smallman said she ""grieves all over again"". ""It just takes me back to the day when I was told [my daughters] were dead. ""Now I grieve, for them, for us, and for the family. ""Their life will never be the same again."" Ms Smallman knows the mother of Sarah Everard, who was raped and murdered by a Met Police officer. ""When I talk to these mums, they are so broken, really broken. And they're grateful to me, because they know I'm talking about all of us."" If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, help and support is available at BBC Action Line.

573,Cyanide teacups in Room 502: Mystery of the Bangkok hotel deaths,"There was little to indicate what had happened on the fifth floor of the Grand Hyatt Erawan in Bangkok until police officers opened the door. No-one was heard to scream, or had rung for help. No-one had even made it to the door. Even inside, there were apparently no signs of struggle - the untouched late lunch still laid out neatly on the table for the occupants to enjoy. From outside of Room 502, the only clue to the horror inside the locked room was the fact the group were late checking out of the hotel. And yet inside were six bodies, alongside tea cups laced with cyanide. It didn't take officers long to work out the occupants of the room had drunk the poisoned tea, or to find out who the apparent victims were. But days after police revealed the grim discovery, big questions remain: why them - and who did it? Four of the victims are Vietnamese nationals - Thi Nguyen Phuong, 46, her husband Hong Pham Thanh, 49, Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, 47, and Dinh Tran Phu, 37. The other two are American citizens of Vietnamese origin - Sherine Chong, 56, and Dang Hung Van, 55. According to investigators, Chong was believed to have borrowed 10 million baht ($280,000; £215,000) from husband and wife Hong Pham Thanh and Thi Nguyen Phuong to invest in a hospital building project in Japan. The couple, who owned a construction business, had apparently tried in vain to get their money back. In fact, the matter was due to go to court in Japan in a matter of weeks. On the face of it, this meeting appeared to be an attempt to discuss the issue in advance of the case. Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan was there because Chong - who US media have said lived in Oakland, California - had asked her to act as her intermediary with the couple regarding the investment. But how were the other two linked to the case? Dinh Tran Phu - a successful make-up artist whose clientele includes movie stars, singers and beauty queens in Vietnam - was at the gathering working for Chong. His father, speaking to BBC Vietnamese, emphasised the fact he had travelled to Thailand with his regular clients, not with strangers. A close friend, meanwhile, said he knew both Thi Nguyen Phuong and Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, having introduced them to treatments at a friend's spa in Da Nang, where he lived. Dang Hung Van's participation in the hotel suite meeting was not immediately clear. Police said there was a seventh name in the hotel reservation, the sister of one of the six. That person returned to Vietnam from Thailand last week and police said she was not involved in the incident. The group checked into the hotel separately over the weekend and were assigned five rooms - four on the seventh floor, and one on the fifth. Chong checked into Room 502 on Sunday. The five others visited her in her suite that day, but they headed back to their respective rooms for the night. Before noon on Monday, Dang Hung Van ordered six cups of tea while Dinh Tran Phu, the make-up artist, ordered fried rice from their respective rooms. They asked that it be delivered to Room 502 at 14:00 local time. A few minutes before 14:00, Chong started receiving the food orders at Room 502. She was alone in the suite at that time. Police said she refused the waiter's offer to brew tea for her party. The waiter also found that she “spoke very little and was visibly under stress”. The rest of the group started arriving soon after. The couple went in lugging a suitcase. At 14:17, all six could be seen by the door before it was shut. From then on, there was no sign of movement from inside. They had been scheduled to check out on Monday but failed to do so. Police entered the room at 16:30 on Tuesday and found the six dead on the floor. The initial investigation found that two appeared to have tried get to the suite's door, but failed to reach it in time.  All the bodies bore signs of cyanide poisoning, which can - in certain doses - kill within minutes. Their lips and nails had turned dark purple indicating a lack of oxygen, while their internal organs turned ""blood red"", which is another sign of cyanide poisoning. Investigators say there is ""no other cause"" that would explain their deaths ""except for cyanide"". Further tests are being carried out to determine the ""intensity"" of the deadly chemical and to rule out any other toxins. Cyanide starves the body's cells of oxygen, which can induce heart attacks. Early symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath and vomiting. Its use in Thailand is heavily regulated and those found to have unauthorised access face up to two years in jail. Police suspect that one of the dead was behind the poisoning and was driven by crushing debt - but have not said who. According to Vietnamese outlet VN Express, investigators said Chong had been sued by all the other five over their failed investments. The meeting in Bangkok was called to negotiate a settlement, but the attempt failed. Police have sought a statement from the group's tour guide in Bangkok, 35-year-old Phan Ngoc Vu. The guide reportedly said that before she died, Thi Nguyen Phuong Lan, the mediator, had asked someone to buy traditional medicine containing snake blood for her joint pains.  Then there are the two metal beverage containers that did not belong to the hotel found by police in the suite. The containers were placed beside the cyanide-laced teacups, near the dining table. What is certain is that officials want the matter resolved quickly. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has directed officials in Hanoi to co-ordinate closely with their Thai counterparts on the investigation. As for Thai authorities, it couldn't have come at a worse time for Thailand. It had just expanded visa-free entry to 93 countries to revive its tourism industry, a key economic pillar that has yet to fully recover from the pandemic. Barely a year before, a 14-year-old boy shot dead two people at a luxury shopping mall, also in Bangkok. Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was with police on the scene at the Grand Hyatt on Tuesday night. He said there was no danger to public safety and that it was a private matter. For the families left behind, the shock is palpable. BBC Vietnamese got hold of the make-up artist's mother, Tuy, on the phone, but she was sobbing so uncontrollably that she hung up after a short conversation. She said she thought her son was just on a routine work trip. His father, Tran Dinh Dung, said in a separate interview that he did not notice anything strange with his son the last time he saw him.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e57w7jkldo,"Joel Guinto & BBC Vietnamese Service,",2024-07-19 23:08:59,
577,The African Tour de France cyclist racking up historic wins,"To his fans, he’s the “African king” - an international star and the first black African to win a Tour de France stage. Biniam Girmay did that not only once but three times this year at road cycling's premier event. Barring an accident, the 24-year-old looks set to win the green jersey on Sunday - a prize awarded to the best sprinter over the gruelling three-week competition.  But Girmay's journey to the top has been riddled with obstacles - he has battled culture shocks, Europe's visa procedures and the loneliness of being thousands of miles away from his wife and young daughter. Now, he is embracing his role as a hero in his home country - Eritrea - and an inspiration for cyclists across Africa as a whole. Many believe Girmay's success will spark change in an overwhelmingly white sport - in this year's Tour de France he is the only black rider in the whole peloton of 176 riders. Girmay - or Bini to his loved ones and fans - was born and raised in Eritrea, a small East African country with a population of around 3.7 million. Unusually, Girmay was never a champion of Asmara - the capital city he grew up in - or Eritrea. Instead, he appeared quite suddenly on the international stage after being scouted by cycling's global governing body, the UCI. Girmay told Eritrean media earlier this year that it is easier to win at the Tour de France than to be an Eritrean champion. This is because despite its tiny population, the country has a wealth of talented cyclists, many of whom have won medals in global and continental races. Cycling is one of Eritrea's most popular sports, a pastime picked up during decades of Italian colonial rule. It is a source of pride for many Eritreans, whose country usually only makes global headlines for its border conflicts and a human rights record considered to be poor by rights organisations, but fiercely defended by the government. Girmay's dreams of becoming a cyclist were sparked by his cousin, African champion Meron Teshome. The cycling obsession extends further into his family - his younger brother is now a professional rider and his father, a carpenter, used to watch the Tour de France on TV with Girmay every year. This is My Moment, a documentary charting his rise, shows an elderly female relative telling him: ""When I was young no-one could beat me, not even you!"" At 12 years old, Girmay won his first mountain bike competition and as a teenager he was selected to represent Eritrea as a junior in the African Championships. While there, he caught the eye of a UCI scout. They invited him to train at the organisation's World Cycling Centre (WCC), an elite Swiss facility that hosts young athletes from countries where there may not be so many opportunities for development. In 2018, at the age of 17, Girmay quit school and left home for Switzerland. The transition was tough, he had no friends or family nearby and was hit by a huge culture shock. ""It was tough to prepare Bini; he had to change a lot of things: his lifestyle, his routines,"" Jean-Jacques Henry, head of talent detection at the WCC, recalled as Girmay prepared for the 2023 Tour de France. ""It was too cold for him when he arrived in July. For us, it was warm. He didn't like cobblestones [which riders of Girmay's ilk often tackle] and he didn't understand tactics."" But he believed he would overcome these issues and realise his dream. He even took up English classes so he would not have to use a translator in media interviews when he eventually turned pro. Sure enough, in 2020, Girmay was scooped up by French team Delko. While training in France, he began planning his wedding with Saliem, his partner back in Eritrea. But the 2020 coronavirus outbreak scuppered his plans to return home - and also left him unable to compete in Europe as several races got cancelled. The following year, Girmay took another blow. Delko had gone bust, leaving the young cyclist without a team. He was, however, able to travel back to Asmara and marry Saliem. She later gave birth to a baby girl, but Girmay could not stick around for long as he had been signed by Belgian-based team Intermarché–Wanty. Securing a visa to continue his cycling odyssey was not easy - This Is My Moment documents the new father struggling to reach numerous visa application centres and embassies while in Asmara. Eventually, he managed to acquire a long-term visa, which he holds to this day. However, as per its requirements, Girmay has to leave Europe's Schengen zone of 29 countries every three months. He usually goes back to Asmara. In 2022, the cyclist began his history-making streak. At Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem, he became the first African to win a one-day classic race. Girmay was part of a four-rider breakaway in the last 30km and sprinted to victory with 250m to go. ""Veni... vidi... Bini!"" an ecstatic British commentator boomed as zoomed past finish line. The phrase, a play on the Latin for ""I came, I saw, I conquered"", has become somewhat of slogan among his fans and the media. As a sprinter, Girmay accelerates quickly towards the end of the race, embarking on a ferocious dash to the finish line. He is rarity - as a mountainous country Eritrea mostly produces ""climbers"", cyclists who race especially well on steep inclines. Girmay topped his Gent-Wevelgem victory with another history-making stage win at Giro d' Italia, which after the Tour de France is cycling's second biggest Grand Tour race. Celebrations were cut short when Girmay was taken to hospital - he had accidentally popped a prosecco cork in his eye on the winners' podium. He made a quick recovery, but without his wife and daughter around, he still struggled to enjoy his win. Despite this homesickness, Girmay battled on. His wife and daughter eventually moved to French city of Nice - and will be waiting for him after the Tour ends on Sunday. Also watching closely, will be cycling fans back in Eritrea.  After his third stage victory at the Tour, people spilled out onto the streets in Asmara, waving the national flag and dancing to a soundtrack of celebratory car horns. Eritrean fans often turn up to support Girmay away from home too - at the 2023 Tour de Suisse one fan told the BBC: ""He is an African king. We are proud. Eritrea is known for some bad things like war, now it is different."" Girmay also represents the wider continent, Mani Arthur, who runs the Black Cyclists Network and has competed for Ghana, told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast last week. “We don’t really see many black riders, especially from Africa, competing in the Tour de France,"" he said. ""So to see Girmay not only be competing but to also win a much coveted stage is incredible. He's proven himself to be amongst the best riders in the world."" Eritrean cycling coach Aklilu Haile, who has known Girmay for a decade, believes his success can have a big impact. ""Sometimes cycling seems like it's for white people only, but now he teaches us that cycling is for all the world,"" he said. Following the Tour de France, Girmay will take on this summer's Olympics in Paris. He hopes to win a gold medal but this is unlikely - he is the only road cyclist representing Eritrea and therefore will not have anyone to lead him out in the peleton to secure a space for his sprint. He also has high hopes for next year's World Championships in Rwanda, the country in which he was first scouted by the UCI. For many, a Girmay victory in Rwanda have huge significance.  Cycling fans from across the world would witness an African rider whizzing past a finish line on African soil, before being enveloped into a crowd flying the green, blue and yellow of the Eritrean flag.

571,Six-time world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91,"Ray Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978 Former world snooker champion Ray Reardon has died at the age of 91. The Welshman, who had previously been diagnosed with cancer, died on Friday evening, his wife Carol said. Reardon dominated snooker in the 1970s, claiming six world titles between 1970 and 1978. Nicknamed 'Dracula' because of his distinctive widow's peak hairstyle, he became a star as the game enjoyed a television boom. He won the first Pot Black series on BBC Two in 1969 and was made an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours. Reardon retired in 1991 aged 58 and later worked as a consultant for Ronnie O'Sullivan, helping him win the world title in 2004. In 2016 the trophy awarded to the winner of the Welsh Open was named the Ray Reardon Trophy in his honour. Obituary: How 'Dracula' the ex-miner became the snooker world's best Ray Reardon at 90: 'Proud for Wales, proud for myself' Welshman Mark Williams, a three-time world champion, told the World Snooker Tour: ""Ray is one of the best sportspeople ever from Wales, and the best snooker player. ""He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing. He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis.  ""Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration."" Six-time World Championship finalist Jimmy White said he was ""gutted"" at the death of his ""close friend"". He described Reardon as a ""class act"" and ""a giant of the game"", adding: ""Rest in peace mate."" Four-time world champion Mark Selby said Reardon was ""a legend"", while commentator and former player John Virgo said it was ""an honour to have known... a true great of our game"". Dennis Taylor, the 1985 world champion, said he ""had the pleasure of travelling around the world with a true gentleman"". Stuart Bingham, world champion in 2015, said it was ""one of the proudest moments receiving the Welsh Open trophy from the legend himself"" in 2017.

570,Thousands gather for Trump's first rally since shooting,"Thousands waited for hours on a hot summer day in Grand Rapids for Donald Trump's  first rally since a gunman shot him in the ear in an attempted assassination, undeterred by worries about safety. When he took the stage, after entering the arena surrounded by Secret Service agents, Trump cast the shooting as an act of sacrifice. He noted that Democrats often accuse him of being a threat to democracy. ""Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,"" he said. ""What did I do against democracy?""  Many of those at Saturday's event in the battleground state of Michigan told the BBC that the assassination attempt, which also killed an audience member and wounded two others, would not stop them from showing support for the Republican presidential nominee. Some said they came because of the shooting. Trump was not scheduled to address the crowd until 17:00 EST (22:00 BST), but people began camping out in a queue as early as the night before. By 13:00 EST, a line stretched for about three miles (4.8km) outside the 12,000-person Van Del Arena. Unlike last week's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Grand Rapids event was held indoors, allowing security officers to carefully monitor who entered and to cut off threats from outside the rally. In his speech, Trump thanked the “thousands and thousands” of people who came to see him “almost exactly” a week after the Pennsylvania assassination attempt. “I stand before you only by the grace of almighty God,” he said, repeating his belief that divine intervention saved him from being killed. Wendy and Steve Upcott of Clarkston, Michigan, were among the thousands who drove from all over the state to see him, many reassured by the increased security. The couple said their 26-year-old daughter begged them not to attend the rally two hours from home, fearing for their safety in the wake of the assassination attempt. But they felt obliged to come after the shooting last weekend. “The chances of it happening again just one week to the day later is unlikely,” said Ms Upcott. The Upcotts and many others in Grand Rapids were decked out in red Make America Great Again caps, along with cowboy hats, shirts and full outfits resembling the American flag. T-shirts with Trump's mug shot were for sale. Laura Schultz said she thought about her safety Saturday morning before she decided to come to the event with a friend. “You can’t let fear stop you,” she said. Other rally-goers, including several young adults, said the assassination attempt pushed them to attend the Michigan rally. It was the first Trump campaign event for Donald, a 24 year old from Grand Rapids who wore a shirt with the viral image of Trump pumping his fist after being shot. “This is the first event after the attempted assassination. I think it’s probably going to be the most important rally,” said Donald, who declined to share his last name. Donald said he had no fears for his own safety, because of the hundreds of police officers, including some on horseback. But others said they remained scared for Trump. “It should be a concern for most Americans that he is still not safe,” Ms Upcott said. “He needs to be very careful,” said Ms Schultz. Other supporters expressed outrage at the US Secret Service over the incident last week. The agency has faced intense scrutiny after shooter William Crooks was able to take aim at Trump in Pennsylvania by climbing onto a roof of a building near the rally stage, even after rallygoers pointed him out to police. Investigators have still yet to name a motive for the 20-year-old gunman who was later killed by Secret Service agents. Since then, the country has become more attuned to possible threats to both presidential candidates. Police in Jupiter, Florida, on Friday arrested a man for allegedly posting threats to Trump on social media, while a different man from Florida was arrested a few days earlier for allegedly threatening President Joe Biden. The Michigan indoor event space was much easier to secure, with metal detectors and military personnel sweeping the whole building, said former Secret Service agent Jason Russell, who has worked on campaign events at the Grand Rapids arena. “You’ll have a pretty, pretty significant number of agents on site,” Mr Russell said, adding that they would be able to keep Trump out of view until his entrance. This was one of several campaign stops the former president has made to the key battleground state as polls show him in a close race against Mr Biden. The rally came on the heels of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump officially accepted his party’s presidential nomination and delivered his first public address since the assassination attempt. It also marked the first time Trump appeared on the campaign trail with his vice-presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Mr Biden, meanwhile, has had to pause campaign events after testing positive for COVID-19.  He continues to resist growing calls from members of his own party to drop out of the race due to concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. Trump has for the most part stayed silent about Democrats' drama, but on Saturday he told the crowd they have a ""couple problems"".  ""They don't know who their candidate is, and neither do we,"" he said. On Saturday, the former White House physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, released a statement about his condition after having examined Trump.  The bullet created a 2 cm-wide wound on Trump's ear that extended down to the cartilage, Dr Jackson said, which is beginning to ""heal properly."" No stitches had been needed, he added. Trump's campaign also announced that it plans to hold its next rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on 24 July at the Bojangles Coliseum.

569,US woman freed after 43 years in prison for murder she didn’t commit,"A woman who served 43 years for a murder she did not commit has been released after her conviction was overturned. Sandra Hemme was 20 years old when she was found guilty of stabbing to death library worker Patricia Jeschke from St Joseph, Missouri, in November 1980. She was given a life sentence. There was no evidence that linked her to the crime other than a confession she gave under heavy sedation in a psychiatric hospital, a review into her case found. Now 64, she is believed to have served the longest known wrongful conviction of a woman in US history according to her representatives. Her legal team at the Innocence Project said they are grateful that Ms Hemme is finally reunited with her family, and they will “continue to fight” to clear her name. While she is no longer incarcerated, her case is still being reviewed.  Circuit Court Judge Ryan Horsman’s original 118-page ruling overturning her conviction came on 14 June. It said Ms Hemme’s lawyers had clear proof of her innocence, including evidence that was not given to her defence team at the time. ""This court finds that the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence,"" Judge Horsman concluded. The review found that local police ignored evidence that directly pointed to one of their own officers - Michael Holman – who later went to prison for another crime and died in 2015. Holman’s truck was seen in the area the day of the murder, his alibi could not be corroborated, and he used Patricia Jeschke’s credit card after claiming he found it in a ditch.  A pair of distinctive gold earrings identified by Ms Jeschke’s father were also found in Holman’s home. None of this was disclosed to Ms Hemme’s defence team at the time, the review said. Ms Hemme was interrogated by police several times under the influence of antipsychotic medication and a powerful sedative after being involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. She had been receiving occasional psychiatric treatment since she was 12 years old. Her responses were “monosyllabic” and she was “not totally cognisant of what was going on”, court documents showed, and at times could barely hold her head up straight and was in pain from muscle spasms – a side effect of the medications. Judge Horsman’s review noted that no forensic evidence linked Ms Hemme to the murder. She had no motive and there were no witnesses linking her to the crime. Sandra Hemme finally left prison on Friday, and the Kansas City Star reports that she will live with her sister.  After her release she was reunited with family in a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter. Her father had been hospitalised and was receiving palliative care this week. Her legal team said she was planning to visit him as soon as she can. Defence lawyer Sean O’Brien told the Star that she will still need help because she has spent most of her life in prison and was ineligible for social security.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx920kqgkx9o,"Tom McArthur,",2024-07-20 13:08:59,
568,Bella Hadid's Adidas advert dropped after Israeli criticism,"Adidas has dropped the supermodel Bella Hadid, who is half Palestinian, from an advertising campaign for retro shoes referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics. Israel had criticised the choice of Ms Hadid. It accused her of hostility to Israel and noted that 11 Israeli athletes had been killed by Palestinian attackers at the Munich Games. Adidas subsequently apologised and said it would ""revise"" its campaign. Ms Hadid has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians and earlier this year donated money to support relief efforts for the war in Gaza. BBC News has contacted Hadid's representatives for comment. The German sportswear company had chosen Hadid to promote its SL72 trainers, which were first launched to coincide with the 1972 Olympics. Adidas recently relaunched the SL72 shoes as part of a series reviving classic trainers. However images of the American model wearing the shoes prompted criticism, including on Israel's official account on X (formerly Twitter). ""Guess who the face of their campaign is? Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model,"" a post read on Thursday. It referred to the attack at the 1972 games, which happened when members of the Palestinian Black September group broke into the Olympic village. In addition to the Israeli athletes, a German police officer was also killed. Other social media users defended Ms Hadid and called for a boycott of Adidas following the move to pull the campaign. Adidas confirmed to AFP that Hadid had been removed from the campaign. In a statement provided to the news agency, the company said it would be ""revising the remainder of the campaign"" with immediate effect. ""We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologise for any upset or distress caused."" Hadid, whose father is Palestinian property tycoon Mohamed Anwar Hadid, has been vocal in her support for people affected by the war in Gaza. In an Instagram post in May, Hadid said she was ""devastated at the loss of the Palestinian people and the lack of empathy coming from the government systems worldwide"". Last month, she and her supermodel sister Gigi donated $1m (£785,000) to support Palestinian relief efforts. The conflict in Gaza began when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. More than 38,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqdwpv8vw1o,"Noor Nanji,",2024-07-20 11:08:59,

Iryna Farion caused controversy in 2023 by suggesting that “true patriots” of Ukraine should not speak Russian under any circumstances. The 60-year-old linguistic professor's killing on Friday is being investigated and police say it may have been a targeted attack. Her attacker has not been identified. Police say a power outage affected CCTV in the area. Lviv regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram that Ms Farion died in hospital after the shooting. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said “this was not a spontaneous killing” and police were looking for a motive. ""We already have several versions. The main ones, I can say, are [linked to Farion's] social and political activities and personal dislike,"" he said in a statement via the Telegram message service. ""We do not rule out that the murder has a commissioned character,"" he added. On Saturday President Volodymyr Zelensky said a major police operation was under way. ""All versions are being investigated, including the one that leads to Russia,"" he said. The hardline nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) political party Ms Farion was a member of blamed Russia directly for the killing. ""Moscow shoots in the temple for the Ukrainian language,"" it said in a statement. In 2023, Ms Farion said that true patriots of Ukraine should not speak Russian in any settings, including on the front lines, as it is the language of the aggressor country. She described Russian as ""the language of the enemy, who kills, discriminates, insults and rapes me"", and added: ""How crazy should you be to fight in the Ukrainian army and speak Russian?"" Her words provoked a strong reaction in Ukraine at the time, with people accusing her of inciting hatred based on linguistic preferences. She was dismissed from a university in western Ukraine and was investigated by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).  In May, the Lviv Court of Appeal reportedly issued a ruling reinstating her to the position.",2024-07-20 23:08:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp387p1zrgpo,"Tom McArthur,",2024-07-20 12:08:59,
578,France recalls contaminated Olympic-branded water bottles,"France has recalled a line of Olympic-branded water bottles for children, a week before the Games' opening ceremony in Paris.  The reusable bottles contain excessive levels of a chemical, Bisphenol A, says the official consumer recall agency, Rappel Conso.  The white flasks stamped with the Olympic rings and the Paris 2024 mascot, or the flame, were issued in August last year and sold until June. The authorities have urged people to return the bottles to the stores they bought them from. Bisphenol A - which has been widely used in making food containers - has been the subject of ongoing assessments about its safety to consumers.  According to France's food safety agency Anses, it is an endocrine disruptor - meaning it interferes with the body's hormones - and is believed to be linked to health issues including breast cancer and infertility. Associated with a wide array of health issues, Bisphenol A has been banned in France since 2015. Rappel Conso's website says the bottles made by the Vilac company have ""levels of Bisphenol A not in line with regulations"" on products designed for contact with foods.

579,Singer Jessie J reveals OCD and ADHD diagnosis,"Singer Jessie J has revealed she was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) three months ago. In a post on Instagram on Saturday, the Price Tag singer, 36, said it had made her ""re-think"" her whole life. She added that ADHD felt like ""a superpower as long as you look at it from the right perspective"". ADHD is a condition that affects people's behaviour. It can make sufferers seem restless, and they may have trouble concentrating and can act on impulse, according to the NHS website. OCD is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours, the NHS says. Jessie J, whose full name is Jessica Cornish, said having a baby had ""exposed"" the conditions more. Her son, Sky Safir Cornish Colman, was born last year. In her post, she said there had been moments where she felt like she couldn't discuss her conditions, but added: ""Here I am talking about it."" She wrote: ""In telling people a lot of the reaction I got was 'Yeah I mean we knew that' (which I'm sure some of you are doing right now) and of course I knew to some extent but having a baby has let's say... exposed it a lot more which was comforting in a way, as it made it feel less heavy and scary."" The British star, also known for hits such as Domino, said she knew she had been ""a little different and felt things differently"" her whole life. She added it was weird when one day, someone finally explained why.

580,Clint Eastwood's partner Christina Sandera dies,"Christina Sandera, the partner of Oscar-winning actor and director Clint Eastwood, has died at the age of 61. Eastwood, 94, confirmed her death in a statement to BBC News, adding: “Christina was a lovely, caring woman, and an important part of my life."" He added that he would ""miss her very much"". The pair are reported to have been together for ten years. Sandera's cause of death was not revealed. The legendary actor and Sandera kept their relationship under wraps. However, they were seen together in public on numerous occasions, including on the red carpets for The Mule and The 15:17 To Paris. In 2016, they were pictured attending a screening of Sully at Directors Guild Of America in Los Angeles. A year earlier, they attended a garden party fundraising event for animal rescue efforts. One of the most recognisable Hollywood stars, Eastwood is known for his action and western hero roles. His spaghetti westerns redefined the genre, while he also won fans around the world as Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. But as both actor and director he has stepped outside those roles, handling comedy and making serious biopics. In a career spanning seven decades, Eastwood has scooped up multiple Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. Eastwood's 40th film as a director, Juror No. 2, is currently in postproduction. Eastwood was previously married twice, first to model Margaret Neville Johnson, and later to TV news anchor Dina Ruiz. His relationship with Ruiz ended in divorce in 2014.",2024-07-20 23:09:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgml9ee8wvo,"Noor Nanji,",2024-07-20 16:09:00,
581,Cross-culture love story explores secret LGBTQ+ world,"A love story between a white, heterosexual, working-class mechanic and a South Asian Muslim drag queen is shining a light on an underground LGBTQ+ subculture. Feature film Unicorns takes the viewer to the heart of the highly secretive so-called ""gaysian"" scene - an amalgamation of the words gay and Asian - and introduces its glamorous drag queens.  ""A lot of the queens are closeted and only have a certain number of hours on a weekend where they can actually be themselves, a lot use pseudonyms and have been ostracised from their families,"" said Sally El Hosaini who co-directed the film with her partner James Krishna Floyd. ""On the surface [the gaysian scene is] extremely bright, very attractive... but underneath it's actually a very gritty, real and quite a hardcore world,"" added Floyd. ""They're a minority within a minority... they're getting attacked and rejected from all sides, from mainstream culture, from South Asian communities for the most part, from their religious communities for the most part and from the mainstream LGBTQ+ community as well."" Floyd, who also wrote the screenplay, said he and El Hosaini - who is half Welsh and half Egyptian - were keen to explore ""fluid identities"". ""For me personally as a half Indian, half English guy who has had sexually fluid experiences... mainstream culture is always putting all of us in very neat little boxes,"" he said.  ""I find that very frustrating and just so limiting."" He said he had ""always known about the gaysian scene"" but was properly introduced to it by his friend Asifa Lahore, who in 2014 became the UK’s first Muslim drag queen to speak publicly about her work.  Lahore is a producer on the film.  ""Everything in the film is based on either Asifa's experiences, my own experiences or South Asian drag queens that I now know very well - it all comes from reality,"" said Floyd.  Ashiq (played by Jason Patel) works in a shop by day but at night transforms into drag queen Aysha, dancing for a largely South Asian LGBTQ+ audience.  The love story begins when single father and mechanic Luke (played by Bohemian Rhapsody and former EastEnders actor Ben Hardy) mistakenly happens upon an underground club where Aysha is performing  and they share a kiss before he realises she is a drag queen. Patel, who plays Aysha, is not a real-life drag queen but many of the supporting cast are.  After a casting shout-out on social media El Hosaini and Floyd were sent audition tapes by a number of South Asian drag queens. ""A lot of those tapes were very moving,"" said El Hosaini.  ""Some of them were saying things like 'I don't even care if I get this role... the fact that this is being made about this kind of character and exists has made me feel seen',"" she said. ""Someone had recorded their tape in a bathroom and were talking very quietly because their family were in the house and and they didn't want to be overheard."" ""It was another moment of just reminding us why we're making this film,"" added Floyd. ""If we were making this film for anyone, it was for the gaysian community... because there hasn't been a film about them, certainly not a fictional feature film."" Floyd and El Hosaini, who live in London and have a son together, first met when Floyd starred in El Hosaini's directorial debut feature film My Brother the Devil. He starred again in her second feature film The Swimmers. Unicorns is Floyd's directorial debut and the pair's third time working together. What is it like making a film with your partner?  ""We first met in work, so we had that creative connection before our relationship,"" said El Hosaini.  ""When you do what we do and you're so involved, we are each other's rocks and support."" She said with Floyd beginning work on Unicorns nine years ago, the project was ""as old as our son, so actually it was like a child that had grown up in our family"".  ""Us coming together to make it together just felt organic and felt like the right thing to do,"" she added. El Hosaini, whose mother is Welsh and father is Egyptian, was born in Swansea, raised in Cairo and returned to Wales at 16 to study at UWC Atlantic College in the Vale of Glamorgan.  Unicorns was supported by Ffilm Cymru Wales and will have a special screening at Green Man Festival in Powys next month.  ""The industry has often seen my Egyptian side and seen me as Arab so I've been sent a lot of projects that always have an Arab angle,"" said El Hosaini. ""But I'm equally as Welsh as I am Arab, it's definitely in my bones, my blood and part of me and I think it's just time until I do my Welsh projects."" Floyd said they were both frustrated by the narrow range of stories that make it to cinema and wanted to correct that. ""This industry is not very kind to minorities and it certainly isn't kind to minorities within minorities,"" he said. ""There's such an imbalance. How many films do we need to make about - and I can say this as a half-white man - privileged, white, middle-class, cis, heteronormative men? Do we need any more of those? No, we don't."" He said one of the great things about storytelling was it could ""shine a bit of a light on those communities that we don't really hear about"". ""There’s more that connects us than divides us,"" added El Hosaini Unicorns is in UK and Irish cinemas now.",2024-07-20 23:09:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngwqv0plyo,"Nicola Bryan,",2024-07-20 06:09:00,
586,UK MP criticised for 'abominable' behaviour in Commons,"Conservative MP Victoria Atkins has been criticised for her behaviour during a parliamentary debate as she attempted to loudly interrupt another MP. A video of the incident on Friday shows the shadow health and social care secretary standing at the despatch box and speaking over Labour's Steve Reed, while deputy speaker Christopher Chope calls for order. Mr Chope then tells the chamber: ""The right honourable lady has behaved abominably."" Labour MP Perran Moon said Ms Atkins' behaviour was ""an absolute disgrace"" and called for appropriate action to be taken. Ms Atkins' office said she was ""trying to get answers"" during the debate. Lib Dem MP Helen Morgan, who was in the room during the row, spoke of the incident in a post on X. ""I witnessed this first-hand. The Conservatives proved the electorate got it right: they are not fit for government"", she said. Josh Fenton-Glynn, Labour MP for Calder Valley, also posted: ""I think the fact you don’t get to speak as much in opposition is hard for them [Conservatives] to get used to"". The incident happened as Environment Secretary Steve Reed spoke during the planning, green belt and rural affairs debate in the Commons. A spokesperson for Ms Atkins' office said: “Conservative MPs were trying to get answers about their budgets for farming, flood defences and food security, which the minister ignored. “She will always stand up fearlessly for farmers and our rural area in Westminster, even if that means a rare admonishment from the Chair.” Closing the debate shortly after the brief row, Mr Reed, Labour MP for Streatham and Croydon North, said: ""I thank all members who have taken part in this constructive and insightful debate for their perceptive contributions and their dedication to making progress on important matters.  ""After 14 years of chaos, there is once again hope for our environment, hope for our countryside, and hope for our rural communities.""

585,How China swerved worst of global tech meltdown,"While most of the world was grappling with the blue screen of death on Friday, one country that managed to escape largely unscathed was China. The reason is actually quite simple: CrowdStrike is hardly used there.  Very few organisations will buy software from an American firm that, in the past, has been vocal about the cyber-security threat posed by Beijing. Additionally, China is not as reliant on Microsoft as the rest of the world. Domestic companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei are the dominant cloud providers. So reports of outages in China, when they did come, were mainly at foreign firms or organisations. On Chinese social media sites, for example, some users complained they were not able to check into international chain hotels such as Sheraton, Marriott and Hyatt in Chinese cities. Over recent years, government organisations, businesses and infrastructure operators have increasingly been replacing foreign IT systems with domestic ones. Some analysts like to call this parallel network the ""splinternet"". ""It's a testament to China's strategic handling of foreign tech operations,"" says Josh Kennedy White, a cybersecurity expert based in Singapore. ""Microsoft operates in China through a local partner, 21Vianet, which manages its services independently of its global infrastructure. This setup insulates China’s essential services - like banking and aviation - from global disruptions."" Beijing sees avoiding reliance on foreign systems as a way of shoring up national security. It is similar to the way some Western countries banned Chinese tech firm Huawei’s technology in 2019 - or the UK's move to ban the use of Chinese-owned TikTok on government devices in 2023. Since then, the US has launched a concerted effort to ban sales of advanced semiconductor chip tech to China, as well as attempts to stop American companies from investing in Chinese technology. The US government says all of these restrictions are on national security grounds. An editorial published on Saturday in the state-run Global Times newspaper made a thinly veiled reference to these curbs on Chinese technology. ""Some countries constantly talk about security, generalise the concept of security, but ignore the real security, this is ironic,"" the editorial said. The argument here is that the US tries to dictate the terms of who can use global technology and how it is used, yet one of its own companies has caused global chaos through lack of care. The Global Times also took a jab at the internet giants who ""monopolise"" the industry: ""Relying solely on top companies to lead network security efforts, as some countries advocate, may hinder not just the inclusive sharing of governance outcomes but also introduce new security risks."" The reference to “sharing” is probably an allusion to the debate over intellectual property insofar as China is often accused of copying or stealing western technology. Beijing insists this is not the case and advocates for an open global technology marketplace - while still keeping tight control over its domestic scene. Not everything was totally unaffected in China, however. A small numbers of workers expressed thanks to an American software giant for ending their working week early.   “Thank you Microsoft for an early vacation,” was trending on the social media site Weibo on Friday, with users posting pictures of blue error screens.",2024-07-20 23:09:01,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g01y047pdo,"Nick Marsh,",2024-07-20 15:09:01,
584,"Boat fire off Haiti kills at least 40 migrants, UN says","At least 40 migrants have died after the boat they were travelling in caught fire off the northern coast of Haiti, a United Nations agency says.  The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says 41 others were rescued by the Haitian Coast Guard. The vessel was travelling from Cap-Haitien to the Turks and Caicos Islands, more than 220km (137 miles) away, the IOM said. The exact cause of the fire is not yet clear, but a local official told Reuters that people on the boat were lighting candles in a ritual to ask for safe passage, leading gasoline-filled drums to catch fire. The injured are receiving care provided by the IOM, and 11 of them were taken to the nearest hospital, the agency said. Tens of thousands of people flee Haiti every year, escaping poverty, lawlessness and gang violence at home. Rival armed groups took control of the capital, Port-au-Prince, earlier this year, forcing Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign weeks later. Grégoire Goodstein, IOM’s chief of mission in Haiti, said: “This devastating event highlights the risks faced by children, women and men migrating through irregular routes - demonstrating the crucial need for safe and legal pathways for migration. ""Haiti’s socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more.” The lack of economic opportunities, a collapsing health system and school closures are pushing many to consider migration as the only way to survive, the IOM says.  Gang violence on average killed or injured more than one person per hour in the first three months of this year, according to UN data. More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighbouring countries this year, despite the rising violence, according to the IOM. The Caribbean nation has seen an escalation of violence following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse three years ago.

582,"England have to 'kick on', says Woakes","This video can not be played Highlights: England lead West Indies by 207 England have to “kick on” from their strong end to the third day in order to take control of the second Test against West Indies, according to Chris Woakes. Joe Root and Harry Brook shared an unbroken partnership of 108 in testing conditions late on Saturday to leave the hosts 248-3, 207 ahead. “I never like to say we’re in front in a Test, because half an hour can go against us and we’re behind the game again,” said all-rounder Woakes. “The fourth morning will be huge. If that partnership is extended to 150 or 200 then we’re taking the game away. If West Indies take quick wickets they will feel ahead again.” England are favourites to win the match and the series after a fluctuating third day, with West Indies continuing their impressive response from a heavy defeat in the first Test at Lord’s. The tourists were bowled out for 457, their highest total in England for 29 years, to take a first-innings lead of 41. Though Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope swiftly put England ahead, they fell in successive Alzarri Joseph overs before Brook’s 71 not out and Root’s unbeaten 37 put England back in the ascendancy. The pitch remains true, the outfield fast and boundaries short. In the last men’s Test played on this ground, two years ago, England pulled off a stunning chase of 299 in only 50 overs to defeat New Zealand, the birth of their ‘Bazball’ style. “We have to kick on again on Sunday to take the game away from West Indies,” said Woakes, playing in his 50th Test. “Naturally, we want as many runs as possible and there’s still two days to play. “We want to be bowling at them as much as possible on day five, when the pitch could wear a little. Sunday is a big day for us, to build the lead up to 250 and 300, then hopefully we can make it really big.” Root and Brook build England lead over West Indies Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: England edge ahead in second Test This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Harry Brook's half-century England enjoyed the better of the early stages on Saturday after West Indies resumed on 351-5, still 65 behind on first innings. Woakes claimed three wickets in a 10-over spell and England took 4-31 overall to leave West Indies 386-9, 30 adrift. From there, England employed curious tactics. Ben Stokes’ side dropped the field to Joshua da Silva, who had 44, in the hope of exposing number 11 Shamar Joseph. With Da Silva hammering three sixes and Joseph two of his own, the last-wicket pair added 71 until Joseph was eventually out for 33, leaving Da Silva stranded on 82. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said the England plan was “questionable” and gave West Indies “a huge chance”. But Woakes, who ended with figures of 4-84, said: “It’s a period that can cause problems. You just have to commit to the plan you’re going with. It’s not always going to be perfect. “When the field goes out, as a bowler it’s easy to think you’re not trying to get the set batter out and just think of the number 11. At the same time, you don’t want to give away easy boundaries. “You don’t always expect the number 11 to hit a couple into the stands. Fair play to them, they played it pretty well.

Horschel, playing in the worst of the conditions, somehow fashioned a two-under-par 69 to improve to four under. Rose and Brown are among six players, including US PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, on three under,  South African Thriston Lawrence and Americans Sam Burns and Russell Henley are also one off the lead, having made their scores before the rain set in. Lawrence played the front nine in six under par as the high winds of the opening two days abated. He signed for a 65, as did Burns, while Henley shot a 66. World number one Scottie Scheffler is at two under after a 71. ""It turned into an absolute survival test,"" said Rose, who along with Brown is looking to become the first Englishman since Sir Nick Faldo in 1992 to win the Claret Jug. ""I did a good job of surviving. I'm delighted to look at that leaderboard and say I'm one back."" Horschel, who was playing with Rose, summed up the brutal conditions on the closing stretch, where the wind had turned from the opening two days from helping to hindering, by saying ""we played five par-fives on the back side, not including the par-five 16th"". He had four birdies in his opening nine holes to get to six under and then hung on over the back nine. ""This is by far my best round in really tough conditions in an Open Championship,"" he added. ""I enjoy hitting little bunt shots. I get tired of golf where you're making full swings and you lean into a certain number and it stops.  ""I like when you have to be creative and find a way to get around the golf course."" Ireland's Shane Lowry, who led on seven under after two rounds, collapsed to a six-over 77, his troubles starting with a double-bogey five on the notoriously difficult Postage Stamp eighth. He then had five bogeys on the back nine, his final one coming after he hit his second shot into the grandstand down the right of the 18th.  But at one under par and with more rain forecast to disrupt the final round, the 2019 champion is still in contention.

""I felt like it was good energy from the crowd, but with everyone with umbrellas up, no one is clapping; everyone is more shouting and cheering, wanting high fives.  ""I normally engage in that type of stuff; today I just had my head down. I was not interested in anything. I was just trying to get around the golf course and hang in there. ""So to be able to go and have a moment on 18 where I could just let it out a little bit, just to show that I am super-excited about the support, was big because until that point I was just grinding."" World number 272 Brown has defied odds and expectation since leading on day one. And he looked poised to lead into the final round when he birdied the par-five 16th to get to six under. However, the 2016 English Amateur champion bogeyed the par-three 17th after finding a bunker off the tee and then hit a six at the par-four last to drop from leader by one, to in the chasing pack. ""It was a bit of a sting on the last two holes through not really hitting a bad golf shot,"" he said.  ""Links golf got the better of me but we're still there. ""I'm a little bit disappointed because I did so well so get to where I got to, and it's a bit nasty to finish like that. ""But if you'd have told me I was going to go into the final round of the Open one or two shots back, I would have ripped your hand off.""

Discussing the 238-yard 17th, and then the 502-yard 15th, he added: ""I probably don't hit a three-wood on a par-three very often.

Ten Hag, 54, was appointed manager in 2022 after Rangnick's seven months in charge. The German, now in charge of Austria, guided United to sixth in the Premier League but won just 11 of his 29 matches. Rangnick concluded that the club required ""open-heart"" surgery and their troubles could not be solved through ""minor changes"".  Ten Hag, who signed a one-year contract extension this month, says Rangnick's analysis was correct.  ""Rangnick was absolutely right,"" Ten Hag said in an interview with Dutch newspaper AD Sportwereld., external ""We have been working very hard on this for two years, but he said it exactly right: it is a thorough, very complex operation. And I knew when I started that it was going to be a tough job."" United have undergone major changes off the pitch since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7% stake in the club last December. Omar Berrada, Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell have all joined in positions at board level this year, while the club have committed £50m to improving the training ground.  Forward Joshua Zirkzee and defender Leny Yoro have joined from Bologna and Lille respectively in the past week, while Ten Hag has confirmed interest in Bayern Munich and Netherlands centre-back Matthijs de Ligt.  ""It remains to be seen whether De Ligt will come,"" said Ten Hag. ""Of course I know Matthijs well, I'm not going to deny that. I wanted to sign him two years ago, but he had already gone a long way with Bayern Munich."" Despite working with De Ligt at former club Ajax, Ten Hag says it was United's scouting department that suggested the centre-back as a transfer target.  Ten Hag also confirmed that forward Jadon Sancho, who last appeared for the club in August 2023 and spent the second half of last season on loan at Dortmund after falling out with the manager, is available again for selection.   ""Everyone can make a mistake,"" said Ten Hag. Sancho and Yoro both started as goals from Amad Diallo and Joe Hugill saw United beat Rangers 2-0 at Murrayfield in a friendly on Saturday.

Not many would even have predicted it at the start of Saturday's sodden third round. But here we are. At 14:25 BST at Royal Troon, the world numbers 62 and 98 will set off on the links for 18 holes that could change their lives. Horschel spoke on Friday about how you can ""submit your legacy"" by winning a major. About how you don't need to play ""perfect golf"" to win one. The 37-year-old was not perfect on Saturday, but he was not far off in a splendid 69. Just two back-nine bogeys spoiled his card on a day when others defaced theirs.

""That's what I'm going to do again tonight, and hopefully that comes true."" By the time Horschel was towelling himself down, Lawrence was long up the road and enjoying his evening.  Maybe he watched his Sunday partner come down the brutal stretch. Maybe not. But the way he was talking post-round, it was just going to be another day. ""The gameplan doesn't change and the mentality doesn't change,"" the 27-year-old South African said. ""Hopefully I'm in with a couple of shots, but I'm going to just try to do the same thing, be aggressive and try and win a tournament.""

But he rejected suggestions that it was important to lay down a marker after challenging for wins in Imola, Canada, Spain, Austria and the UK but just missing out. The Briton said: “Every single qualifying is important and every single race is important. It’s not all of a sudden I need to do it and prove my point - I don’t. “We have done the best we could in every race. We have shown great pace and opportunities. “I know we have missed out on some and we don’t need to go back into all that stuff.” Norris said before the race weekend that McLaren had “definitely been the most consistent team” since introducing a big upgrade package in Miami, but “I don’t think we’ve had a dominant weekend”. So far, Hungary is the closest they have come. Norris was fastest in Friday practice and in the final session on Saturday before qualifying, and again in the second session of a difficult wet-dry qualifying period before taking pole. Norris managed to take pole despite only having one one set of new tyres for the final session while his rivals had two. Norris was 0.328 seconds quicker than Verstappen. But after Piastri and Verstappen had used their second set of new tyres, Piastri closed to within 0.022secs and Verstappen 0.046secs. It was McLaren's first one-two on the grid since the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix, when Lewis Hamilton led Jenson Button. The last time McLaren locked out the front row Red Bull were also third - Mark Webber here with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button at the 2012 Brazilian GP Norris said he was expecting a close race on Sunday. “It would be nice to have a nice Turn One and see what happens from there, but I am not expecting it,” he said. “I am expecting a difficult race with Oscar and Max behind. “Every one is important. Every time, we try to maximise every place, every point and the more we can try and get back on Max, and the more the team can get on Red Bull in the constructors’ [championship] the better. “[There is] no point or emphasis on trying to beat a particular someone or something. It’s just go out and do what we do because we’re doing a good job.” He said he believed Red Bull were “as quick” as McLaren, and pointed out that they had shown the best race pace in Friday practice, when conditions were more akin to the hotter weather that is expected to return for the race. “They’ll still be challenging us a lot.” Piastri said he was aware that places could change at the first corner because it is a long run to Turn One from the start, which gives drivers a chance to use the slipstream to their advantage. But Norris said McLaren would discuss how best to maximise their position at the start of the race. Twelve years later, and McLaren are back locking out the front row. Piastri may like to know Button won in 2012 from second on the grid. Verstappen has a comfortable 84-point championship lead over Norris with half the season still remaining, while Red Bull look more vulnerable in the constructors’ championship, for which both cars score points. Their lead has been coming down and is 71 over Ferrari and 78 over McLaren. Verstappen made clear his concerns over his team’s performance by pointing out that they had not managed to return to being the fastest car despite what he had described on Thursday as their biggest upgrade package of the season. “For sure [the upgrades] work, but we are still not first, right?” Verstappen said. “So we need more. It’s as simple as that. “I was happy with the laps but balance-wise everything was a bit on the edge. I’m pushing as hard as I can and then you have little moments here and there. It just means we are a bit slower so we have work to do. “We are pushing as hard as we can but clearly at the moment it is still not how we want it to be. “We will continue to do so and try to find more performance but I am also well aware that is not so easy to find with things already planned and the way the car is. “There are many races and things can happen with conditions and we just need to stay focused and do the best we can every single time and optimise our performances.” Norris on Hungary pole in McLaren front-row lockout Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions How to follow Hungarian GP on the BBC Mercedes’ chances of becoming the first team this year to win three races in a row look distant. After victories for George Russell in Austria and Lewis Hamilton in Britain,  Hamilton is their highest driver on the grid in fifth place, sandwiched between the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc. Team-mate George Russell is 17th after he and the team fumbled the mixed conditions in the first session. “We’re definitely not quickest,” Hamilton said. “In the cooler conditions, we’re looking good but warmer it’s not the case. “The McLarens and Red Bull will be quicker in the race. We are there or thereabouts with the Ferraris, so I think we will have a battle with those guys.” Leclerc admitted that he was “disappointed” because Ferrari, who have an upgraded floor this weekend, had “lost a little bit our performance” from earlier in the season. “We have had a more consistent and smooth weekend but the performance is lacking.”",2024-07-20 23:09:02,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cg64e74l3g2o,Andrew Benson,2024-07-20 19:09:02,
590,Root and Brook build England lead over West Indies,"This video can not be played Highlights: England lead West Indies by 207 Second Rothesay Test (day three of five), Trent Bridge England 416 (Pope 121; A Joseph 3-98) & 248-3 (Duckett 76, Brook 71*) West Indies 457 (Hodge 120, Athanaze 82, Da Silva 82*; Woakes 4-84) England lead by 207 runs Scorecard England recovered from a chaotic morning to build a healthy lead over West Indies on the third day of the second Test at Trent Bridge. The hosts ended the day on 248-3, taken to an advantage of 207 runs by a classy unbroken partnership of 108 between Joe Root and Harry Brook. England ended the day on top, yet were anything but when Joshua da Silva and Shamar Joseph were adding 71 for the last West Indies wicket. Efficient with the second new ball, England reduced the tourists to 386-9, still 30 behind, only for Ben Stokes’ side to employ some baffling tactics and surrender the initiative. England spread the field for Da Silva in the hope of exposing Joseph and instead released the pressure. Da Silva clobbered three sixes and Joseph two of his own, one that showered spectators with broken roof tiles. When Joseph was finally out for 33, Da Silva was stranded on 82 not out and West Indies had reached 457, their largest total in this country since 1995. England’s deficit of 41 was wiped out by 76 from Ben Duckett and 51 by Ollie Pope, only for the match to swing again when both were dismissed in the space of eight Alzarri Joseph deliveries. But Brook moved to 71 not out and Root an unbeaten 37 to leave England favourites to win the Test and the series. England have to 'kick on', says Woakes Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: England edge ahead in second Test This video can not be played Watch Ben Duckett's best shots from his half-century This was another engrossing day in a fabulous Test, one that could yet produce a grandstand finish. That England are not already out of sight is down to their own failings. They should have got more runs in the first innings, dropped Kavem Hodge in his 120, then took leave of their tactical senses during the partnership between Da Silva and Shamar Joseph. West Indies deserve enormous credit for their response to being hammered in the first Test and their fighting spirit was again on display as they scrapped a first-innings lead and pegged back England when Duckett and Pope were in full flow. The tension was palpable as Root and Brook rebuilt in challenging conditions late in the day, the umpires at one stage in discussion over the light. The pitch, a contributing factor in the quality of the contest, remains good for batting and seems unlikely to provide any concerns for West Indies in their eventual run chase. England are on course for a match-winning position and West Indies will have too much to do if they cannot take early wickets on Sunday. Still, there remains enough doubt over the eventual outcome. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Harry Brook's half-century Behind on the scoreboard and in terms of momentum after the shambolic end to the West Indies innings, England suffered a further setback when the fingertips of Jayden Seales accounted for Zak Crawley, who followed a duck on Thursday with being run-out backing up. Duckett and Pope counter-punched to ensure England were level after 41 balls. Pope played perfect cover drives, Duckett punished any miniscule amount of width and swept off-spinner Kevin Sinclair for three successive fours. The second-wicket partnership added 119. Crucially, the ball was changed on 25 overs and Alzarri Joseph got the replacement to move in the air. The next delivery, Pope gave a thick edge to gully and, in Joseph’s following over, Duckett was trapped by an in-swinging yorker. The sky was dark, the floodlights on and England’s lead 99 when Brook joined his Yorkshire team-mate Root. Brook started assertively, clubbing Jason Holder down the ground for four, then gradually tailored his tempo to the situation. Root was measured, as two men who played awful shots in the first innings dug in for their team. The ball went past the bat regularly, England hung in. Brook’s handsome drive off Alzarri Joseph took him to 50 and, by the end, the hint of blue sky was symbolic of England’s progress. This video can not be played Woakes takes two wickets in two balls West Indies reached 351-5 on a long second day in the dirt for England, who returned refreshed on Saturday morning and were excellent for much of the first session. As four wickets fell for 31 runs, Chris Woakes claimed 3-25 including two in two balls in a 10-over spell, while Gus Atkinson had Sinclair well held by gully Brook, increasingly showing himself to be England’s best fielder. But when last man Shamar Joseph joined Da Silva, at that point on 44, England inexplicably lost the plot. The field was spread for Da Silva in the hope of keeping the established batter quiet and exposing Joseph to more of the strike. It is a defensive tactic at odds with England’s positive philosophy, has failed previous England captains and did not work again here. Da Silva played an extraordinary loft over the off side for six off Mark Wood, fit to bowl after suffering cramp on Friday, and top-edged the same bowler for another maximum. Joseph grew in confidence and pulled Atkinson for successive sixes, including one that shattered the roof tiles in the Larwood and Voce Stand. West Indies moved ahead, Root was asked to bowl some off-spin dross into the pads of Da Silva, who swept three fours and hit a six over long-on. Stokes did not bowl, England were bereft and Da Silva eyed a hundred. Joseph, though, got carried away and miscued Wood to mid-on, ending West Indies’ fun.

591,Nadal into first final since 2022 at Swedish Open,"Rafael Nadal has won 22 Grand Slam titles Rafael Nadal reached his first final since 2022 as he beat Duje Ajdukovic in three sets at the Swedish Open in Bastad. Nadal beat unseeded Croat Ajdukovic 3-6 6-4 6-4 in two hours and 12 minutes to reach his first showpiece since the French Open two years ago. On Sunday, the 38-year-old Spaniard will face seventh seed Nuno Borges, of Portugal, who beat unseeded Thiago Agustin Tirante, of Argentina, 6-4 6-3 in their semi-final. ""It was a very tough match - my opponent has one of the best backhands I have played against,"" said Nadal. ""He came here with a lot of confidence. I was trying to push him back and it was very difficult. I found a way to survive."" The final will be Nadal's 131st tour final, and 72nd on clay. ""It is always a good feeling to get back into a final,"" he added. ""I'm still in this process of recovering a lot of things that I lost because I had an important hip surgery almost a year ago. Things are not going that easy but I am fighting."" Nadal was also set to play in the Swedish Open men's doubles semi-final on Saturday with Casper Ruud, but the pair pulled out with Nadal conserving his energy for the singles final. Their withdrawal sends Brazil's Orlando Luz and Rafael Matos into the final. Nadal was competing in the doubles as preparation for his doubles partnership with Carlos Alcaraz at the Paris Olympics this summer. The Croat took the first set 6-4 but Nadal hit back with a strong performance in the second to win it 6-3. In the third Nadal started well with a double break to race to a 3-0 lead. But in the fourth game Ajdukovic had two break points on Nadal's serve and broke at the second time of asking. The break sparked a fire in Ajdukovic, who held and then broke again to level the third set 3-3. Nadal was the next to break in a close encounter and celebrated wildly when he saved multiple break points to hold and lead 5-3. Ajdukovic served to stay in the match and held, before Nadal did the same to claim victory. Across the match Nadal had six break points, winning each one. Ajdukovic, meanwhile, had 10 break points but could only convert five.

600,"Biden drops out, upending race for White House","US President Joe Biden has ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic candidate, in an extraordinary decision that upends an already dramatic race for the White House. Mr Biden, 81, said in a Sunday written statement that it was the ""greatest honour"" to serve but his withdrawal was ""in the best interest of my party and the country"".  Mr Biden had faced intense pressure to step down over concerns about his age and mental fitness. Mr Biden insists he will remain as president until January. Ms Harris, 59, said that she was ""honoured"" to be endorsed, adding she would ""earn and win this nomination"" and unite the country against Donald Trump. ""We have 107 days until election day,"" she said. ""Together, we will fight. And together, we will win."" However, several other senior Democrats are also being touted as replacements, and a choice must be made at the party's national convention in Chicago in August. If the party struggles to unify around Ms Harris, the battle to succeed Mr Biden could play out on the convention floor. Mr Biden's announcement caps a tumultuous period in US politics, which began with his sometimes incoherent debate performance against Trump on 27 June, fuelling concerns over his age and capacity to win re-election. As Democratic donors and dozens of politicians called on Mr Biden to step aside, a resurgent Trump pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt. Trump said on Sunday that the president ""was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve"". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately.  Party sources told the BBC that White House staff were told only moments before the statement was released on Sunday afternoon, although Mr Biden had spoken to Ms Harris. Dozens of senior Democrats and party grandees including Barack Obama, the former president, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately praised the decision and lauded Mr Biden's accomplishments in office. However, not all have openly accepted Mr Biden's endorsement of Ms Harris. Mr Obama stated that he had ""extraordinary confidence"" that an ""outstanding nominee emerges"" but did not explicitly back Ms Harris. Ms Pelosi has not commented. Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an ""open process"" to nominate Harris. Former president Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton said they backed her as a candidate, saying they would ""fight with everything we've got to elect her"". Several of those who could challenge for the nomination also praised Mr Biden - but stopped short of commenting on his endorsement of his vice-president. Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, stated that her job ""will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump.""  Gavin Newsom, California's governor, praised Mr Biden as a ""selfless"" president, but stopped short of further comment on who would succeed him. Pete Buttigieg, the current transport secretary, said Mr Biden had ""earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history"". He too did not address the next step for the party. The Democratic National Committee meanwhile filed to amend the names of its fundraising committees to the Harris Victory Fund and Harris Action Fund. Meanwhile two major Democratic donors - LinkedIn co-funder Reid Hoffman and investor Alexander Soros - publicly endorsed Harris. Mr Hoffman said on X/Twitter that when ""presented with the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, I believe in the American people to make the right decision for our country"". But within an hour of Mr Biden's announcement, the pro-Trump super-PAC campaign fund Make America Great Again posted an advert attacking Mr Harris, claiming ""she covered up Joe's obvious mental decline"". Donald Trump added: ""Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same."" Mr Biden had faced intense scrutiny since his debate performance in June. Less than two weeks ago, he hosted a high-profile summit with Nato leaders in Washington. The occasion did little to calm nerves within his own party, with him mistakenly introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin”, and appearing to refer Ms Harris as ""Vice President Trump"".  At one point he told an interview that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could make him withdraw, but then later said he would consider withdrawing if he had a health condition. On Friday, while in isolation after testing positive for Covid, he pledged to return to the campaign trail in the coming week. In his statement on Sunday, Mr Biden thanked his Ms Harris, saying she was an ""extraordinary partner"".  ""And let me express my heartfelt appreciation for the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me,"" his statement added. ""I believe today and always have: that there is nothing America can’t do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.""  Officials from the Democratic National Committee held an emergency meeting on Sunday evening. The focus will now be on the party's national convention, which is scheduled to start on 19 August.  Mr Biden swept the party's primaries, meaning that the delegates representing each state at the convention were pledged to vote for him - although they are now expected to be released to vote for another candidate.

599,"What Biden quitting means for Harris, the Democrats and Trump","Joe Biden has turned the US election on its head. After fiercely insisting for weeks that he would remain the Democratic nominee for president, he has bowed to pressure and dropped out of the race. Here's what it means for Vice-President Kamala Harris, for the Democrats more broadly and for Donald Trump.  The prospects for Kamala Harris being the Democratic nominee have received a big boost with Joe Biden’s endorsement. He gave her his full backing, calling his decision to make her vice-president four years ago the best he ever made.   She responded by saying she was honoured to have his endorsement and would do everything possible to win the nomination. It is possible that most Democrats will follow the president’s lead and fall in line behind the vice-president to avoid ongoing uncertainty less than a month from the Democratic convention. There are practical and political reasons for doing so.  She is next in the constitutional line of succession. The optics of passing over the first black woman on a presidential ticket would be terrible for the party. She would also immediately have access to the roughly $100 million in funds the campaign has raised so far. But there are also risks. Public opinion surveys show Harris’ approval ratings are about as low as his. And in head-to-head matchups against Donald Trump, she fares roughly the same as Biden.  Second is that Harris has had a sometimes rocky time as vice-president. Early in the administration, she was given the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border.  That’s a daunting challenge, and a number of missteps and misstatements opened her up to criticism. She’s also been the administration’s point person on abortion rights, which has been a topic she has much more effectively handled. But those first impressions have stuck. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Harris has already run for national office - her 2020 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination - and stumbled badly. While she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primaries. Opting for Harris is a risk for Democrats, but at this point there are no safe options. And the stakes – a possible Donald Trump victory – are as high as they get. Over the past half-century, political conventions have been transformed into somewhat boring affairs. With every minute carefully scripted for television, they’ve become extended multi-day commercials for the presidential nominee. Last week’s Republican convention was certainly that way - even with Donald Trump’s overly long, sometimes rambling nomination acceptance speech. Next month’s Democratic convention in Chicago is shaping up to be very, very different. Whatever script the party and the Biden campaign had been working on just got thrown out the window. Even if the party falls in line behind Harris, it will be difficult to plan - and control - how things unfold on the convention floor. And if Harris doesn’t succeed in uniting the party, the convention could turn into a political free-for-all, with various candidates vying for the nomination before the cameras and behind closed doors. It could make for gripping political theatre, live and unpredictable, in a way the American public has never before witnessed. This year’s Republican convention was a carefully calibrated machine, promoting the party’s most popular agenda items and focusing criticism on one man, President Joe Biden. It turns out, the Republicans were targeting the wrong guy. With the news of Biden’s abandoning of his re-election campaign, the Republican game plan spearheaded by Donald Trump has been turned on its head. The Republicans spent an entire week of carefully scripted events focusing on the wrong weaknesses of the Democrat opposing them. The campaign had highlighted their candidate’s strength and vitality by giving him a raucous entrance, preceded by appearances by former wrestler Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Fighting Championship impresario Dana White, as well as a performance by Kid Rock.  The attempts at contrast with Mr Biden’s perceived frailty - and the strategy to peel away younger male voters - were obvious. But in any scenario now, the Democratic nominee is going to be someone much younger than the president. A strategy of strong vs frail against Vice-President Kamala Harris or one of the more youthful Democratic governors who are mentioned as possible Biden successors just won’t pack the same punch. If Harris is the nominee, expect the Republicans to try to tie her to the perceived failings of the current administration. For months they have called her the ""border czar"". Although the former prosecutor is by no means from the progressive wing of the party, previous Republican attacks on her suggest they may also paint her as ""radical left"".  No matter who the nominee is, the Republicans are sure to blame the Democrats for covering up Biden’s age-related weaknesses - and putting the nation at risk. At this point, everyone is flying blind with just a few months until the first presidential ballots are cast.",2024-07-21 23:10:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwd8yzw45qo,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-21 21:10:18,
597,Biden ends election campaign and endorses Harris as Democratic nominee,"Barbara Plett UsherNews correspondent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit Washington this week, at a chaotic time for the Democrats.  That adds an element of uncertainty to an atmosphere already strained over his conduct of the war in Gaza. Netanyahu's supposed to meet President Joe Biden and address a joint session of Congress. The White House has been pressing him to cut a ceasefire deal with Hamas that would see the release of hostages, but Netanyahu has carried on with military pressure and added conditions to the agreement.  Analysts had said he was feeling emboldened by Biden’s weakened presidency.  But the Democrats are invested in a Gaza ceasefire. They don't want the war to spread, they're under pressure from voters, and they see it as a key step to ending the conflict. They’ll continue to pursue it regardless of Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race.  And if Kamala Harris becomes the nominee, she could be tougher on Israel.  She might ""more closely align with the sentiments of younger elements of the Democratic Party,"" says Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East. ""A stance more likely to include restrictions on weapons, on munitions from the United States for use in Gaza.""",2024-07-21 23:10:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cv2gryx1yx1t,Unknown,Unknown,
601,Biden has endorsed Harris. What happens next?,"President Joe Biden surprised American voters on Sunday when he announced he would drop out of the race for president after weeks of resisting calls to step down.  Though he will carry out the rest of his presidency, he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place as the Democratic Party's nominee.  The decision throws the party into uncharted waters with just a month to go before the Democratic National Convention.  Here's a guide to what could come next. The last time an incumbent US president abandoned their campaign for re-election was Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1968. As a result, the path for nominating a new candidate so close to Election Day is unclear.  President Biden had already won 3,896 pledged delegates - much more than the amount needed to secure his party's nomination.  While Mr Biden's endorsement makes Ms Harris the most likely pick for the nominee, after he releases his delegates, they are no longer pledged to a candidate.  It will ultimately be up to them to vote for whomever they choose.  The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to begin on 19 August.  If the Democratic Party does not come together to support a new candidate, that could set the stage for an open convention for the first time since 1968.  That would mean delegates would be free to decide who to vote for among multiple candidates if they emerge. Candidates would need signatures from at least 300 delegates - no more than 50 coming from one state - for their name to appear on the ballot.  There would be an initial round of voting among the 3,900 pledged delegates, which includes voters deemed loyal to the Democratic party.  If no candidate receives a majority of votes after this first round, then more rounds of voting would take place. These rounds of voting would include superdelegates - party leaders and elected officials - who would all cast ballots until a nominee is chosen.  To secure the party nomination, a candidate needs 1,976 delegate votes. As calls grew for Mr Biden to drop out of the race in recent weeks, a number of potential replacements emerged.  Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been floated as a candidate, though she has said she would not consider running if Mr Biden stepped aside. On Sunday, minutes after Mr Biden's announcement, she said she would do everything she can ""to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump"". Other options include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  Some of these candidates could be considered for the role of vice president if Ms Harris does ultimately win the nomination.

595,Republicans call on Biden to leave White House,"Many Republicans quickly called on President Joe Biden to resign and leave the White House after his announcement on Sunday that he would withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. Republican leaders said that Mr Biden's decision to step aside confirmed their view that he was not in cognitive shape to serve as president - an issue that has dogged the Democrat since his disastrous debate last month.   ""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as president,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, the most powerful Republican in congress. ""He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,"" referring to election day. Mr Biden, in announcing that he was dropping out,  said he would stay in office until the end of his term in January. The White House a few hours later on Sunday reiterated he would not resign, stating: ""He looks forward to finish his term and delivering more historic results for the American people."" Leading Republicans piled on with similar calls to resign throughout Sunday afternoon, as they also directed fresh attacks at Vice-President Kamala Harris, who would move into the Oval Office should Mr Biden resign. Mr Biden has endorsed her to be the next Democratic nominee.  New York Representative Elise Stefanik, the Republican conference chair, made almost the exact same statement as Mr Johnson's about Mr Biden's ability to fulfil his presidential duties.  She closed her statement similarly as well: ""He must immediately resign."" Mr Biden's rival for president, Donald Trump, said the Democratic leader was ""not fit to serve from the very beginning"" in response to the announcement - though he did not call for the president to resign. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who chairs Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said that being president  ""is the hardest job in the world"".  ""And I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,” he said in a statement.  Another Republican senator, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, went further and appeared to suggest that Mr Biden should be forced from office by exercising the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution - a never-used method to replace the president if he cannot fulfil his duties.  Critics of Trump had called for using the amendment to remove him when he was in office. Many in the political world had been expecting to Mr Biden to drop out of the race.  His rambling, frequently incoherent answers in the June 27 debate with Trump had stunned the country and left people wondering if he could serve as president for another four years. While in speeches and interviews Mr Biden often showed renewed vigour, he was also dogged by major stumbles and seeming memory problems.  Democrats in congress, worried that his shakiness would hurt their chances at re-election, and major donors began to press for him to drop out, but they did not press for him to resign.   The last president to abandon his election campaign, Lyndon B. Johnson, also served out the remainder of his term. Like Mr Biden, Johnson had said that giving up the race would allow him to focus on his presidential duties.  As the pressure on Mr Biden has grown in recent weeks, Republicans became more vocal about a resignation. Just hours before the president announced he was stepping aside, Trump's new running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, said: ""Not running for reelection would be a clear admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough to serve as Commander-in-Chief. There is no middle ground."" ""Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way,"" he added. Mr Biden has endorsed Ms Harris to take up the mantle of the presidential campaign, although the party will still have to formally approve its nominee. ""I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" Ms Harris said in a statement. ""I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda."" Republicans have reportedly prepared to attack Ms Harris's candidacy - as many believed she was the most likely successor.  Trump campaign sources have told US media outlets that they were readying attack ads and opposition research in case they faced her.  Most criticism centres on the vice-president's lead role on immigration issues within the administration. Several speakers at the Republican convention last week portrayed Ms Harris as a failed ""border czar"".  Those attacks returned on Sunday. Speaker Johnson called her ""a completely inept border czar"" and said she had been ""a gleeful accomplice"" in ""the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity"". ""She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve,"" he said, while also accusing her of being part of a political coverup of Mr Biden's problems. Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, known for taking a hard line on immigration that has led to legal actions, also expressed concerns about Ms Harris becoming president.  ""I think I will need to triple the border wall, razor wire barriers and National Guard on the border,"" he wrote on social media. Donald Trump Jr, the former president's son, broadly said her policies would be no different than Mr Biden's. ""Kamala Harris owns the entire left-wing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter.",2024-07-21 23:10:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd0ek9el6ro,"Phil McCausland & Bernd Debusmann,",2024-07-21 22:20:18,
592,Who could challenge Harris for Democratic nomination?,"Joe Biden on Sunday announced he would end his re-election campaign, and said Kamala Harris, his vice-president, should take his place.  ""I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,"" he wrote on X. ""Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump."" Ms Harris taking over is not a done deal, however.  Several others have been touted as potential replacements in the weeks leading to Mr Biden's withdrawal. Many have paid tribute to Mr Biden after his announcement - but crucially almost none have said explicitly that they support the Harris endorsement.  Delegates will vote next month at the Democratic National Convention to officially confirm who will replace Mr Biden. Here is a look at the names who could challenge Ms Harris. Gretchen Whitmer, the two-term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular Midwest Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  Ms Whitmer quickly stated after Mr Biden's withdrawal that her job ""will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump."" That, however, was not an endorsement of Ms Harris. California's governor is one of the Biden administration's fiercest surrogates. But he has political ambitions of his own.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits now say that he could replace Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  He stood by the president before his announcement. He travelled to Washington to attend meetings in July with Mr Biden and other top Democratic governors, and headlined a Biden campaign event in Michigan on the 4 July. Mr Newsom again praised Mr Biden as a ""selfless"" president after his withdrawal was announced. But his statement on Twitter was brief, and mentioned nothing of his own intentions nor commented on the endorsement of Ms Harris. It is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as transportation secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Mr Buttigieg stated on Twitter/X that Mr Biden had ""earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history"". He did not comment on his endorsement of Ms Harris. Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The speedy repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  Mr Shapiro said Mr Biden was one of the ""most consequential presidents in modern history"" after the president announced his withdrawal from the election race but - like most names touted to replace him - said nothing of what comes next.  JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats' to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  He did not immediately comment on Mr Biden's decision to withdraw from the election race. The list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.   Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.  Maryland Governor Wes Moore found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested Senate race in a swing state, also has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.  A Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama. But the former first lady has repeatedly said she does not have presidential aspirations.

596,The many identities of the first woman vice-president,"Less than four months out from the election, Vice-President Kamala Harris found herself in a difficult position. President Joe Biden's poor performance on the debate stage spurred mounting criticism about his ability to win the election. As anxiety turned to tension within the Democratic party, her name rose up the list of replacement candidates. With Mr Biden’s announcement that he will be ending his campaign and putting his support behind her, Ms Harris has finally reached a position she’d long sought: the top of the Democratic ticket, and potentially the presidency. But the journey there has been fraught and full of difficult questions, especially in recent months. Four years ago, the one-time candidate for the Democratic nomination would have welcomed the party's praises. By July 2024, Harris was in a more precarious position as part of an embattled incumbent ticket, her chances of another term tethered to Mr Biden’s performance. In the 24 hours after the debate debacle, Ms Harris chose strong loyalty to Mr Biden. The vice-president spoke on CNN, MSNBC and at a campaign rally. She defended her political partner's record and attacked their opponent, former President Donald Trump. “We believe in our president, Joe Biden, and we believe in what he stands for,” she said at the rally. Ms Harris never wavered as a new well of support within the Democratic party pushed her into the spotlight and critics pressed Mr Biden to retire. Still, it’s a second chance at a presidential campaign for the first woman as well as the first black and Asian-American to serve as vice-president. Despite struggling to appeal to voters in 2020 and having low approval ratings during her tenure as vice president, Ms Harris' supporters point to her advocacy for reproductive rights, appeal among black voters and her background as a prosecutor who would be running against a now-convicted felon to make the case for her serving as commander-in-chief. ""I believe she has been instrumental in addressing key issues such as voting rights and immigration reform,"" Nadia Brown, director of Georgetown University's Women's and Gender Studies Program, said.  ""She has also been Biden's most powerful surrogate on issues of abortion access and outreach to black communities."" Just five years ago, Ms Harris was the senator from California hoping to win the Democratic nomination for presidency.  She began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, before being elected the first woman and the first black person to serve as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. She gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. But her presidential aims were unsuccessful in 2020. Her adept debate performances were not enough to compensate for poorly articulated policies. Her campaign died in less than a year and it was Mr Biden who returned the now 59-year-old to the national spotlight by putting her on his ticket. Gil Duran, a communications director for Ms Harris in 2013 who critiqued her run for the presidential nomination, called it “a big reversal of fortune for Kamala Harris”. ""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent,” Duran said.  Ms Harris focused on several key initiatives while in the White House and she was instrumental in some of the Biden administration's most touted accomplishments. She launched a nationwide “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour advocating for women to have the right to make decisions about their body. She highlighted harm caused by abortion bans and called on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v Wade after the Supreme Court's conservative justices overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Ms Harris set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president in the history of the Senate. Her vote helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which provided COVID relief funding including stimulus payments.  Her tie-breaking vote also confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown Jakson to the Supreme Court. But she also struggled to achieve broad appeal among Americans, facing criticism on all sides.  Despite leftward leanings on issues like gay marriage and the death penalty, she faced repeated attacks for not being progressive enough for some Democratic voters. ""Kamala is a cop"" was a common refrain on the 2020 campaign trail.  Mr Biden also called upon Ms Harris to lead efforts addressing the root causes of migration as a record number of immigrants fled to the US-Mexico border, an issue opponents point to as one where she hasn't made enough progress.  She received backlash from Republicans and some Democrats for taking six months to plan a trip to the border after entering office. But in recent weeks, as speculation about Mr Biden's ability to win in November swirled, she found a renewed base of support.  Born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents - an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father - her parents divorced when she was five and she was primarily raised by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist. She grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but Ms Harris has said that her mother adopted Oakland's black culture, immersing her two daughters - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - within it. ""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women."" Her biracial roots and upbringing mean she embodies and can engage with and appeal to many American identities. Those parts of the country which have seen rapid demographic change, enough change to alter a region's politics, see an aspirational symbol in her. But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life. Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather in the Yard area of the campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip. ""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation,"" she said. They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even just both being the Libra star sign. It was a formative era politically too. ""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa' and the Martin Luther King holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson said. ""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explained - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived. But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a brief period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Ms Harris and her younger sister Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"". She told the Washington Post in 2019 that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background. ""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said. From the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers. ""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness,"" she said. Wit and humour is part of that armoury. In a video posted to her social media in 2020 after winning the election, she shares the news of the win - with a very hearty laugh - with Mr Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!"" The laugh she greeted the then president-elect with, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately. ""It clearly shows her personality, even in the short time she has been on the campaign trail."" ""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate - to get those points across."" The ability to deliver zingers to her opponents in live debate was very much part of the momentum behind the start of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 2014, then-Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff and became stepmother to his two children. She wrote an article for Elle magazine in 2019 about the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that would then come to dominate many headlines that followed. ""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'."" They were portrayed as the epitome of modern American ""blended"" family, an image the media took to and one that occupied many column inches about how we talk about female politicians. Many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists. ""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House. Black women are seen as a political force of nature in democratic politics and the Democratic party,"" Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC. Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark are some of the names she follows in the footsteps of, Ms Brown argues. ""Her win is historic but it is not hers alone. It is shared with countless black women who made this day possible.""",2024-07-21 23:10:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2501n5rvvno,"Rachel Looker and Holly Honderich,",2024-07-21 19:10:18,
594,Republicans turn heat up on Secret Service chief over Trump shooting,"Republican lawmakers are planning to return to Congress on Monday with the director of the Secret Service in their sights, as their frustration and anger grow over the agency's response to an assassination attempt against Donald Trump.  First on the agenda will be a House committee hearing on Monday with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, which Speaker Mike Johnson said would make for ""must-see TV"" for Americans concerned about security lapses at the Pennsylvania rally.  ""She's got a lot to answer for. And these concerns are bipartisan,"" Mr Johnson told CNN on Sunday. Republicans, who control the House, have been unified in pushing Ms Cheatle to step down - or be fired -  after a 20-year-old gunman was able to shoot the former president in the ear at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally last Saturday.  Many of the lawmakers confronted her at the Republican convention last week, releasing videos of them demanding answers. Her agency is charged with providing protection to more than the president and his family, including former presidents, others in line to the White House and political candidates. US media is reporting that Trump had sought additional security in the months leading up to the assassination attempt, but the agency had turned them down or been unable to fulfill the requests due to staffing shortages. CBS News, BBC's news partner, has reported that Trump's security frustrations go back two years. Agency spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that ""in some instances where specific Secret Service specialized units or resources were not provided, the agency made modifications"". That included relying on state and local law enforcement. Eric Trump, the former president's son, said he had been calling for beefed up security throughout the campaign, as he blamed the Biden administration and Ms Cheatle on Sunday for the assassination attempt and argued there had been ""no accountability"" for the agency's actions.  ""She should be out of a job,"" he told Fox News.  Speaking to CNN, Mr Johnson said that in addition to the House hearing, lawmakers on Monday would release more details about a bipartisan task force with subpoena authority charged with investigating the Secret Service's response.  ""The initial excuses that [Ms Cheatle] has given for the lapses that happened last Saturday are just unbelievable, so we're going to get down to the bottom of it,"" he said. Senators, too, are preparing to dig in on the Secret Service. Republican Senator Ron Johnson told Fox News on Sunday that he would soon release ""preliminary"" information from his own report investigating the attack.  That report is intended to encourage people to come forward with more footage and firsthand accounts. He added that his investigation is now bipartisan, and will be conducted with Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general is also looking the attack, which occurred after the Secret Service identified the gunman as suspicious some 20 minutes before he opened fire, lawmakers revealed this weekend.   Mr Johnson's appearance on CNN came just a day after reports emerged that top officials at the Secret Service had denied some requests from Trump's security team for additional resources in the two years leading up to the assassination attempt.  The report, first published in the Washington Post, said the agency had refused additional resources such as more agents and snipers because of a lack of resources and staffing shortages within the Secret Service.  Mr Johnson blamed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for failing to allocate more resources to the Secret Service, an agency that it oversees.  The Republican House speaker told CNN on Sunday that Congress had increased funding to DHS in recent years, but that DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was responsible for ensuring the Secret Service had enough funds.  ""Secretary Mayorkas is in charge of that agency. If he needed to allocate more resources to the Secret Service than that should have been done,"" Mr Johnson said.  Mr Johnson added that he had spoken with Mr Mayorkas hours after the assassination attempt and that the DHS leader was unable to answer ""basic questions"", including whether the gunman, Thomas Crooks, had used a drone to survey the outdoor rally area.  Law enforcement officials told US media on Saturday that Crooks had flown a drone above the site ahead of the shooting.  Trump has made several appearances since the incident, including at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Saturday, where he told the crowd that he ""took a bullet for Democracy"".  His former White House physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, released a statement the same day saying the bullet created a 2cm-wide wound on Trump's ear that was beginning to ""heal properly"".

593,Couple found dead after trying to cross Atlantic,"The bodies of a couple who set off on a sailing trip across the Atlantic Ocean have been found on a washed-up life raft almost six weeks after they were last seen. Briton Sarah Packwood and her Canadian husband Brett Clibbery are thought to have abandoned their yacht and perished before washing up on Sable Island near Nova Scotia in Canada on 12 July. The couple were reported missing on 18 June after leaving Nova Scotia in their 13m (42ft) eco-friendly yacht, Theros, a week earlier. They were on the way to the Azores – about 3,228 km away – with the trip planned to take 21 days. In a post on Facebook, Mr Clibbery's son James confirmed the pair had died, saying that the last few days had been “very hard”. He said the couple would be ""forever missed"", adding: ""There isn't anything that will fill the hole that has been left by their, so far unexplained passing."" It is unclear how the couple’s dream transatlantic crossing ended in tragedy. An investigation is still under way, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told the BBC on Sunday. One theory investigators are exploring is that the yacht was struck by a passing cargo ship that did not notice the collision, according to Canadian news website Saltwire. “The sailboat crew were either unable to avoid collision” or they could have been down below with Theros on automatic pilot, an anonymous source told Saltwire. The Canadian coastguard and military aircraft have not spotted wreckage or any sign of the boat, Saltwire reports.  In a video posted to their YouTube channel, Theros Adventures, the pair explained how their trip - dubbed the Green Odyssey - would rely on sails, solar panels, batteries and an electric engine repurposed from a car. “We’re doing everything we can to show that you can travel without burning fossil fuels,” Mr Clibbery said in the video, posted on 12 April. “It’s probably the biggest adventure of our lives so far,” Ms Packwood added. The pair met by chance in London in 2015, when Mr Clibbery, a retired engineer, was preparing to donate a kidney to his sister. They married in Canada on their yacht a year later, before affirming their vows in a traditional handfasting ceremony at Stonehenge in 2017, according to Ms Packwood’s personal blog. Their story was featured in a 2020 “How We Met” article in The Guardian. Ms Packwood, originally from Long Itchington, Warwickshire, had worked in Rwanda with the UN after the 1994 genocide and had extensive experience as a humanitarian. In what would be their final post on 11 June, the pair wrote on Facebook: “Captain Brett and First Mate Sarah set sail on the 2nd leg of The Green Odyssey on board Theros - GibSea 42 foot sailboat.

613,Trump tells Michigan rally he 'took a bullet for democracy',"Donald Trump has told a rally in Michigan that he ""took a bullet for democracy"" when an attempt was made on his life last week. He also derided President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the event in Grand Rapids - his first with new running mate JD Vance and the first since he survived the assassination attempt. He told a packed arena that Democrats had accused him of being ""a threat to democracy"" and, to huge applause, said he was ready to ""take back the White House"". An investigation is under way into the shooting last weekend, which left Trump with a wounded ear - though the prominent white bandage he wore throughout the Republican National Convention had on Saturday been replaced by a discreet flesh-toned plaster. The gunman flew a drone above the site of the shooting ahead of time, law enforcement officials have told US media. The Grand Rapids event was one of several campaign stops the former president has made in the key battleground state, as polls show him in a close race against Mr Biden. Mr Biden, meanwhile, has had to pause campaign events after testing positive for Covid-19. He continues to resist growing calls from members of his own party to drop out of the race due to concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. During his speech Mr Trump repeated the falsehood that the 2020 election - which he lost to Mr Biden - had been ""rigged"". He mocked the crisis around Mr Biden's own bid for re-election as president, saying: ""They don't know who their candidate is, and neither do we."" In rhetoric that departed from his calls for unity immediately after the shooting, he used insulting language about Mr Biden and about Ms Harris, who is well-placed to become the Democratic nominee if Mr Biden steps aside. Mr Trump again sought to distance himself from Project 2025 - a detailed 900-page proposal from the Heritage Foundation think tank.  Led by former Trump administration officials, Project 2025 calls for measures including the sacking of thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education, sweeping tax cuts, a ban on pornography and halting sales of the abortion pill. ""The radical right... they're seriously extreme,"" he said.  Trump was not scheduled to address the crowd until 17:00 EST (21:00 GMT) but by 13:00, a line stretched for about three miles (4.8km) outside the 12,000-person Van Del Arena. Many of those at the event, in the battleground state of Michigan, told the BBC that the assassination attempt - which killed an audience member and wounded two others - would not stop them from showing support for the Republican presidential nominee.  Some said they came precisely because of the shooting. Unlike that rally, held in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Grand Rapids event was indoors - allowing security officers to carefully monitor who entered and to cut off threats from outside the rally. In his speech, Trump thanked the “thousands and thousands” of people who came to see him “almost exactly” a week after the assassination attempt. “I stand before you only by the grace of almighty God,” he said, repeating his belief that divine intervention saved him from being killed. Wendy and Steve Upcott of Clarkston, Michigan, were among the thousands who drove from all over the state to see him, many reassured by the increased security. The couple said their 26-year-old daughter begged them not to attend the event two hours from home, fearing for their safety in the wake of the assassination attempt. But they felt obliged to come after the shooting last weekend. “The chances of it happening again just one week to the day later is unlikely,” said Ms Upcott. Them and many others in Grand Rapids were decked out in red Make America Great Again caps, along with cowboy hats, shirts and full outfits resembling the American flag. T-shirts with Trump's mug shot were also for sale. Laura Schultz said she thought about her safety on Saturday morning before she decided to come to the event with a friend. “You can’t let fear stop you,” she said. Other rally-goers, including several young adults, said the assassination attempt pushed them to attend the Michigan rally. It was the first Trump campaign event for fellow Donald, a 24 year old from Grand Rapids, who wore a shirt with the viral image of Trump pumping his fist after being shot. “This is the first event after the attempted assassination. I think it’s probably going to be the most important rally,” he said,  declining to share his last name. Donald said he had no fears for his own safety, because of the hundreds of police officers, including some on horseback. But others said they remained scared for Trump. “It should be a concern for most Americans that he is still not safe,” Ms Upcott said. “He needs to be very careful,” said Ms Schultz. Other supporters expressed outrage at the US Secret Service over the incident last week.  The agency has faced intense scrutiny after shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to take aim at Trump in Pennsylvania by climbing onto a roof of a building near the rally stage, even after rallygoers pointed him out to police. Investigators have still yet to name a motive for the 20-year-old gunman who was later killed by Secret Service agents. Since then, the country has become more attuned to possible threats to both presidential candidates. Police in Jupiter, Florida, on Friday arrested a man for allegedly posting threats to Trump on social media, while a different man from Florida was arrested a few days earlier for allegedly threatening President Joe Biden. Saturday's Michigan indoor event space was much easier to secure, with metal detectors and military personnel sweeping the whole building, said former Secret Service agent Jason Russell, who has worked on campaign events at the Grand Rapids arena. “You’ll have a pretty, pretty significant number of agents on site,” Mr Russell said, adding that they would be able to keep Trump out of view until his entrance. On Saturday, the former White House physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, released a statement about his condition after having examined Trump.  The bullet created a 2cm-wide wound on Trump's ear that extended down to the cartilage, Dr Jackson said, which is beginning to ""heal properly."" No stitches had been needed, he added. Trump's campaign also announced that it plans to hold its next rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on 24 July at the Bojangles Coliseum.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngwzd4y83o,"Madeline Halpert,",2024-07-21 03:10:19,
612,Trump shooter flew drone above rally site ahead of time - US media,"The gunman who tried to assassinate Donald Trump flew a drone above the site of the shooting ahead of time, law enforcement officials have told US media.  They say it remains unclear whether Thomas Matthew Crooks did this hours or days before the fateful rally in Pennsylvania on 13 July, reports CBS, the BBC's US media partner. Trump, now officially the Republican presidential nominee, has said he was saved ""by luck or by God"" when a bullet pierced his right ear during a campaign speech. A spectator was killed in the attack, while two others were seriously injured. Crooks, 20, was shot dead at the scene by Security Service agents, who have come under intense scrutiny over the precautions taken to protect Trump at the rally - held outside in the city of Butler.  Security Service chief Kimberly Cheatle has been summoned to testify before a committee of the US House of Representatives on 22 July. First reported by the Wall Street Journal, investigators told CBS they were still trying to determine when exactly Crooks flew the drone. They said they believed it was within days of the rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds. Other US outlets, also citing security officials, claimed the device was flown above the area on the day the event took place. The drone is thought to have been used by the shooter to pick the best line of sight for the podium where Trump was due to speak. Crooks fired multiple shots from the roof of a building that was little more than 130m (430ft) from Trump. In an interview with Fox News to be broadcast in full on Monday, Trump said nobody had warned him before he went on stage that there was a potential shooter. ""How did somebody get on that roof? And why wasn't he reported, because people saw he was on that roof,"" he said. The drone - found in the gunman's vehicle after the attack - is now being examined by investigators. Two explosive devices, a tactical vest, and four magazines full of the same ammunition used in the attack were also discovered in the shooter's vehicle. The development comes as US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas hit back at accusations by ""some people"" questioning the presence of women in law enforcement.  He praised ""highly skilled and trained"" women serving at every level ""who risk their lives on the front lines for the safety and security of others"". Several female agents were part of Trump's security protocol during the shooting in Butler, shielding him after the shots were fired and leading him from the stage to a nearby security vehicle.  A number of social media users - including influential US conservative activists - later suggested that female agents were not best suited for jobs in the Secret Service. ""There should not be any women in the Secret Service,"" one such activist, Matt Walsh, wrote on X. ""These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women."" Some also criticised hiring practices that were focusing too much on diversity, equity and inclusion. Mr Mayorkas said the Department of Homeland Security would ""with great pride, focus and devotion to mission, continue to recruit, retain and elevate women in our law enforcement ranks"". ""Our department will be the better for it, and our country more secure,"" he added.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0xj5w3nx7yo,"Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-21 05:10:19,
611,Alert issued in India after boy dies from high risk Nipah virus,"Health authorities in India's Kerala state have issued an alert after a 14-year-old boy died of the Nipah virus.  According to the state's health minister, an additional 60 people have been identified as being in the high-risk category of having the disease.  Kerala Health Minister Veena George said the boy was from the town of Pandikkad and that those who came into contact with him have been isolated and tested.  People in the area have been asked to take precautions such as wearing masks in public areas and refraining from visiting people in hospital.  The Nipah virus infection is a ""zoonotic illness"" transmitted from animals like pigs and fruit bats to humans, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can also be transmitted through contaminated food and through contact with an infected person. The WHO has described the virus as a priority pathogen by the WHO because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.  The virus has been linked to dozens of deaths in Kerala state since it was first reported there in 2018.  The 14-year-old died on Sunday, just a day after he was confirmed to have the virus, according to Indian media reports.  It can also be transmitted through contaminated food and through contact with an infected person. Parts of Kerala are said to be the most at-risk globally for the virus. An investigation   published by Reuters last year found that Kerala, which is a tropical state and is witnessing rapid urbanisation and rapid tree loss, created ""ideal conditions for a virus like Nipah to emerge"".  Experts say that due to habitat loss, animals are living in closer proximity to humans and this helps the virus jump from animals to humans.  The state government recently announced that it was creating an action plan to prevent a Nipah outbreak.  Last year, authorities in Kerala state closed schools and offices after confirming five cases.

609,Schauffele holds off Rose to win Open at Troon,"This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Xander Schauffele's winning round Final leaderboard -9 Schauffele (US); -7 Rose (Eng), Horschel (US); -6 Lawrence (SA) Selected: -5 Henley (US); -4 Lowry (Ire); -1 Rahm (Spa), Im (Kor), Scheffler (US); Level Jordan (Eng), Brown (Eng) Full leaderboard Xander Schauffele held off the challenge of Justin Rose to win the 152nd Open Championship at the end of a captivating week at Royal Troon. It is a second major title in three months for 30-year-old Schauffele, who becomes the first player to win The Open and US PGA Championship in the same year since Rory McIlroy in 2014. The American hit a stunning bogey-free six-under 65 to finish on nine under, two clear of his playing partner Rose, who shot a 67 in a fascinating duel in breezy conditions. ""Hearing your name called with Open champion after it is something I've dreamed of for a very long time,"" said the Champion Golfer of the Year. For Rose, whose sole major remains his 2013 US Open triumph, it has been the closest he has come to lifting the Claret Jug, 26 years after he finished joint fourth as a 17-year-old to win the Silver Medal as low amateur. ""The dream's been alive all week and I did an awesome job,"" the 43-year-old, who came through a qualifying event in Somerset, told BBC Sport. ""This will be a tough one but a great one. I played in some of the hardest weather all week. I played some of the best golf but it didn't quite add up to the trophy."" Three birdies in his opening seven holes had put Rose briefly in the lead on six under, but Schauffele surged three clear of his fellow Olympic gold medallist with an electrifying run of five birdies in nine holes from the sixth. Overnight leader Billy Horschel birded the final three holes to join Rose in joint second.

And his win here means all four men's majors have been won by American players for the first time since 1982, with Scottie Scheffler claiming his second Masters in April, and Bryson DeChambeau the US Open in June. ""I thought [winning the US PGA Championship] would help me and it actually did,"" said Schauffele. ""I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn't have when I played earlier at the PGA.  ""For some reason, I was calm and collected. I was telling my caddie Austin that I felt pretty calm coming down the stretch and he said he was about to puke on the 18th tee! ""I just told myself to just hit it down there and keep moving along."" This video can not be played Watch the best shots from the 152nd Open Championship With six players tied for second at the start of play, the most going into the final round of a major for 30 years, there was bound to be drama. And it began before the leaders teed off. Spain's Jon Rahm, who resumed on two over par, opened with three successive birdies and added another on the seventh to get to two under, just two behind overnight leader Horschel.  But while there were birdies to be had on the front nine, Rahm also showed how tough the back nine would be as he had eight pars and a bogey to finish on one under. Shane Lowry, who started at one under, was the first of the serious contenders to charge, with four birdies in five holes as he reached the turn at four under, his eventual finishing total. But those behind him were also making headway. World number one Scheffler briefly flickered, reaching four under after eight but a three-putt double bogey from eight feet on the ninth stalled his challenge and he closed with another six at the last to post a 72 and one-under total. Rose was three under for his front nine as he briefly led on six under. Schauffele picked up shots at the sixth and seventh holes, and then had the only birdie of the day on the par-four 11th to join Rose. By this point, South African Thriston Lawrence, out in the final group with Horschel, had gone one clear on seven under after four birdies on his front nine. Horschel was hanging in there. The overnight leader birdied three of his opening five holes to get to six under but bogeys on the eighth and 10th holes looked to have ended his hopes. Three successive birdies to finish joint second came with the pressure of winning off. While others faded at the start of the back nine - Sam Burns, who was among those in second place at the start of day, dropped six shots on the 10th, 11th and 12th holes as he posted an 80 - Schauffele stomped on the accelerator. He was the only player on Sunday to birdie the notoriously tough 11th and picked up two more on the 13th and 14th holes to reach eight under. It was the turning point. Schauffele was suddenly two clear of Lawrence and three clear of Rose, who both bogeyed the 12th. Schauffele and Rose both birdied the long 16th and the American knew at that point he was almost home. Two pars were enough, while Rose saluted the crowd after rounding off his championship with a birdie at the last before warmly embracing the victor. Rose at least has the comfort of knowing that he has already qualified for next year's Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. Also qualified for 2025 are fellow Englishmen Dan Brown and Matthew Jordan, who ended level par and joint 10th. Brown, the world number 272, led after round one and continued to defy expectation throughout the week but finally faded on Sunday. Like Rose, he too began the final round one off the lead but, playing with Scheffler, he had four bogeys in his opening six holes and he closed with a 74. It means England's hopes of a first winner of The Open extend to a 33rd year, with Sir Nick Faldo's triumph at Muirfield in 1992 still the last. Scotland's Calum Scott scooped the Silver Medal as low amateur. His closing 76 won him that title on eight over par.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cm52xd9ne1no,Peter Scrivener,2024-07-21 23:10:19,
607,Inches from death: An hour that shook America,"The flinch was instinctive as the first crack sounded around Butler's showgrounds. Donald Trump's hand darted to his ear as more cracks came in. Screams welled up from the crowd as he ducked, and as Secret Service agents buried him in the mass of their bodies. It had just gone 18:12 on Saturday, 13 July, and Thomas Matthew Crooks, having already been flagged by police as suspicious, had managed to climb onto a warehouse roof, line up his AR-15 style rifle, and fire a hail of bullets towards the former president.  What happened in just a few moments at Butler Farm Show grounds would shake American politics, and leave a nation asking how a man was able to enter the grounds with a powerful gun, climb to a firing spot unchallenged, and get within an inch of Trump's life. Using witness accounts, original reporting and statements from law enforcement, the BBC has pieced together a picture of the events that chaotic day.  The late afternoon summer sun beat down from a clear blue sky, as this small town in Pennsylvania prepared for its biggest spectacle in years. The crowds were flocking to a showground transformed into a slice of Americana; everything festooned in red, white and blue, a sea of flags, campaign posters covering almost every surface. Greg Smith was among them. He had spent the day at his home in Butler with friends and family, eating BBQ and drinking beer, before heading down the road to take in the spectacle. ""We were hanging out, having a party. Then we were all like 'hey, Trump's here - let's walk up to the rally and look at him through the fence',"" he told the BBC. ""It was just a good time."" Corey Comperatore, 50, a retired volunteer firefighter and avowed Trump supporter, was also there with his wife and one of their two daughters. They scored a prime spot to the right of the stage, and waited for the show to begin. Local police mingled with the crowd outside the event's security fences. Secret Service agents and state police worked together inside the perimeter, while anti-sniper teams were positioned on roofs of nearby buildings, watching. Somewhere in that crowd was Crooks, a 20-year-old from nearby Bethel Park. But he wasn't with family, or friends, and his motivations were not the same. In the hours before, his parents Matthew and Mary had reported him missing to the police, saying they were ""worried"" that he had disappeared. At some point before the rally, too, Crooks had scoped out the area using a drone, according to US media reports. Security sources told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, that Crooks first came to the attention of police at 17:10, 52 minutes before Trump took to the stage, and was ""identified as a person of interest"". Why was that not disclosed? It was 20 minutes later, at 17:30, that Crooks was noticed looking at a roof by a local SWAT team stationed in buildings outside the security perimeter. One officer took a photo and radioed to others that he had seen a man peering through a rangefinder - a device hunters use to measure distance to a target. They did not report seeing a gun. Crooks remained free to wander. Another 22 minutes passed before Crooks was again spotted - at 17:52 - this time on the roof of a warehouse around 140m (400ft) from the stage. It was outside the security perimeter on a direct line of sight to the podium where Trump was due to speak. Mr Smith was near that building, standing by a tree, and spotted Crooks too. ""I looked over, and there's a guy crawling up the roof with a rifle,"" he told the BBC - the first time it appears anyone saw an actual weapon. ""We're telling police 'hey, there's a guy on the roof with a rifle', and they're running around on the ground like they don't know what's going on. It was, like, two minutes - this guy was crawling up the roof."" He said Secret Service agents on the roof of an adjacent building were ""looking with binoculars"" as he pointed. Trump takes the stage at 18:02 wearing a dark blue suit, open-neck white shirt and red Make America Great Again baseball cap. He is shadowed by three Secret Service agents in dark suits, white shirts and dark sunglasses. A full 10 minutes had elapsed since Crooks was spotted on the roof. God Bless the USA (I'm Proud To Be An American) by Lee Greenwood blasts from festival loudspeakers hoisted high in the air.  Walking past several gold-trimmed flags, Trump shakes hands with supporters to applause and cheers. Within a minute he is at the podium, the crowd as his backdrop chanting ""USA! USA!"" and holding banners reading ""Trump 2024"" and ""You're Fired"". ""This is a big crowd, a big, big beautiful crowd,"" he tells the gathering in its thousands. ""Hello Butler and hello to Pennsylvania, I'm thrilled to be back."" Around this time, approximately 140m away, Crooks is challenged by police. According to Tom Knights, Butler's township manager, four of the town's traffic officers are radioed about a suspicious person on the roof. They ""instinctively"" bolt from their posts to confront the danger. One of the officers is boosted by a colleague and pokes their head over the roof lip. They find themselves in the sights of an AR-15-style rifle held by a long-haired man with glasses. The officer is in an impossible position, and drops eight feet to the ground, according to Mr Knights. The officers radio another alert, but Crooks remains unhindered. Mr Smith later recalled continuing to point at the roof and yell to police. ""I'm standing here like this,"" he told the BBC, ""telling them 'hey there's a guy up here', and then I'm thinking in my mind like, 'why is Trump still talking? Why do I still hear him on stage?'"" But Trump is in full flow, launching into familiar topics about the country being ""stolen"", the ""rigged"" 2020 election, ""crooked"" Joe Biden and ""laughing"" Kamala Harris. Seven minutes in, at 18:09, he turns the topic to immigration. ""We have millions and millions of people in our country that shouldn't be here. Dangerous people. Criminals. Drug dealers,"" he says. At about 18:11, he goes ""off auto-cue"" and turns to a chart on his right showing immigration levels, and rails at Mr Biden's border policies. ""And if you want to really see something that said... take a look what happened..."" He doesn't finish his thought. The time is 18:12, and Crooks fires his first shot. A snap is heard and Trump flinches. More snaps, and Trump clutches his right ear and begins to duck beneath the podium. A shout of ""DOWN DOWN DOWN GET DOWN"" is heard as confused screams well up from the crowd. Within seconds the former president is mobbed by four Secret Service agents as yet more shots echo around the grounds. Shocked crowd members duck in their seats - there is nowhere to go. They know nothing of the condition of the former president now under a scrum of security. To the left of the stage, a loudspeaker rig appears to have been hit by a bullet, gas escaping from the hydraulics as the speakers begin falling to the ground. Confused screams become ever louder. A video posted to the TMZ website shows Crooks on the roof around this time, the air filled with the sounds of gunfire and the yells from people below. ""What is he doing?"" screams one woman, as a man warns ""he's turning this way, guys"". But Crooks has only seconds to live. Secret Service counter-snipers acquire him as a target within 11 seconds of his first shot. Fifteen seconds after that he is dead, CBS quoted security sources as saying. ""I heard about four or five shots and everyone was running,"" said Mr Smith afterwards. ""I stood by the tree and watched him get shot in the head by the Secret Service. They took him out but... security failure, 100%."" Back on the stage, Trump is buried under even more agents. ""Hold, hold are you ready? On you,"" says one of the guards as his words are picked up by the podium microphone. ""Move! Move!""  Officers in combat gear then take up positions around them, their assault rifles at the ready. ""Shooter's down, we're clear,"" an agent shouts and Trump is hoisted back into view. Blood covers his ear and there are spatters on his face and shirt collar, but he tells the agents, ""let me get my speaker, let me get my shoes.... wait wait wait.""  He then repeatedly punches his fist into the air and mouths the words ""fight, fight, fight"", before being hauled away by agents still using their bodies as cover. Shouts of ""USA! USA!"" rise up as Trump is led off the stage, approximately one minute and 10 seconds after the first shot. While the former president survived without serious injury, others had not. Some of Crooks' bullets missed Trump but struck the crowd. Mr Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter, was hit in the head as he shielded his family.  A doctor seated behind the stage, James Sweetland, tried to help. ""Someone over there was screaming, 'He's been shot, he's been shot',"" Dr Sweetland told the BBC.  ""The guy had spun around [and was] jammed between the benches. There was a lot of blood."" He couldn't do anything to help. Mr Comperatore was dead. Two other people, David Dutch, 57, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, were critically injured, but survived. A few hours later, back at home, Mr Smith recalled watching the ""terrifying"" aftermath on television. ""There were a lot of kids up there with us, terrified. They're still terrified. My kid was terrified, crying and begging me to take him home. ""I can't accept that there is ever a reason for something like this to happen."" The would-be assassin was dead, Trump had survived, but a nation remains in shock, still starved for answers about how this could happen so easily.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5yrv2kwexo,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-21 04:10:19,
610,Prime sued in trademark case by US Olympic committee,"The US Olympic and Paralympic Committee is suing Logan Paul and KSI's Prime energy drinks brand, accusing it of trademark infringement.  It claims that Prime is using trademarked Olympic phrases and symbols on a special edition of its hydration drink featuring basketball star and three-time Olympic gold medallist Kevin Durant.  The committee said it does not have an agreement with Prime for the use of its terminology and trademarks, and said its actions had been ""deliberate"" and ""in bad faith"". The BBC has contacted Prime for comment.  The committee filed the lawsuit in Colorado on Friday, and also accused Prime of using the trademarks in internet campaigns and promotions. The lawsuit, seen by the BBC's partner CBS News, said that consumers could be misled into thinking there is an agreement between the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Prime.  The organisation said it had issued a cease and desist letter to Prime, but the drinks brand had continued to market the product, using the branding.  Criticism has previously been levelled at the company due to it being marketed at a younger audience, with some schools in the UK issuing warnings or choosing to ban it.  While the company's energy drink contains caffeine, it also sells a drink marketed for ""hydration"", which is caffeine-free.  Earlier this month, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation into the brand due to the high caffeine content of its energy drink.  Responding to this, Prime has said that it complies with regulatory requirements in the countries it operates in.  Prime founders Logan Paul and KSI have over 40 million YouTube followers between them.   Prime was released in the UK with much hype in 2022 - resulting in some shops limiting the number of bottles which could be sold per customer. It has collaborated with some of the biggest sporting stars and teams in the world including Arsenal and the LA Dodgers.

605,"Uganda protest organisers playing with fire, president says","Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has warned protesters that they will be ""playing with fire"" if they press ahead with plans to stage an anti-corruption march to parliament on Tuesday.  Young Ugandans have been organising the march on social media to demand an end to corruption in government.  They have been partly inspired by their counterparts in neighbouring Kenya, who organised mass demonstrations that forced President William Ruto to drop plans to increase taxes. The protests have since morphed into calls for his resignation. In a televised address, Mr Museveni warned the Ugandan organisers that their planned protest would not be tolerated.  ""We are busy producing wealth… and you here want to disturb us. You are playing with fire because we cannot allow you to disturb us,"" he said. Mr Museveni is accused by his critics of ruling Uganda with an iron hand since taking power in 1986, but his supporters praise him for maintaining stability in the East African state. The president also accused some of the protest organisers of ""always working with foreigners"" to cause chaos in Uganda. He did not elaborate. Police had earlier announced that they had refused to give permission for the march to take place.  One of the main protest leaders told AFP news agency that they would go ahead with it. ""We don't need police permission to carry out a peaceful demonstration. It is our constitutional right,"" Louez Aloikin Opolose was quoted as saying.  The UK and US governments imposed sanctions on Uganda's parliamentary speaker, Anita Annet Among, earlier this year after she was accused of corruption. She has denied any wrongdoing. The sanctions bar her from travelling to the UK and the US. The UK also said that it would impose an asset freeze on her.  The UK has enforced similar sanctions on two government ministers who were sacked by Mr Museveni after they too were accused of corruption. Mary Goretti Kitutu and Agnes Nandutu have been charged in court over a scandal involving the theft of thousands of metal roofing sheets that were intended for vulnerable communities in the north-eastern Karamoja region.  Both have denied the charges.  In Kenya, President Ruto also called for an end to the protests that have hit his government, saying: ""Enough is enough.”  The protests are the biggest in Kenya since Mr Ruto took office after winning elections in 2022. Activists have planned further demonstrations for Tuesday to demand his resignation and for an end to what they call bad governance.  Addressing a rally in western Bomet County, Mr Ruto said the protest organisers could not remain ""anonymous"", and should “step forward and tell us what is this violence going to achieve”. Some protesters stormed parliament last month setting part of it on fire and stealing the mace, the symbol of the legislature's authority.  Protest organisers say their demonstrations have largely been peaceful.  They accuse the police and the military of responding with brute force, and killing peaceful protesters.  At least 50 protesters have been killed and 413 injured since the protests started on 18 June, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. Kenya's main opposition leader Raila Odinga has expressed solidarity with the protesters, saying there had to be justice for victims before any talks with the government could take place. Mr Odinga's position could undermine Mr Ruto's attempt to include members of the opposition in his cabinet - a move which the hopes will help end the youth-led protests.

604,Why did it take 29 days to find Jay Slater?,"Just over a month ago, you probably hadn't heard of Jay Slater. He was a teenager on a first holiday without his parents in Tenerife, like so many Brits this summer. Sometimes accidents happen while abroad and occasionally they become tragedies. Few ever hear about them. Not for Jay, 19, whose family have been thrust into a national spotlight during a month-long search that has captivated millions of people on social media. Yet the facts in Jay's case now seem relatively simple. He got lost in treacherous terrain and fell to his death. His family hoped the viral frenzy would end when his body was found last week. But it did not. Many are now asking one question: why did it take 29 days to find him? We’ve spent time in Tenerife over the past month inside the search for Jay, reporting on the riddle. What we've seen raises both questions and answers. Things went wrong for Jay in the early hours of 17 June. He decided to get into a car with two men in Playa de Las Americas, the heart of the Spanish island's nightlife. Those men, reportedly British nationals, drove the apprentice bricklayer about 22 miles (36km) north to an Airbnb in the village of Masca - a tiny settlement surrounded by mountains and ravines (they were later allowed to leave the island after being quickly ruled out of the investigation by Spanish police, the Guardia Civil). An immediate focus of the investigation became an image Jay posted on social media app Snapchat, cigarette in hand, tagged at the door of the apartment at 07:30 BST. It showed he had stayed at the Airbnb. Then two phone calls emerged. His friend Lucy Law received one at around 08:30 BST. Jay told her he was lost, had 1% battery on his phone and needed water.  In a video call to fellow friend Brad Hargreaves, Jay was walking on rough, stony ground, saying he was trekking 11 hours home after missing a bus. How did he end up in the mountains?  Ofelia Medina Hernandez, who made the last sighting of him at around 08:00 BST, claims Jay asked about the next bus – 10:00 – but might not have understood the answer. He then walked. Whether further evidence exists to point to why Jay was up in the mountains, or why he wandered into such dangerous terrain in that window until he was reported missing at 09:00 BST, is unclear. Investigators have seemingly been unable to answer this.  If a coroner in the UK decides to hold an inquest, more detail might emerge publicly. Thanks to Jay's phone pinging a mast at 08:50 BST, Spanish police had a location to work off: the Rural de Teno park. Search teams sprang into action on difficult terrain. It's an area of thick vegetation, steep ravines and cliff-faces. Weather conditions lurch between 30C heat and sudden drops in both temperature and visibility as mist rolls in from the sea. In the snippets of information shared with the media, Guardia Civil press officers referred to specialist sniffer dog teams from Madrid, helicopter crews and drones scouring the rough terrain. Fast forward to last week, and human remains were found in the ravine close to the phone mast. The police found the body, not the various external search teams and TikTokers who joined in.  Through fingerprint testing, it was confirmed by the police and Canary Islands Higher Court of Justice to be Jay. His injuries were consistent with a fall onto rocky ground from height. Days of searches of this area had found nothing.  Did they unwittingly walk past him first time around? The Guardia Civil have declined to answer any questions about this. They told us journalists that ""we don't give details of the investigation"". What few knew until now beyond a tight-knit circle in Tenerife, was that after the police formally called off the search two weeks in, it actually continued. It appears the Guardia Civil may have hoped that announcing they had stopped searching would calm some of the attention around the case - as the search had certainly not ended. Out of view of the main paths and trails around Masca, in an area called Juan Lopez, mountaineers with machetes had been abseiling into inaccessible areas and hacking away at vegetation. The Guardia Civil said it carried out ""discreet"" searches to deter ""curious onlookers"". Questions remain as to whether this was the best strategy. Perhaps an approach more aligned to British police in missing person's searches where constant updates are provided for transparency, could have prevented some of the wild conspiracies. It is a question that Lancashire Police also had to grapple with during a similar torrent of interest that dominated the search for Nicola Bulley in Lancashire, just 24 miles (38km) from Jay's hometown of Oswaldtwistle. While searches were ongoing, on TikTok, Instagram reels, X and Facebook, fantastical tales of Moroccan mafia groups or international drug smuggling rings were woven in with information from Jay's past. His family endured outright lies and content such as fake recordings of screams suggesting he had been murdered. Jay's mum Debbie was hit with messages from people claiming they had kidnapped her son. Rachel Hargreaves, Brad's mother, who flew to Tenerife along with Debbie, tried to manage the flood of comments and messages on the family's official Facebook group. She soon became a target herself, telling the BBC that some anonymous trolls had created a fake account in the name of her late mother. At one stage, Debbie herself posted in one unofficial Facebook group dedicated to Jay Slater ""theories"", begging for some compassion. A flood of negative comments and cynicism followed. For Jay's family, the next priority is getting his body home. Matthew Searle, chief executive of missing person's charity LBT Global, told the BBC the paperwork should be complete in about a week - though he indicated that the exact arrangements would be kept under wraps to protect the family's privacy. Even now, it appears that amateur sleuths and trolls are trying to intervene in the process of flying his body home. Some people are searching online for autopsy results. If an inquest is opened in the UK it could see witnesses, such as the men who were in the Airbnb with Jay, called to give evidence and answer questions.  With the evidence pointing to an accidental fall, the coroner might certify the cause of death without an inquest. The family's wishes will also be considered, though. The disappearance and death of their ""beautiful boy"", a ""living nightmare"" as his family put it, will leave deep scars for the whole family and Jay's many friends. But so too the baffling ordeal of being the victims of social media at its very worst. Maybe this is the new norm for the modern age of high-profile missing person's cases, posing a challenge to police forces in the years to come. Back in Oswaldtwistle, the people who knew Jay hope this chapter of the story, at least, is over.

603,Fined for yellow and blue shoes: How Russian laws smother dissent,"Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia.  For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution. The repressive nature of the punishments, often disproportionate to the offence, harks back to the methods of the old Soviet Union. The law used most widely against critics of the war in Ukraine is the criminal offence of spreading ""deliberately false information"" about the Russian army. It was rushed through parliament shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was ""urgently needed because of the absolutely unprecedented information war waged against our country"". According to prominent Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 300 people have since been charged or convicted under it. Even though the law mentions ""false"" information, it has been used against people  who highlight crimes that are well-documented but denied by Russia. Ilya Yashin is one of the most high-profile critics of the war to be convicted under this law. The former head of a Moscow disctrict council was given eight and half years in jail for a live stream on YouTube in which he urged an investigation into the murder of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading ""false information"" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools. The law has also been applied to Russians with far smaller public profiles. Russian-language tutor Raisa Boldova, 61, was handed a suspended one-year community service sentence for posting critical comments about attacks on civilians in Ukraine, including the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital.  In an echo of a chilling Soviet practice of confining dissidents to mental hospitals, the court also ordered her to undergo a compulsory psychiatric evaluation. Another recent law penalises ""discrediting"" the Russian army, and it has been applied to a broad variety of actions interpreted either as support for Ukraine or criticism of the war. These include: A village priest in Kostroma region was fined for discrediting Russia's armed forces after praying for peace and mentioning the sixth commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"". Russia's ""foreign agents"" law allows restrictions to be imposed on critics without convicting them of any wrongdoing.  Individuals or organisations that have criticised or scrutinised government policies are targeted if they are deemed to have received money from abroad - even from a relative - or merely to be under ""foreign influence"". The label has to be attached to all public communications, a practice designed to undermine trust in them and one that resembles the Soviet practice of branding dissidents ""enemies of the people"". Among Russia's ""foreign agents"" are election monitor Golos, prominent pollster Levada Centre, rights group OVD-Info, a movement of wives of mobilised soldiers called The Way Home and numerous independent news websites and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov. Books written by so-called foreign agents have started to disappear from shops and libraries. A ""foreign agent"" label can make life difficult – but being declared ""undesirable"" amounts to an outright ban. All manner of organisations have been banned from Russia in this way – from the NGO Greenpeace to London-based think-tank Chatham House, as well as a number of key Russian media outlets. Late opposition leader Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation was disbanded after being declared “extremist” – another label used to effectively erase individuals and organisations from public life.  Navalny himself was handed a lengthy prison sentence and died in jail in February 2024. His widow says he was killed by President Putin. Several of Navalny's lawyers were themselves arrested on charges of extremism. In Russia, anyone who wishes to hold a demonstration needs permission from the authorities. If the rally is critical of the government, that is practically impossible. ""One-person pickets"" are allowed, but many are regularly shut down - ostensibly because of Covid restrictions. One man was fined for wearing blue-and-yellow shoes - seen as a violation of laws regulating political demonstrations. And a journalist from Vologda Region, Antonida Smolina, was visited by police after someone complained about photographs she had posted online showing her posing in a yellow coat against a blue sky. Other actions outlawed in Russia include ""disrespect"" for the authorities and calls for sanctions to be imposed on the country. According to Natalia Prilutskaya of Amnesty International, the Kremlin uses laws to “legitimise repression”, partly by exploiting the vague wording of some Russian laws. ""This vagueness allows law enforcement structures to qualify basically any activity as a forbidden activity, or at least it makes it easier,"" Ms Prilutskaya told the BBC. Dmitrii Anisimov, spokesman for Russian human rights group OVD-Info, argues that laws are a particularly important for the Kremlin because of the way Russia's security apparatus functions. ""The Russian security community is fairly bureaucratic and it needs legal norms for their actions,” he said. Legislation used by the security services had been “deliberately designed in a way that makes their application simple and widespread”, he added. Ms Prilutskaya says it all adds up to a general climate of repression, which she blames on President Vladimir Putin. ""The ambitions of one person have brought Russia to the edge of a really deep abyss,” she said.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4yv7nv8xlo,"Vitaly Shevchenko,",2024-07-21 00:10:19,
602,Afghanistan - wish you were here? The Taliban do,"When it comes to planning a holiday, Afghanistan is not at the top of most people’s must-visit lists. Decades of conflict mean that few tourists dared step foot in the Central Asian nation since its heyday as part of the hippie trail in the 1970s. And the future of whatever tourism industry had survived was thrust into further uncertainty by the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. But a quick scroll through social media suggests that not only has tourism survived, it has - in its own, extraordinarily niche way - boomed. “Five reasons why Afghanistan should be your next trip,” gush the delighted influencers, their cameras sweeping across glistening lakes, through mountainous passes and into colourful, busy markets. “Afghanistan hasn’t been this safe in 20 years,” others declare, posing next to the vast chasms left behind by the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas more than 20 years ago. Behind the sunny claims and glamorous videos are questions about the risks these travellers are taking, and exactly who this burgeoning industry is truly helping: a population struggling to survive, or a regime keen to shift the narrative in its favour? “It is very ironic to see those videos on TikTok where there is a Taliban guide and Taliban official giving tickets to tourists to visit the [site of the] destruction of the Buddhas,” points out Dr Farkhondeh Akbari, whose family fled Afghanistan during the first Taliban regime in the 1990s. “These are the people who destroyed the Buddhas.” The list of countries visited by Sascha Heeney do not, on first hearing, sound like ideal holiday destinations - places many will be more used to reading about in the news. But then, that appears to be exactly why Heeney, and thousands more like her across the globe, picked them out: off the beaten track, as far away from a five-star resort as you can get - and therefore, almost entirely unique. So perhaps it is not surprising she was won over by Afghanistan. “It is just raw,” says the part-time travel guide from Brighton, UK. “You don’t get much rawer than there. That can be attractive - if you want to see real life.” What do the Taliban get out of it? After all, they have a reputation for being deeply suspicious, hostile even, towards outsiders, particularly Westerners. And yet here they are, posing - if slightly uncomfortably - alongside the tourists, guns on show, their bearded faces potentially about to go viral on TikTok (banned in the country since 2022). At one level, the answer is simple. The Taliban - largely isolated internationally, under widespread sanctions and prevented from accessing funds given to Afghanistan's former government - need money.  The tourists - whose numbers have crept up from just 691 in 2021 to more than 7,000 last year, according to AP news agency - bring it.  Most seem to join one of myriad tours offered by international companies, providing a peek at the ""real Afghanistan"" for a few thousand dollars a trip. Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Taliban government's Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said earlier this year that he dreamed of the country becoming a tourist hotspot. In particular, he revealed, he was eyeing up the Chinese market - all with the backing “of the Elders”. “All they want to do [with tourism], it’s good,” says Afghan tour guide Rohullah, whose smiling face has been shared dozens of times by happy clients since he started leading groups three years ago. “Tourism creates a lot of jobs and opportunities,” he adds – and he should know. After what he refers to as “the change” in 2021 - when the Taliban seized power as the US pulled out - he was offered a job as a tour guide by a friend. Before that, he had spent eight years working for the Afghan finance ministry. And he hasn’t regretted it. Tour groups like Heeney's need drivers and local guides, and with tourist numbers continuing to rise, there is no shortage of work.  It is not surprising then to find groups of young men - and they are all men - attending Taliban-approved hospitality classes in Kabul, hoping to take advantage of the burgeoning industry. “We expect much for this year,” Rohullah says. “This is a peaceful time - it was not possible to travel to all parts of Afghanistan before, but for now, it really is possible.” The killing of three Spanish tourists and an Afghan at a market in Bamiyan in May by the Islamic State-affiliated ISK militant group stood out for being unusual because it targeted foreigners.  The British Foreign Office continues to advise against all travel to the country, which remains a target for attacks. ISK carried out 45 in 2023 alone, according to the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. Of course, part of the reason for Afghanistan's increased security now is that during the 20 year war which engulfed the country after the US invasion, the Taliban themselves were responsible for much of the violence. Take - for example - the first three months of 2021,  when the UN attributed more than 40% of the 1,783 civilian casualties recorded to the Taliban. It wasn't just the Taliban though. The same report noted US-led Afghan government forces were responsible for 25% of the casualties in the same period. What is perhaps more surprising is that Heeney and two other members of the group she led for Lupine Tours earlier this year were women - and they were far from the only ones. Young Pioneer Tours - which has long experience of organising holidays to North Korea and other off-grid destinations - even runs exclusively female trips to Afghanistan. Rohullah has guided female solo travellers “without any issues”. The Taliban’s strict rules for their own female population - which has seen them forced out of the workplace, out of secondary education and even out of the Band-e-Amir national park, a stop on many of the international tours on offer - do not preclude female tourists visiting. It does mean that “women and men have different encounters” in Afghanistan, acknowledges Rowan Beard, who has been bringing groups to the country since 2016. It is not necessarily a bad thing, he argues. “Men cannot speak with women; women can,” he explains. “Our female tourists had the opportunity to sit with a group of women and hear from them about their experiences, and further insights into the country."" But everyone needs to follow the rules put in place. Heeney and her group were briefed in advance of what would be required in order to meet those rules, including on how they dressed, how to act and who they could, and couldn’t, talk to.  The Taliban - ever-present, watching from the sidelines with their guns - were among those who did not speak to Heeney or the female members of her group. She didn't begrudge it. “You have to kind of know the rules and learn the game,” she explains. For Heeney, speaking with the women - who were “incredibly happy” the group was visiting - was a highlight on a tour where the ""absolutely lovely"", generous and welcoming people of Afghanistan stood out. In videos posted on social media, the women are noticeably missing from vibrant street scenes - a fact glossed over by one visitor, who declares people shouldn’t worry, they are just inside doing what women around the world love to do: shop. Watching these slick videos from outside Afghanistan, some are left with a bitter taste. “[Tourists think] it is just this backward part of the world, and they can do whatever they want - we don’t care,"" says Dr Akbari, now a postdoctoral researcher at Monash University in Australia. ""We just go and enjoy the landscape and get our views and our likes. And this hurts us a lot.” It is, she adds, “unethical tourism with a lack of political and social awareness”, which allows the Taliban to gloss over the realities of life now they are back in power. Because this is, arguably, the other value of tourism to the Taliban: a new image. One which doesn't highlight the rules controlling the lives of Afghan women. “My family - they have no male guardian - cannot travel from one district to another district,” Dr Akbari points out. “We are talking about 50% of the population who have no rights… We are talking about a regime which has installed gender apartheid. “And yes, there is a humanitarian crisis: I’m happy that tourists might go and buy something from a shop and it might help a local family, but what is the cost of it? It is normalising the Taliban regime.” Heeney admits she did have a “moral struggle” over the Taliban’s position on women before she visited. “Of course, I feel very strongly about their rights - it crossed my mind,” she says. “But then as a traveller… I think countries are deserving to go to, and be listened to - we have a skewed idea. I like to see with my own eyes. I can make my own judgment.” Beard argues for letting people “make their own conclusions rather than there being a one-size-fits-all answer to the experience women have in the country”. The overly positive view shared by some on social media can definitely be seen as problematic, says Marina Novelli, professor of marketing and tourism at Nottingham University School of Business. “I would be very wary of the sensationalisation of a destination,” she says, explaining that some may “paint an image that is naïve”. “Sometimes travellers also want to send a positive message - but that does not mean that problems [aren’t still there].” Boycotting is also not the way forward, argues Prof Novelli, who sits on an international tourism ethics board. “I find that problematic - it isolates these countries even more.” It also opens up a question over where to draw the line - there are plenty of tourist destinations in the global north which have governments with questionable practices, she says. However, the potential for benefit is also worth considering: in Saudi Arabia, she says, a growing tourism industry has led to a widening role in society for women. “I think tourism can be a force for peace, for cross-cultural exchange,” Prof Novelli says. That potential though does not make it easier for women like Dr Akbari, and her family and friends in Afghanistan. “Our pains and our sufferings are being whitewashed,"" she says, ""brushed with these fake strokes of security the Taliban want.""",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv223yvnp9mo,"Flora Drury,",2024-07-20 23:10:19,
606,‘I wanted my clitoris back’ –  FGM survivor opts for reconstructive surgery,"Warning: This story contains graphic descriptions of the practices involved in female genital mutilation Shamsa Sharawe has become infamous within the Somali community across the world for speaking out against female genital mutilation (FGM) . In a video to illustrate what happened to her vulva when she was aged six she cut off the petals of a rose with a razor blade and then stitched up what was left of the flower. The TikTok post went viral - with nearly 12 million views since it was shared 16 months ago. No Somali, even in the diaspora, talks openly about FGM - never mind the problems that can come with it like painful periods, the difficulty of urinating, the agony of having sex and the dangers and trauma of giving birth when one’s vulva (including the lips and clitoris) have been cut off and the vaginal opening has been narrowed to a tiny hole. This form of FGM - known as infibulation or “type three” - is what happens to most girls in Somalia as it is a commonly held belief that the cutting off their outer genitalia will guarantee their virginity. Women who do not undergo FGM are regarded by many in Somali society as having loose morals or a high sex drive, which risks ruining a family’s reputation. Yet the 31-year-old TikToker, who came to live in the UK in 2001 when her family fled Somalia's civil war, is not afraid to take on such taboos with humorous, engaging and sometimes heart-breaking honesty. Using the name Shamsa Araweelo on TikTok, she has shared a horrific account of how she was forcibly married off and raped not long after she turned 18 while on a trip to Somalia. It took six months for her to find a way to escape back to the UK. But perhaps the biggest taboo of all has been to admit that she wanted her genitalia back - so much so that she has paid to have reconstructive surgery as it is not available to women through the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). She found out that this was possible when she was contacted by Haja Bilkisu, a German citizen who had undergone FGM as a child on a visit to her birth country of Sierra Leone. Responding to Ms Sharawe’s rose video, Ms Bilkisu explained that she had had her clitoris reconstructed thanks to Dr Dan mon O’Dey at Germany’s Luisenhospital in Aachen. “I was terrified of the idea of re-cutting, even though this time it was with my consent,” Ms Sharawe tells the BBC. “But I had to do it for my mental health. I just wanted to never feel pain again.” The surgery includes the reconstruction of the clitoris and labia - in Ms Sharawe’s case using tissue from her buttocks - and the removal of cysts and scar tissue in order to reduce pain and restore a woman’s sex life. In some instances, the vaginal opening is also enlarged back to normal. Ms Sharawe, who was featured in last year’s BBC list of 100 women for her determination to end FGM, decided to share her journey to Germany and recovery so other women like her could know their options. Yet it has taken years of abuse and the trauma of a second failed marriage for her to find the courage to take on the establishment within the Somali community. Ms Sharawe, now a single mother with a 10-year-old daughter, also feels let down by the NHS. It only offers deinfibulation for FGM survivors - that is surgery that opens up the vagina, but does not replace any removed tissue and will not undo any of the damage. Ms Sharawe decided to look for funds to pay for surgery in Germany. Through online crowdfunding, she managed to raise £25,000 ($32,000) – and underwent a four-and-half hour procedure in December. She was in Germany for three weeks and on her return, the anti-FGM activist and teaching assistant was not able to leave her house for months as she recovered. The childcare costs and other expenses on top of the surgery mean she is still in debt - owing around £3,000 to the hospital. “Paying for damage you didn't choose for yourself, or you didn’t create, is really unfair,” she says. There are four different types of FGM with varying levels of severity: In the past couple of decades, medical techniques have been developed to try to repair the damage - pioneered in 2004 by French surgeon Dr Pierre Foldès. Clitoral reconstruction is covered by public health insurance in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.  However, in Africa - where the majority of girls and women who have undergone FGM live - access to surgery is limited to Kenya, where patients must pay around £1,000, and Egypt, where non-governmental organisations can cover the costs. “Not every surgeon can do this surgery. It's complicated and every patient is different,” says Dr Adan Abdullahi, a specialist in Kenya. But he says women with every type of FGM could benefit: “It has a positive effect on childbirth, especially for ‘type three’, which is associated with a narrowing of the vagina.” Other issues, such as pain during sex, can be significantly improved or cured, he says - adding that his patients often experience improved self-esteem “and a sense of completeness”. Ms Bilkisu says she does feel more complete since her surgery, which was covered by the German health system: “Undergoing surgery was really a power move, a way to fight back.” But the 30-year-old recruitment agent encourages others to do their research thoroughly before deciding: ""Reconstruction is not only to reconstruct the clitoris. ""A lot of women who are cut have thick scar tissue. You have to discuss it with your doctor. What can you do to make the vulva more elastic?"" Ms Bilkisu, who was determined to have “a normal sexual experience” one day and autonomy over her body, has had three operations over the last three years - each one taking around six hours. “That's tough on your body. You're put under anaesthesia. You have to take medication afterwards. I couldn't walk for three weeks,” she says. The physical toll of such operations means some doctors, like Dr Reham Awwad in Egypt, are keen to promote non-surgical procedures. The co-founder of the Restore clinic says that although reconstruction surgery can bring relief, the cutting is sometimes so severe that even the most advanced surgical techniques cannot restore sexual function. ""I definitely don’t think surgery is the answer for everyone,"" she tells the BBC. Around half the cases at her clinic, which opened in 2020, are now treated using non-surgical means like injections of platelet-rich plasma which promotes tissue rejuvenation. ""The plasma [can] lead to regeneration and stimulation of increased blood flow and reducing inflammation in the areas where you inject it,"" she says. However, she cautions that the high cost means such treatments are beyond the reach of many. Her clinic also offers psychological therapies to overcome trauma for women cut at an age when they can remember the experience. For those who do opt for reconstructive surgery, the results can be emotional. “The first time I actually saw my clitoris I was taken aback because for me it was like this doesn't belong to me,” said Ms Bilkisu, who was eight years old when she underwent “type two” FGM. Ms Sharawe agrees it takes some getting used to, plus learning how to deal with things like proper period bleeds. It will take her another six months to completely recover - and she has not been able to afford to go back to Germany for a check-up, which worries her. “But now I know how it feels to be a full woman… I am a very happy woman,” she says. “I can wear underwear without discomfort or pain. I can wear trousers. I feel normal.” And while she has experienced an expected backlash from some Somalis on social media - some of her family have surprised her with their support. One of her uncles even wanted to know if the surgery was available in the UK for his wife. “He didn’t feel comfortable knowing his wife’s FGM was still affecting her even after 50-plus years. He wanted to improve the quality of her life... because we [all] deserve to have a good quality of life.” If you've been affected by issues raised in this story, sources of support are available via the BBC Action Line Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

608,Malaysia tracks down missing oil tanker which fled after collision,"Malaysia says it has intercepted a large oil tanker that was involved in a collision with another ship before fleeing the scene and turning off its tracking system.   The coastguard says it has located and detained Ceres I, sailing under the flag of São Tomé and Príncipe, and two tugboats that were towing the vessel off the country's eastern coast. The ship had collided with the Singapore-flagged Hafnia Nile on Friday, causing both ships to catch fire.  Officials in Singapore say all crew members from both ships were rescued. Malaysia's coastguard said Ceres I had left the location immediately after the collision that caused a blaze and injured at least two crew members. The incident happened about 55 km northeast of the Singaporean island of Pedra Branca, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said. The head of Malaysian coast guard's search and rescue team, Zin Azman Mohamad Yunus, has not explained why the São Tomé and Príncipe-flagged tanker tried to flee, but added that further investigations would be carried out.  The authorities in Singapore said after around 40 crew members were rescued from the blazing ships, around 26 of them remained on Ceres I to tackle the fire.  The Singapore-flagged Hafnia Nile, was reportedly carrying naphtha, a highly flammable type of petroleum.   The cause of the collision is still unclear. Singapore maritime authorities said ship traffic in the busy waterway was unaffected. However, Malaysian coastguard officials found an oil spill covering around 17 square kilometres. Ceres I is a large crude oil carrying  supertanker. Some reports suggests it could be part of a so-called  'dark fleet', carrying oil from countries under sanctions. A market intelligence service, S&P Global Commodities at Sea, says the ship, operated by China's Shanghai Prosperity Ship Management, has previously carried Iranian crude, which is subject to US sanctions.",2024-07-21 23:10:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047jm8984mo,"Lipika Pelham,",2024-07-21 21:10:19,
614,CrowdStrike and Microsoft: What we know about global IT outage,"A massive tech failure has caused travel chaos around the world, with banking and healthcare services also badly hit. Flights have been grounded because of the IT outage - a flaw which left many computers displaying blue error screens. There were long queues, delays and flight cancellations at airports around the world, as passengers had to be manually checked in. Cyber-security firm CrowdStrike has admitted that the problem was caused by an update to its antivirus software, which is designed to protect Microsoft Windows devices from malicious attacks. Microsoft has said it is taking ""mitigation action"" to deal with ""the lingering impact"" of the outage. Here is a summary of what we know so far. This is still a little unclear.  CrowdStrike is known for producing antivirus software, intended to prevent hackers from causing this very type of disruption. According to CrowdStrike boss George Kurtz, the issues are only impacting  Windows PCs and no other operating systems, and were caused by a defect in a recent update. ""The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,"" he said. ""This is not a security incident or cyber-attack."" What exactly was wrong with the update is yet to be revealed, but as a potential fix involves deleting a single file, it is possible that just one rogue file could be at the root of all the mayhem. It could be some time. CrowdStrike's Mr Kurtz, speaking to NBC News, said it was the firm's ""mission"" to make sure every one of its customers recovered completely from the outage. ""We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our companies,"" he said. He has since told CNBC that while some systems can be fixed quickly, for others it ""could be hours, could be a bit longer"". CrowdStrike has issued its fix. But according to those in the know, it will have to be applied separately to each and every device affected. Computers will require a manual reboot in safe mode - causing a massive headache for IT departments everywhere. Something important to note here, is that personal devices like your home computer or mobile phone are unlikely to have been affected - this outage is impacting businesses. Microsoft is advising clients to try a classic method to get things working - turning it off and on again - in some cases up to 15 times. The tech giant said this has worked for some users of virtual machines – PCs where the computer is not in the same place as the screen. “Several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,"" it said. It is also telling customers with more in-depth computing knowledge that they should delete a certain file - the same solution one CrowdStrike employee has been sharing on social media. But this fix is intended for experts and IT professionals, not regular users. The problems have emerged across the world, but were first noticed in Australia, and possibly felt most severely in the air travel industry, with more than 3,300 flights cancelled globally. Meanwhile, the problems have also hit payment systems, banking and healthcare providers around the world. Railway companies, including Britain’s biggest which runs Southern, Thameslink, Gatwick Express and Great Northern, warned passengers to expect delays. In Alaska, the 911 emergency service was affected, while Sky News was off air for several hours on Friday morning, unable to broadcast. The outage might also impact people getting paid on time. Melanie Pizzey, head of the Global Payroll Association, told PA news agency that she'd been contacted by ""numerous clients"" who couldn't access their payroll software. She said the outage could mean firms are unable to process staff payments this week, but there may be a knock-on effect too. ""We could see a backlog with regard to processing payrolls for the coming month end, which may delay employees from receiving their monthly wage,"" she said. If you're worried about your own, personal devices, we have some good news. The software at the centre of this outage is generally used by businesses, which means that most people's personal computers won't be impacted. That means if you're wondering whether you need to delete a certain file to avoid your computer restarting constantly, the simple answer is no, you don't. It's a reminder of the complexity of our modern digital infrastructure that CrowdStrike, a company that's not exactly a household name, can be at the heart of such worldwide disarray. The US firm, based in Austin, Texas, is a listed company on the US stock exchange, featuring in both the S&P 500 and the high-tech Nasdaq indexes. Like a lot of modern technology companies, it hasn't been around that long. It was founded a mere 13 years ago, but has grown to employ nearly 8,500 people. As a provider of cyber-security services, it tends to get called in to deal with the aftermath of hack attacks. It has been involved in investigations of several high-profile cyber-attacks, such as when Sony Pictures had its computer system hacked in 2014.  But this time, because of a flawed update to its software, a firm that is normally part of the solution to IT problems has instead caused one. In its last earnings report, CrowdStrike declared a total of nearly 24,000 customers. That's an indication not just of the size of the issue, but also the difficulties that could be involved in fixing it. Each of those customers is a huge organisation in itself, so the number of individual computers affected is hard to estimate.

615,The Spanish fightback against record tourism,"If you can elbow your way onto one of Majorca’s sunspots this summer, you will witness two unstoppable forces. The first, as old as time, the waves of the Balearic Sea, methodically erasing the day’s lovingly crafted sandcastles. The second, a more modern phenomenon, the tsunami of tourism threatening to consume all in its path. Every inch of beach is taken. Finding a parking space is like striking gold.  If you leave your sunbed for too long, your possessions are unceremoniously turfed to make space for the long queue of would-be usurpers. All these are the signs of a bonanza that’s seen and heard across the island, not least in the incessant beeping of contactless payment machines ringing out from the teeming hotels, restaurants and bars. A chorus of commerce powered by record numbers of visitors. But if this is a tale of colossal wealth being showered onto a business-savvy Spanish community, Sonia Ruiz certainty has not shared any of it. We meet the mother of one, 31, in a park a few hundred metres from the shore in the capital, Palma. Her four-year-old son Luca negotiates the various playground slides with no apparent concern. But Sonia is really struggling. Her landlord has asked them to leave and she says finding a new place is impossible. “Every day I’m looking and every day the rent is higher,” she says. “I even stop people in the street and ask if they have something because the day is approaching when I will have to leave the apartment, and I just see me and my son homeless because there is absolutely nothing.” Sonia and her partner are separated but have been forced to live together because individually they cannot afford the cost of rent, despite taking home 2,400 euros a month between them. “They ask you for deposits of several months. Some have even told me that they don't want children, they don't want animals. And so many people are looking.” Like thousands of Majorcans, Sonia is protesting this weekend against the surge in tourism that is being blamed for plummeting living standards among the local population. Activists say spiralling housing costs are being driven by a huge number of houses and apartments being bought by foreigners, or at least rented out to them for large chunks of the summer. “It’s impossible to sustain this sort of model,"" 25-year-old Pere Joan Femenia explains from outside the cathedral in Majorca’s capital, Palma. He is part of a movement called ""Menys Turisme, Més Vida"", or ""Less Tourism, More Life"". He says not only are unprecedented numbers of visitors pricing locals out of the housing market, they are also using up public spaces, public services and natural resources. Pere started his activism five years ago as part of Greta Thunberg’s climate movement, but his focus has shifted to the cost of living for his fellow islanders. “Businesses are changing from one's selling traditional products to multi-nationals selling ice cream and we are losing our identity. We want to preserve our culture,"" he says.  Pere points over to the port, far beyond the rows of street vendors and swelling crowds filling the square, explaining that some cruises disgorge as many of 12,000 visitors every day onto the island. He says it is a myth that Majorca needs ever-expanding tourism to survive, and that the reality is many locals are preparing to leave for good because they can no longer afford it here. Pere argues that putting limits on flights arriving and cruises docking will immediately ease the pressure on the island. It is a demand that will form part of the slogans and banners carried around Palma during this weekend’s protest. Spain’s National Institute of statistics says last year 14.4 million foreign tourists visited the Balearic Islands, of which Majorca is by far the biggest - followed by Menorca then Ibiza. The institute says the number of international visitors to the archipelago increased by 9.1% compared with 2022 while their spending went up even more - 16.4%. When Spanish visitors are taken into account too, activists claim this year could see 20 million visitors to the Balearics. As Spain’s tourist hotspots have developed over the decades, the debate over whether the millions of visitors bring more problems than benefits has intensified. This year it feels like something has changed. The anger among many locals is reaching a new level - notably demonstrated in Barcelona recently when visitors were drenched with water pistols. There have been demonstrations elsewhere on the mainland, in Malaga, as well as in the Canary Islands. Spain’s tourist magnets are now looking to repel a seemingly inexorable deluge. Some British newspapers compiled lists of “hostile holiday hotspots” to avoid in the summer of 2024. On a packed beach in Magaluf, the long-time destination of choice for millions of British holidaymakers, the Green family from Rotherham are paddling happily. This is dad Adam’s first trip abroad, although calling it a “holiday” may be a stretch as he and his wife keep tabs on their seven kids. “It’s hectic, but we’re getting there. Apart from the heat, it’s great” he says. I ask whether they’ve heard about the various protests that have been taking place and if it made them think twice about coming out to Majorca. “I saw a little bit on the news”, says Charlotte, “but I tried not to watch it because I didn’t want it to stress me out and put me off coming because we’d already booked and paid for it.” And how about the central thrust of the local protesters’ argument - that burgeoning tourism is having a hugely negative impact? “Don’t the tourists boost it and make the money for this place?"" asks Adam. “People travel around the world and this is it. With no tourists there’d be no jobs, no wages, no nowt. They rely on it, don’t they?” You can get in touch via this link",2024-07-21 23:10:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99wxwgzn8qo,"Nick Beake,",2024-07-21 00:10:20,
616,"Conspiracy theories swirl about geo-engineering, but could it help save the planet?","If we can’t control rising global temperatures by drastically cutting carbon emissions, could something called geo-engineering be a way to cool the planet? In what is already a £103bn ($135bn) industry, scientists around the world, including in the UK, are researching geo-engineering - ways of manipulating the climate to tackle global warming. Some experts are concerned there are too many risks associated with it, fearing it could mess with global weather patterns or actually warm some regions, not cool them. As the industry grows, so have conspiracy theories. BBC Weather has seen a large increase in social media comments around geo-engineering since January, accusing us of covering up secret projects and wrongly blaming geo-engineering for the cool and wet weather we’ve recently had. Worldwide, there have been twice as many mentions of geo-engineering this year on X, formerly known as Twitter, than over the last six months of 2023. Some geo-engineering ideas include reflecting sunlight back out to space to cool Earth. The most advanced area of geo-engineering is direct air carbon capture with small-scale facilities in operation across Europe, the US and Canada. These currently remove around 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year (one third of London’s annual emissions), meaning it would need massively scaling up to make any difference to the roughly 35 billion tonnes we emit globally. “We need to start to think about other things that we can do in order to limit any further warming,” says Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society. “That’s where geo-engineering starts to become an interesting discussion.” Aside from fears about exacerbating the effects of climate change, some experts are worried it’s tempting to see geo-engineering as a quick fix that could also distract us from efforts to reduce carbon emissions. It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but the idea of reflecting solar radiation, the technical term for sunlight, is not as crazy as it might sound and sometimes happens in the natural world. During volcanic eruptions, huge amounts of ash and aerosols - tiny particles - can be transported into the high atmosphere which can then reflect solar radiation back into space. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 led to the average global temperature cooling by 0.5C over the following couple of years. So, could we really replicate a volcano to cool our planet? Professor Jim Haywood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Exeter, urges caution. “I really want to know about the detrimental impacts of climate change, but also about the potential side-effects and detrimental impacts of any solar radiation management deployments,” he said. Researchers are studying two kinds of solar radiation management: marine cloud brightening and stratospheric aerosol injection. Marine cloud brightening involves spraying very fine saltwater from a boat towards low-level clouds above the ocean to enhance their brightness and reflectivity. Modelling has shown that if you were to spray a large area - around 4% of the ocean - near the equator and brighten clouds, the combination of more cloud and consequently a lower sea surface temperature beneath it could have worldwide impacts. Our atmosphere is complex, has no borders and behaves like a fluid. You may have come across the ‘butterfly effect’ where if a butterfly were to flutter its wings in Mexico, it can bring rain to the UK. While in reality that is a big leap, it highlights how weather is connected all over the world. “Brightening the cloud off the coast of Namibia could induce drought over South America and particularly Brazil. What's in Brazil? Well, the rainforests,” Prof Haywood said. In this instance, because of complex atmospheric and ocean circulations, increasing the cloud brightness would cool the sea surface in the eastern south Atlantic, which means the rainfall pattern would be negatively disrupted across the south Atlantic towards South America. Drought in the Amazon rainforest - often referred to as the ‘lungs of the planet’ as they absorb carbon dioxide - could cause considerable damage. While there is focus on using marine cloud brightening to offset global temperature rise, some see an opportunity to use it on a much smaller scale. After a mass coral bleaching event in 2016 in the Great Barrier Reef, scientists at Southern Cross University in Australia have been conducting cloud brightening trials to shield and cool the very coral-rich areas of the reef to prevent bleaching during marine heatwaves. “While we are in the early stages in understanding how marine cloud brightening might be applied over the Great Barrier Reef, we have made major scientific advancements. ""We have greatly increased our confidence that clouds over the reef can be brightened,” Professor Daniel Harrison, the project lead from Southern Cross University said. The technology to perform marine cloud brightening on a small scale with fans and sprayers already exists, but the other method of solar radiation management - stratospheric aerosol injection - would need greater advances to have the desired impact. This method of geo-engineering involves artificially adding aerosols such as sulphate into the stratosphere, which extends from 6-12 miles (10-20km) to 31 miles (50km) above the Earth. These aerosols would reflect some solar radiation, reducing the amount reaching our planet’s surface and theoretically cause a global cooling.  How enough aerosol could be injected into the stratosphere is uncertain but planes capable of flying at an altitude of 11 miles (18km) - around 1.5 times higher than commercial aircraft can - are one suggestion. Millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide would need to be injected to have any impact. For example, during the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, the resulting half a degree of global cooling was the result of about 15 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide injected into the stratosphere. Because sulphate aerosols only last a couple of years in the atmosphere compared to the decades that carbon dioxide lasts, stratospheric aerosol injection is only seen as a short-term method. This hasn’t stopped one company in the US from starting to sell ‘cooling credits’. For a fee they will send a balloon filled with sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere, where it will burst and release the gas. They suggest that one of their cooling credits - two grams of sulphur dioxide - will “offset one tonne of carbon dioxide warming for one year”. That’s the equivalent of one passenger’s return flight between Paris and New York, which means a lot of balloons would need to be released for this to have any sort of cooling effect. As with marine cloud brightening, there are also risks with stratospheric aerosol injection. In a study earlier this year, computer modelling found that stratospheric aerosol injection could cause strong warming 15km above the tropics which would change large-scale weather patterns, warming the polar regions and altering rainfall patterns over land. “The regional impacts are very much unknown,” Prof Bentley said. ”We may be able to mitigate global average temperature [rise], but we may actually make things worse in certain regions of the world”. This brings us to fundamental questions about the credibility and risks involved in this kind of intervention. In 2022, hundreds of scientists signed an open letter calling for a global non-use agreement on solar radiation management. They said increasing calls for development provided “cause for concern” with the dangers involved “poorly understood” and something that would act as a disincentive to governments, businesses and societies from decarbonising. The group worries that even doing theoretical research will lead to real-world experiments without fully knowing the downsides. But other scientists think the risk of investigating solar radiation management further is smaller than the risk of relying solely on decarbonisation. Additionally, some say that misinformation and conspiracists are preventing them from doing research. Dr Ramit Debnath, an assistant professor at the University of Cambridge, says “a lot of funders are very sceptical of funding research” because they are wary of being targeted by conspiracists. He has analysed almost 2 million tweets with the hashtag #GeoEngineering and found that over 70% expressed negative sentiments about solar radiation management with the majority tapping into conspiracies. One of these is to do with ‘chemtrails’, a widely debunked conspiracy theory about an alleged secret plot to spray people with dangerous chemicals, suggesting the white streaks in the sky that come out the back of planes is evidence of this. These are actually condensed water vapour trails - known as contrails - that come from the jet engines of planes. Contrails at this height actually absorb solar radiation and warm the planet and are therefore nothing to do with geo-engineering techniques currently being explored. Dr Debnath says that by so much as talking about solar radiation management on social media, he is accused of “trying to kill people and control people’s lives”. Solar radiation management is being treated with caution - the UK government hasn’t deployed the techniques and has “no plans to do so”. However, they are investing. The Natural Environment Research Council has invited applications for a £10.5m fund in order to “deliver ‘risk-risk analyses’” to assess whether the negative impacts of the technique are greater than the damage that would be caused by climate change. “It isn’t a silver bullet that’s going to solve everything,” said Prof Bentley. “But it possibly could be part of an array of solutions.” BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

617,In photos: Colonial India through the eyes of foreign artists,"A new exhibition in Delhi showcasing rare artworks by European artists gives insights into how the British ruled the country. Called Destination India: Foreign Artists in India, 1857-1947, the show focuses on artists who travelled to colonial India from around the world. The representation of India through the European and British artists has “long been a subject of intrigue and exploration”, writes Indian MP and author Shashi Tharoor, in an introduction to the show. “The fascination with India’s unique landscapes, grand monuments, vibrant traditions and rich history has drawn many to its shores, seeking to capture the essence of this multifaceted nation.” Mr Tharoor notes that the show is “refreshing and essential” as it explores the less-explored, yet a compelling period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, rather than just the early pioneers.  The exhibition showcases artworks, including from British artist William Carpenter, that give glimpses into not only the royal courts, but also daily life in the Empire.   Carpenter usually did watercolour, but this 1857 artwork, pictured above, is wood engraving on paper that depicts the busy back streets of Delhi's Jama Masjid (mosque). Many interesting artists visited India from England and other European countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were mainly conventional artists working in oil and watercolour and various print media. “They were attracted to the people, and not just to the grandees, but to ordinary people in the streets. If there was still an element of the picturesque, it was a more intimate and animated version of that aesthetic,” says Ashish Anand, managing director of DAG, a leading art firm which has put together the show.  “In their works we find an India – if we can put it this way – that we do not just see, but that we can hear and smell.” The work above is another watercolour painting of the Jama Masjid by William Simpson in 1864. Mainly a war artist, Simpson was sent to India in 1859 by a publishing company to illustrate the aftermath of the violent uprising two years earlier. Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, had in 1857 set off a rebellion against the British rule, often referred to as the first war of independence. Simpson's project halted when the publishing company went bankrupt. He called it the ""biggest disaster of my life"". Nonetheless, he continued travelling and sketching his expeditions across the sub-continent. This is a 1900 pastel portrait of elderly Indians by Olinto Ghilardi, an Italian artist. A significant European artist, Ghilardi shaped modern Indian art in the early 20th Century.  He mentored Abanindranath Tagore - nephew of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and founder of the Bengal School of Art, which shaped modern Indian painting. Ghilardi encouraged him to experiment with watercolours, gouache, and pastels, which he extensively used later in his work.  Ghilardi also served as the vice principal of the Government School of Art in Calcutta (now Kolkata). This 1896 painting of a young Indian woman was also made by Ghilardi. Not much is known about the life of the Italian painter before he arrived in Kolkata. His association with Tagore indicates his acceptance as an artist among Kolkata's Bengali elite. Much later, in 1911, Ghilardi became a prominent member of an avant-garde group of Italian artists. This is British artist Carlton Alfred Smith’s undated watercolour painting of a street scene in India. Smith lived in India between 1916 and 1923. He often painted landscapes along with portraits of people. A painter of the late Victorian period from Camden Town in London, Smith began as a lithographer before switching to painting. A member of the Royal Academy of Art, he's known for drawing interiors of cottages and the English countryside. This is a 1894 watercolour painting of Kashmir's Wular Lake by George Strahan, a British army engineer and artist. A gifted student from Surrey, Strahan joined the army and arrived in India in 1860, working in towns of Roorkee and Haridwar.  Two years later, he joined the Topographical Survey of India and started mapping central India, Rajasthan and the Himalayas. In 1888, he became superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, which mapped the Indian subcontinent.  At the Survey, Strahan drew relief maps before colour printing was introduced.  After retirement, he lived in the hills of Dehradun and travelled to Kashmir every summer. This is an 1887 watercolour of Hyderabad in southern India by German artist Woldemar Friedrich. A historical painter and illustrator, Friedrich spent much of his career teaching at prestigious German art academies. In the late 1880s, he travelled to India and created a series of landscapes and illustrations, published in the 1893 book ""Six Months in India"". Carpenter's 1857 wood engraving on paper artwork on Benaras (above) shows Varanasi - one of the world’s oldest cities and and India’s spiritual capital - brimming with life. Trained at the Royal Academy Schools in London, Carpenter became a renowned 19th-Century portrait and landscape painter.  Arriving in India in 1850, he travelled extensively, painting rulers, street scenes, landscapes, and locals across Bombay (now Mumbai), Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Kashmir, Lahore, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and Afghanistan. This is English artist Charles William Bartlett’s 1919 woodblock print on paper rendition of Punjab’s Golden Temple, a sacred shrine for Sikhs. Dover-born Bartlett was one of the world’s leading Japanese woodblock painters, and later switched to fine art. In 1913, he travelled to India, Indonesia and China. He designed 38 woodblock prints for his Japanese publisher from 1916 to 1925, including many scenes from his travels in South Asia. American artist Edwin Lord Weeks painted this colourful oil on canvas of a bullock-cart in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in 1882. Born in Boston to a wealthy family, Weeks was among the first American artists to visit India. His business family supported his artistic endeavours. Weeks first travelled to India between 1882 and 1883, painting places mainly in Rajasthan. He returned in 1886, when he visited at least seven cities. Known for his realist style and attention to detail, Weeks also wrote a travel account of his journeys through Persia (present day Iran) and India in 1896.",2024-07-21 23:10:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c28ejl4nvgyo,"Sudha G Tilak,",2024-07-21 01:10:20,
618,"Two down, two to go - Schauffele eyes slam after Open triumph","This video can not be played Schauffele wins The Open 2024 On the final day of an intense Open Championship, played out in a glorious amalgam of wind and rain and sunshine from first thing on Thursday, Xander Schauffele carried himself with the kind of zen that could make Buddha look fretful. The American said he got “chills” en route to the final green on Sunday, but it didn’t show. To the watching world he was impossibly cool and improbably collected.  He displayed a steely focus and a precision that laid waste to a pack that spent much of the day tightly bunched together, like a peloton awaiting a sprint finish. There was no sprint, though. There was a breakaway and nobody could go with it.   “It's an honour,” he said, looking at his Claret Jug. “I've always dreamt of doing it.  ""That walk up 18 truly is the coolest with the yellow leaderboards and the fans and the standing ovation. It really is one of the coolest feelings I've ever had in my life.” Schauffele holds off Rose to win Open at Troon 'No regrets' for Rose after Open dream falters in final holes The Open final leaderboard He talked of “super stressful moments” but that was part of Schauffele’s brilliance. Whatever emotion he was feeling, he never gave any hint of it.  Where did this round rate in the thousands he has played? “At the very tip top.” He called the back nine at Royal Troon the hardest nine holes he’s ever played and yet he mastered them in 31 shots. Four birdies and no bogeys on a stretch of holes that found out the greatest players on the planet all week. When Schauffele won his first major championship, the US PGA at Valhalla in May, his parents and, you sense, his greatest influences were far away from Louisville. When he won his second on Sunday they were right by his side.  His dad, Stefan, was in the media centre when his son did the winners’ news conference, standing away to the side and in a blindspot to the stage, so much so that Schauffele needed telling that his dad was present. Another major, but a different vibe.  When Schauffele won at Valhalla, his folks were at their place on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a cargo container that doubles as their oasis from life in San Diego. No running water, no air conditioning. Splendid isolation. Not an ideal spot to be when your boy has just fulfilled his life’s dream of winning a major, though. They followed it on their phone, which presented its own challenges, but it was emotional all the same.  “Once he made that putt [to win the PGA],"" said Stefan, “I started to melt like a piece of butter in a skillet.” This time, there would be no long-distance celebrations. Stefan and Ping Yi were here, as large as life. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Xander Schauffele's winning round Americans love their father-son stories in sport and the Schauffele yarn is up there with the best of them.  Stefan, who grew up in Germany, was a decathlete back in the day, an aspiring Olympian who had his own dream crushed when hit by a drunk driver at the age of 20. He lost the sight in an eye and experienced trauma in his life.  “There was some depression and alcoholism,” he said in a recent interview. “That’s what led me to moving to America.” He had a son and from the age of nine, Xander was a player. Stefan coached him and, from time to time, argued with him. Madly, on occasion.   Everything paid off. A golfing machine was forged and we saw it in all its formidable glory at Royal Troon this past week. “Now he’s got this first major,” said Stefan after Valhalla, “it’s the first one of the four [nobody in Team Schauffele is shying away from the target of a Grand Slam].  ""I’ve got a good feeling he’ll get the second one of the four this year. With him being as consistent as he is now, everybody is on notice.” Prescient words. For a number of years, Schauffele was deemed golf’s nearly man, a supremely talented player who couldn’t back up his excellence with titles.  This is his time now. Two majors in a single year is an other-worldly achievement in this era of the game, a period so full of established winners and thrusting young things who are utterly unafraid of winning. Schauffele said he had a chip on his shoulder about some of the negativity thrown at him. He used it as fuel.  What’s he going to use for motivation now that he’s an acclaimed double major winner? “If you look hard enough, you can always find it,” he said.   “It's something, when you feel like you need an extra kick in the butt, there's several easy ways to motivate yourself.  ""There's still a lot of things that I'd like to do in my career, and this is a very big leap towards that. The fire is still burning, maybe brighter than ever.” He has the Olympics in Paris next, a gold medal to defend from his glory in Tokyo, another dream to chase before returning to the majors circuit next year. That is terrain he will travel as a two-time champion and an increasing force to be reckoned with in the ferocious environment of elite golf.  Small in stature, for sure. But Schauffele is a colossus now.",2024-07-21 23:10:21,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cj50d114nrqo,Tom English,2024-07-21 21:10:21,
622,Pogacar seals third Tour de France with stage 21 win,"Tadej Pogacar previously won the Tour de France in 2020 and 2021 Tadej Pogacar sealed a sensational Tour de France-Giro d'Italia double by winning the stage 21 time trial into Nice. The UAE Team Emirates rider finished the Tour with a sixth stage victory and became the first man to win cycling's two biggest races in the same year since Italian Marco Pantani in 1998.  The Tour's finale was held outside of Paris for the first time since 1903 as the French capital prepares to host the Olympics. Wearing the yellow jersey Slovenia's Pogacar, 25, finished the stage 63 seconds clear of second-placed Jonas Vingegaard. The win secured his third Tour de France title, extending his lead over nearest rival and two-time winner Vingegaard, of Visma–Lease a Bike, to six minutes and 17 seconds. ""I cannot describe how happy I am,"" said Pogacar.   ""After two hard years in the Tour de France, this year everything went to perfection."" Tour debutant Remco Evenepoel, riding for Soudal–Quick-Step, finished third on the stage and completed the general classification podium, nine minutes and 18 seconds behind Pogacar. The 2024 edition will also be remembered for Mark Cavendish's record 35th stage victory in Saint Vulbas in the opening week. After completing the final stage, the legendary British sprinter said this year's Tour is likely to have been his last race. Tour de France 'likely' to be final race - Cavendish The African Tour de France cyclist racking up historic wins As well as two Grand Tours Pogacar has also won the Classics Liege–Bastogne–Liege and Strade Bianche this season Pogacar dominated this year's Tour de France - becoming the first rider to win six stages in a single edition since Cavendish in 2009. He also spent 19 days in the yellow jersey, holding it exclusively from stage four. This year's Tour was arguably won on stage 15 where, already ahead by almost two minutes, Pogacar stormed to victory on a gruelling climb up to Plateau de Beille to extend his lead over Vingegaard by another 69 seconds. Four days later he had overall victory wrapped up, ascending to Isola 2000 where he put a further one minute and 42 seconds into his nearest rivals. The Slovenian looked a level above Vingegaard, who he finished second behind at the last two editions, with the Dane still recovering from a broken collarbone and ribs suffered in April. But even a fully fit Vingegaard would have struggled to match Pogacar's pace. His Tour de France dominance matches his performance at this year's Giro d'Italia, where he blew away the competition to win by nine minutes and 56 seconds. ""Already it would have been an incredible year, but to win the Tour de France is another level,"" added Pogacar. ""To win both together is another level above that level."" In July Pogacar said he was ""99% sure"" he would not compete at this year's Vuelta a Espana, where he could become the first ever rider to win all three Grand Tours in the same calendar year. He will represent Slovenia in the men's road race at the Olympics in Paris on 3 August. Only Pogacar won more stages than Biniam Girmay in this year's race By finishing safely in Nice, sprinter Biniam Girmay made history - becoming the first black African winner of the Tour de France points classification. He had a sensational race. On day three he became the first Eritrean to win a stage at the Tour, and he went on to record two more victories - on stage eight and stage 12. The green jersey winner, 24, was one of only six black African riders in the top-level WorldTour peloton of 534 in 2023, the year he made his Tour de France debut. The 'African king' has battled through visa issues and loneliness since he moved to Europe six years ago. The King of the Mountains classification was won by Richard Carapaz while Belgian Evenepoel, 24, claimed the white jersey as the best rider in the general classification under the age of 25.

Humphries sealed victory by hitting double 20 twice in a 100 checkout as Van Gerwen threatened to reel him in. He is only the fourth man to win both events in the same year after Van Gerwen, Peter Wright and Phil Taylor. ""Honestly, I've felt more emotion than when I won the worlds.

Humphries beats Van Gerwen in gripping World Matchplay final Greaves wins Women's World Matchplay title Despite losing their past seven encounters, three-time champion Van Gerwen had vowed to ""teach a lesson"" to his opponent. Humphries, in his first World Matchplay final, averaged more than 104 - 11 better than his opponent - in the opening five legs but still went to the first break 3-2 down. He made his scoring power count with four consecutive legs to take control of the match and when Van Gerwen broke his throw, Humphries immediately hit back with a superb 141 checkout to take the 12th leg. The Dutchman upped his game, closed on the averages and finishes of 106 and 110 saw him level the contest at 12-12. Humphries fought back and took out 131 to go 16-13 ahead before Van Gerwen hit 160 and 108 checkouts to cut the deficit, but he missed four darts at the double when poised to level. He had three more chances again to take the next leg but Humphries finished in style with double double tops to clinch victory. ""I made mistakes and I still feel I was the better player.

620,Bashir 'showed the world what he can do' in England win,"This video can not be played Watch Bashir's five-wicket haul Captain Ben Stokes said Shoaib Bashir had ""shown the world what he can do"" after the off-spinner bowled England to victory in the second Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge. Bashir took 5-41 as the home side dismissed the tourists for 143 in the final session of the fourth day to win the match by 241 runs and claim an unassailable 2-0 series lead. At 20 years and 282 days, Bashir became the youngest England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a home Test and the first spinner to take five in an innings at Trent Bridge since 2006. ""He has got so much talent and he's got an unbelievable desire to get better,"" said Stokes. ""It's really good for a young guy to put in a performance that wins England a Test. He was pretty emotional at the end. It's a pretty cool day for him."" Bashir was a surprise choice for England's winter tour of India - called up after playing only six first-class matches. However, he has now taken three five-wicket hauls in five Tests, and in one of those matches - the heavy defeat of West Indies in the first Test at Lord's last week - he was not required to bowl. England dismantle Windies to win Test and series Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Bashir bags five as England win emphatically ""He has shown the world what he can do,"" added Stokes. ""His intent is to always take wickets and never just to hold an end up."" England have opted for Bashir over Jack Leach, despite the latter being first-choice for their county Somerset. Bashir even had to spend time on loan with Worcestershire earlier this summer in order to play in the County Championship. Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum have identified Bashir’s height as one of his key attributes. At 6ft 4in, Bashir says he is ""still growing"". His release point of 2.35m is third-highest recorded by a spinner, meaning he is likely to gain more of a slow bowler's key weapon: bounce. All-rounder Stokes continued: ""The decisions we make are all based around not only how far we think talent can take a player, but if we think they're good enough for international cricket straight away. ""'Bash' showed what he could do in India with conditions in his favour, but the pitch this week didn't really offer much for spin and he has taken seven wickets in the match. I don't want to sound like it's an 'I told you so' kind of thing, but it sort of is."" This video can not be played Vaughan praises Bashir after his five-wicket haul Stokes first spotted Bashir in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, bowling in his first-class debut in June of last year to England's all-time leading run-scorer, Sir Alastair Cook. Stokes then shared the video in a WhatsApp group with McCullum and England managing director Rob Key. ""The ceiling for Bashir is so high,"" Cook told Test Match Special. ""You've got to bowl to learn your craft, but what we're seeing is him learning on the job and still delivering the goods. ""He's nowhere near the finished article, and what will be funny is in 10 years' time, if he's still playing, he'll look back and think 'cor, I wasn't very good then', and yet he's still doing the job for England."" Bashir's 24-wicket haul is the third-most in the first five Tests by an England spinner since World War Two, behind Nick Cook and Graeme Swann. Bashir himself had not been to Trent Bridge before he played for England in Nottingham. After England set West Indies 385 to win or four sessions to bat for a draw, Bashir spearheaded the tear through the tourists, who were bowled out in 36.1 overs after tea on Sunday. ""It was the first time I have bowled for England in England and it was so special to finish it in a session,"" Bashir told Test Match Special. ""I'm the youngest in the group, everyone gets around me. I’m still trying to soak everything in, that innings went so quickly.""

619,'I didn’t give up the win. I lost it off the line',"Lando Norris agonised over whether to hand victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix back to team-mate Oscar Piastri but said it was the “fair"" and “honest” thing to do. The Briton spent 20 laps debating the move with his team, as the drivers raced to McLaren’s first one-two for nearly three years, but said that he was “always quite confident” he was going to do it. “I didn't deserve to win the race,” Norris said. “Simple as that. The fact I was in that position was incorrect. “If Oscar's led the whole race, it's not fair, and I don't think that's how it should work, that he should just let me pass for me to win because I'm fighting for a championship.” “I didn’t give up the race win. I lost it off the line.” Both drivers admitted after the race that McLaren had made their lives harder than would be ideal. Norris was ahead of Piastri - for whom this was a maiden win - only because the team had chosen to make the Briton’s second and final pit stop early to protect against Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes, who had recently made his own and fitted fresh tyres. McLaren were cautious in the timing - excessively so, some said - because Norris still had five seconds to play with. But team principal Andrea Stella said that he preferred to reduce the impact of a potential delay at a pit stop and handle the situation within the team than risk losing track position. The decision to pit Norris first from just over a second behind inevitably - because of the extra pace provided by fresh tyres - put Norris ahead of Piastri when the Australian made his own final stop a couple of laps later. And the situation did indeed appear to take some handling. Time and again, Norris’ engineer Will Joseph went on the radio to urge Norris to follow instructions; time and again Norris pushed back, or sometimes did not respond at all. At one point, Joseph had to say: “Radio check” to ensure Norris was getting the messages. “Loud and clear,” came the reply. Why did he not reassure the team, Norris was asked. “I don’t need to,” he said. “I know what I’m going to do and not going to do. “Of course I’m going to question and challenge it. And that’s what I did. I was going to wait until the last corner, last lap. But they said if there was a safety car all of a sudden, then I couldn’t let Oscar go through and it would have made me look like a bit of an idiot and I was like, fair point, so I let him go two laps to go. “You can make of it what you will, of what you hear and what you think you know, but I know I was always going to give it back unless they changed their mind and they didn’t, so all good.” Piastri wins in Hungary after Norris team orders row Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Red Bull need to do better - Verstappen The result - combined with a difficult race for championship leader Max Verstappen, who collided with Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes and finished fifth - allowed Norris to close his deficit in the drivers’ championship to the Dutchman to 76 points. McLaren are now just 51 points behind Red Bull in the constructors' with 11 races to go. And Norris admitted it was the championship that had made him doubt his decision most. “It’s always going to go through your mind,” he said. “You have to be selfish in this sport at times. That’s priority number one to think of yourself. “I’m also a team player. My mind was going pretty crazy at the time. I know what we’ve done in the past. Oscar’s helped me plenty of times. But this isn’t that. I was put into a position and we were undoing it. “I know a lot of people are going to say the gap between me and Max is pretty big but if Red Bull and Max make the mistakes they did today and we continue to improve and have weekends like this, we can turn it around. “It is still optimistic and a big goal to say I can close 70 points in half a season, and seven points I give away... it crosses your mind. So it was not easy. “But I also understood the situation I was in and I was quite confident that by the last lap I would have done it.” Piastri took his first career grand prix win Before the race, it looked like Norris’ to lose. He had started on pole, on the racing line, and normally the drivers on the inside make slower starts at the Hungaroring because of the lack of grip off line. But Norris’ start was not good, and Piastri got alongside him as they went three-wide into the first corner with Verstappen. Norris briefly dropped behind Verstappen - who was ordered to give the place back because he had gained it by going off the track. Once back in second place, on a track where overtaking is difficult  - partly because of the circuit’s twisty nature and partly because of the hot weather that means cars behind others overheat their tyres even more than normal - Norris was never going to pass a car from the same team with such similar pace. ""I boxed first and naturally you will always undercut. The team gave me this position and I gave it back, nothing more than that,” he said. ""Something we always talk about before every race is our trust in one another, our honesty we have as a group. I think that's something that's allowed us to catch others so quickly, to perform and outperform others so quickly to develop the car quicker.” Despite Norris’ arguments with the pit wall, team principal Stella, who has masterminded McLaren’s revival over the past 18 months, said he had no doubts his driver would do what was asked. “I know Lando enough,” Stella said. “Sometimes you have to communicate to all the sides that exist inside a race driver. “But I know him well enough to know that inside Lando we have a race driver and a team player. These two elements came along perfectly today to generate what was the right thing to do for the team, for Oscar and Lando. “I know for the media and watching on TV this becomes a story. But for us internally this becomes part of the way we go racing, and that’s why we invest so much in culture, values and mindset. We want to be able to manage the situation if we want to be in the championship with Lando, Oscar and McLaren.” Stella is an intelligent and eloquent man, but also a tough one. A driver who did not accede to such a policy, he said, could find somewhere else to race. “Interests of the team come first,” Stella said. “If you mess up on this matter, you cannot be part of the McLaren F1 team. That’s the principle.” But he said he had no concerns Norris would eventually do what was right.  Asked why it had taken Norris so long, Stella replied: “Because he’s a race driver. Mention me a race driver who would have not done (the same thing). Actually you can mention to me many who would have not done it until lap 70, and I would be extremely concerned in that case if Lando had not demonstrated I am a race driver because that’s the ethos you need to fight hard with Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton and more and Oscar himself. “It is entertaining to talk about the controversial aspects, but it would be unfair not to talk about the resolution which happened according to our way of going racing.” It was hard to argue with the idea Piastri deserved to win - a result that has looked only a matter of time since he made his debut with McLaren last year. The Australian led the race confidently after winning the start. The only blot on his copybook an off at Turn 11 that allowed Norris to get back in range before that crucial final stop. It was not his first F1 win - he won the sprint in Qatar last year - but it was his first grand prix victory. It will surely not be the last. “An incredible moment that I've been dreaming of for a very long time,” Piastri said. “My first dream in my career was reaching F1. The second one is winning a race. Yeah, I'm very, very happy and proud and not just of myself, but everybody that's helped me get to this position. “Going back to my family, firstly, of course. You know, it took a lot of big decisions at a young age to chase the F1 dream. “It's very difficult to become an F1 driver by staying in Australia, so it meant some big decisions early in life. And, yeah, just very, very proud that, you know, those decisions have paid off and we've managed to make it worth it.”",2024-07-21 23:10:22,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cye03ylnnr0o,Andrew Benson,2024-07-21 22:10:22,
621,England dismantle Windies to win Test and series,"This video can not be played Day four highlights Second Rothesay Test (day four of five), Trent Bridge England 416 (Pope 121; A Joseph 3-98) & 425 (Root 122, Brook 109; Seales 4-97) West Indies 457 (Hodge 120; Woakes 4-84) & 143 (Bashir 5-41) England won by 241 runs Scorecard England surged to a series win by blowing away West Indies in a single session on the fourth day of the second Test at Trent Bridge. Set 385 to win or four sessions to save the game, West Indies disintegrated from 61-0 to 82-5 in a manic blur of five wickets in six overs. Chris Woakes twice found the edge to remove openers Mikyle Louis and Kraigg Brathwaite, and off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowled a magical spell to claim 3-8 in 15 deliveries. From there, the only question was whether the game would last until Monday. Mark Wood bounced out Kevin Sinclair, Gus Atkinson struck twice in three balls and Bashir took the final two wickets to end with 5-41. West Indies were 143 all out and beaten by 241 runs. All this came after Joe Root and Harry Brook each made centuries to lay the platform for England’s victory push. Root’s 122 was his 32nd Test hundred, one short of Sir Alastair Cook’s England record, while Brook added 109 for his first Test ton in this country. West Indies’ target might have been larger had England not lost 7-96, but the regular fall of home wickets also gave Ben Stokes’ side enough time to wrap up the game with a day to spare. It gives England their first series win since the tour of Pakistan in 2022. They will look for a 3-0 clean sweep when the final Test begins at Edgbaston on Friday, and have named an unchanged squad. Bashir 'showed the world what he can do' - Stokes Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Bashir bags five as England win emphatically This video can not be played Watch Bashir's five-wicket haul The rapid way this match unravelled in the final session of the fourth day was at odds with everything that came before, when these teams had wrestled for control. Even with the runs Root and Brook scored in the morning session, there was still a ray of light for West Indies, who clung on by taking 3-19 just before lunch. In the end, the target always felt likely to be well beyond them, despite the great spirit they have shown in responding to a heavy first Test defeat at Lord’s and the fact the pitch showed no huge sign of deteriorating until West Indies began their chase. Suddenly, England were getting the ball to shoot and spit, particularly from the new Stuart Broad End. Woakes exploited some uncertain footwork, while Bashir hinted at why England have chosen him ahead of Somerset team-mate Jack Leach. By this point, free entry for the fifth day had been offered to spectators, much like the last men’s Test at this ground, when England thrillingly beat New Zealand in 2022 on the day their Bazball style was born. The fifth day was not required, but the outcome is the same: an England win and an unassailable 2-0 series lead. This video can not be played Wood's 'nasty bouncer' gets Sinclair for one Given the conditions, England might have been expecting a similar slog to the first innings, when they needed almost 112 overs to dismiss West Indies for 457. Instead, this was a collective display of brilliance by the home attack, who dismantled the Windies in 36.1 overs of mayhem after tea. Brathwaite in particular had looked in solid touch for 47 in his opening stand of 61 with Louis, but once Louis was drawn into an edge by Woakes, the implosion was swift and dramatic. Kirk McKenzie somehow edged a Bashir half-tracker to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, while Brathwaite’s edge off was almost a replay of Louis’ dismissal to really expose the tourists. Kavem Hodge was lbw playing back to Bashir, who then found gorgeous turn to draw the edge of left-hander Alick Athanaze. West Indies had lost 5-21. The four-day finish was a possibility, made a reality when fleeting resistance from Sinclair was ended by a brutal bouncer in another terrifying spell from Wood. Atkinson pinned Joshua da Silva lbw and scuttled one through Alzarri Joseph before Bashir produced his best, one that turned to end Jason Holder’s defiance on 37. When last man Shamar Joseph was bowled having a swipe, 20-year-old Bashir became the youngest England bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a home Test and the first spinner to take five in an innings at Trent Bridge since 2006. This video can not be played Best shots of Brook's 100 Root and Brook, a master-and-apprentice pairing at four and five, had guided England from danger on the third evening and resumed on 248-3, leading by 207. Neither of the Yorkshiremen were troubled as they blunted any possibility of the early wickets that would have got West Indies back in the game. Brook, appearing to have so much time, either waited for the ball and guided it through third man, or played beautiful straight drives. This was the 25-year-old’s fifth Test hundred and first in 17 months. Root accumulated in trademark fashion with pushes, deflections and clips. The seven fours in his hundred is the second-fewest in all of his Test tons. A fifth hundred in Nottingham is his joint-most at any venue and equals the record for centuries on this ground, shared by Michael Atherton and Denis Compton. He celebrated by reverse-scooping Shamar Joseph for four. Just as England were set to accelerate, Brook flapped an edge off Jayden Seales to end a stand of 189. Captain Stokes pulled the same bowler to long leg and Smith edged off-spinner Sinclair. The home side never fully regained the momentum, but in reaching 425 to go with their first-innings 416 this was the first time England have passed 400 twice in the same Test.

England captain Ben Stokes talking to TMS: ""I didn't see it happening that quickly after the opening partnership. You could see at the end of our innings the wicket started misbehaving, I thought the way we fought back after that first wicket was impressive.

633,"'Significant number' of devices back online after outage, CrowdStrike says","Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike says ""a significant number"" of devices that were impacted by a global IT outage on Friday are now back online. In a social media post, the company - whose faulty security update caused Microsoft Windows computers to crash around the world - added it ""continues to focus on restoring all systems"". Microsoft has estimated that the incident, which is being described as one of the worst IT outages in history, impacted 8.5m computers around the world. Businesses, banks, hospitals and airlines were among the worst-hit, with some still struggling to fully restore their systems. ""We understand the profound impact this has had on everyone. We know our customers, partners and their IT teams are working tirelessly and we’re profoundly grateful,"" CrowdStrike said. ""We apologise for the disruption this has created."" The firm also said it is deploying a new fix that it hoped would speed up the recovery of computer systems. However, CrowdStrike did not say how many devices were still being impacted. More than 1,400 flights, into or out of the US, were cancelled on Sunday, according to aviation tracking and data platform FlightAware. Delta and United Airlines were the worst affected US airlines. Health services in Britain, Israel and Germany were also impacted on Friday, with some services cancelled. The massive outage has put a spotlight on the vulnerability of global computer networks, showing how a single glitch can cause global chaos. ""All too often these days, a single glitch results in a system-wide outage, affecting industries from healthcare and airlines to banks and auto dealers"" said the Chair of the US Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, in a social media post. ""These incidents reveal how concentration can create fragile systems."" Until this incident the company had been one most trusted brands in the cybersecurity industry. According to CrowdStrike's website, it has 29,000 customers around the world, including some of the biggest companies in the US. One major economy largely unscathed by the outage was China, as CrowdStrike is not widely used in the country.

631,UAE jails 57 Bangladeshis over protests against own government,"A court in the United Arab Emirates has handed 57 Bangladeshis long prison terms for holding protests in the Gulf state against their own country’s government. Three of the unnamed defendants were sentenced to life for “inciting riots in several streets across the UAE on Friday”, while 53 others were jailed for 10 years and one for 11 years, state-run Wam news agency reported. It cited their court-appointed defence lawyer as arguing during Sunday’s trial that the gatherings had no criminal intent and that the evidence was insufficient. Amnesty International condemned what it called the UAE’s “extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest” on its soil. Protests are effectively illegal in the UAE, where foreigners make up almost 90% of the population. Bangladeshis are the third largest expatriate group. In Bangladesh, more than 150 people have been killed and 500 arrested during days of violence sparked by student-led demonstrations against quotas on government jobs. On Monday some of the protest leaders gave the government a 48-hour ultimatum to lift a nationwide curfew and restore internet services. They are also demanding the resignation of officials they blame for violence against demonstrators. The unrest is among the most serious challenges Sheikh Hasina has faced in 15 consecutive years as the country’s prime minister. According to Wam, the trial of the 57 Bangladeshis heard that they had “organised large-scale marches in several streets of the UAE in protest against decisions made by the Bangladeshi government”. “This led to riots, disruption of public security, obstruction of law enforcement, and endangerment of public and private property,” it said. “The police had warned the protesters, ordering them to disperse, to which they were unresponsive”. The court rejected the defendants’ defence and ordered that they be deported after serving their sentences, Wam said. There was no immediate comment from Bangladesh’s government. But its consulate in Dubai urged citizens to respect local laws in a social media post on Sunday. Amnesty International’s UAE researcher, Devin Kenney, said it was the second mass trial in the UAE this month, in which dozens of people had been sentenced to “huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence”. “[The] extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country,"" he told AFP news agency. On 10 July, a court in the UAE handed life sentences to 43 human rights defenders and political dissidents who were convicted of “creating a terrorist organisation”.  Human rights groups said the organisation had been an “independent advocacy group” and severely criticised the mass trial as a “mockery of justice”.",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgk8gnpg0zo,Unknown,Unknown,
630,India alert after boy dies from Nipah virus in Kerala,"Health authorities in India's Kerala state have issued an alert after a 14-year-old boy died of the Nipah virus.  According to the state's health minister, an additional 60 people have been identified as being in the high-risk category of having the disease.  Kerala Health Minister Veena George said the boy was from the town of Pandikkad and that those who came into contact with him have been isolated and tested.  People in the area have been asked to take precautions such as wearing masks in public areas and refraining from visiting people in hospital.  What is Nipah virus?  The Nipah virus infection is a ""zoonotic illness"" transmitted from animals like pigs and fruit bats to humans, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO has described the virus as a priority pathogen because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.  What are the symptoms of Nipah virus? Initial symptoms may include: In some people, this can be followed by: How deadly is it? People who contract the virus sometimes show no noticeable symptoms, while others show signs of acute respiratory problems. In severe cases, a Nipah infection can result in foetal encephalitis - a serious condition that affects the brain. The mortality rate among those who contract the virus is high as there is no medicine or vaccine available to treat the infection. Treatment is limited to managing symptoms and supportive care. How does the Nipah virus spread? It can be transmitted through contaminated food and through contact with an infected person. Experts say that due to habitat loss, animals are living in closer proximity to humans and this helps the virus jump from animals to humans.  The Kerala state government recently announced that it was creating an action plan to prevent a Nipah outbreak.  Last year, authorities in the state closed schools and offices after confirming five cases.  Where in India has Nipah virus been found? According to the WHO, the first two outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 were both reported in the eastern state of West Bengal. In 2018, 17 people were killed in an outbreak in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts in the southern state of Kerala. The virus has been linked to dozens of deaths in Kerala state since it was first reported there in 2018.  The 14-year-old died on Sunday, just a day after he was confirmed to have the virus, according to Indian media reports.  Parts of Kerala are said to be the most at-risk globally for the virus. An investigation   published by Reuters last year found that Kerala, which is a tropical state and is witnessing rapid urbanisation and rapid tree loss, created ""ideal conditions for a virus like Nipah to emerge"".  What are fruit bats? Fruit bats, also called ""megabats"", are a grouping that contain some of the largest bats in the world. These mammals, usually found in tropical and sub-tropical regions, are natural hosts for the Nipah virus.",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj50d7e9vp6o,Unknown,Unknown,
629,At least six killed in Croatia nursing home shooting,"At least six people have been killed after a gunman opened fire in a care home in Croatia, sparking calls for stricter gun control in the Balkan country.  Five people, including an employee, were killed in the home in the eastern town of Daruvar, while another person later died in hospital. Police said several people were also injured, and four remain in a critical condition. The suspect fled the scene after the attack and was later arrested at a cafe, where he was found carrying unregistered firearms, according to Croatian media. Croatia's President Zoran Milanovic said he was shocked by the ""savage, unprecedented"" mass shooting and called for rules on gun ownership to be ""even more rigorous"".  ""It is a frightening warning and a last call to all competent institutions to do more to prevent violence in society,” President Milanovic wrote in a social media post. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic called it a ""monstrous attack"" and expressed his condolences to those affected. Croatian authorities have given no motive for the massacre.  Marin Piletic, Croatia's minister for Labour, Pensions, Families and Social Policy, said the mother of the suspect had been a resident of the care home for 10 years.  Unconfirmed reports by local media say the man was a war veteran.  He also had a previous record for disturbing public order and domestic abuse, according to Croatian national police chief Nikola Milina.  ""I was stacking the medicines and then I heard gunshots,"" a shocked employee of the nursing home told state broadcaster HRT.  ""We hid under a bed, the boss escaped through the window and then (we fled) through the window to the bookstore."" The killings have left the 7,000 residents of the quiet spa town of Daruvar in shock.  ""It's hard for me to understand that this can happen in our town, country,"" mayor Damir Lnenicek told Croatian broadcaster N1. Around 20 people lived in the nursing home at the time of the shooting, according to Mr Lnenicek.  Mass shootings in Croatia are rare.  Monday's massacre was among the worst in the country's history since it declared independence in 1991.  According to the 2017 Small Arms Survey, Croatia has 13.2 guns per 100 people, placing it 25th in Europe in terms of gun ownership.  Last year, two mass shootings in neighbouring Serbia left more than 18 people dead and led many Serbs to hand in thousands of registered and unregistered weapons as part of a government amnesty.",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn08d7vyj6wo,Unknown,Unknown,
632,Russian-US journalist jailed for 'false information',"Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva has been jailed for six-and-a-half years by a court in the central city of Kazan on a charge of spreading false information about the Russian army. An editor for US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said the mother of two was arrested in Russia last October for failing to register as a foreign agent. She was sentenced on Friday, court officials said, the same day that fellow US journalist Evan Gershkovich was jailed for 16 years for espionage. Ms Kurmasheva denies any wrongdoing, and Stephen Capus, RFE/RL president and CEO, told the AP news agency that her conviction was ""a mockery of justice"". ""It’s beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,"" Mr Capus added. In a statement to the BBC, her husband Pavel Butorin said: ""The girls and I know Alsu has done nothing wrong. And the world knows it too. We need her home."" Speaking to journalists when her custody was extended in May, Ms Kurmasheva said she had not spoken to her two daughters since her arrest, adding that her health was deteriorating. Ms Kurmasheva, who holds both US and Russian citizenship, works for RFE/RL's Tatar-Bashkir service. The two languages are closely related and spoken by indigenous peoples in two central Russian regions.  Ms Kurmasheva's work frequently focused on issues facing the ethnic minorities of central Russia. According to RFE/RL, Ms Kurmasheva, who lives in the Czech Republic, travelled to Kazan in late May last year for a family emergency. She was detained while waiting for her return flight and her Russian and American passports were confiscated. In Russia it is illegal to fail to declare a US passport. She was fined, then arrested months later on the ""foreign agent"" charge. In December, while in custody, she was hit with the more serious charge of spreading false information. It is believed her conviction may be linked to a book she edited in 2022 entitled Saying No to War, containing interviews with and stories from Russians opposed to the invasion. Independent Russian media organisations and press freedom watchdogs say repressive laws are routinely used by Russian authorities to harass journalists and stifle independent reporting. The situation has worsened since the invasion of Ukraine, with the ""false information"" charge commonly used to stamp out criticism of the war. The charge was rushed through Russia's rubber-stamp parliament shortly after 24 February 2024 - the day Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time it was ""urgently needed because of the absolutely unprecedented information war waged against our country"". Russia has been accused of hoarding US citizens to use as bartering chips to secure the release of Kremlin allies imprisoned abroad.  Mr Gershkovich's sentencing on Friday raised speculation of a possible swap with Russian prisoners held in foreign jails. The speed of his conviction led some observers to believe that an exchange was imminent.  According to Russian judicial practice, an exchange generally requires a verdict to be in place already. But while a possible swap for Mr Gershkovich was mentioned by Russian President Vladimir Putin during an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson in February, Ms Kurmasheva's fate is less clear.

627,Lawmakers call on Secret Service boss to resign,"Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers called on Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to step down in the wake of the assassination attempt of Donald Trump.  The demand came during and after a tense House Oversight Committee hearing on Monday that questioned Ms Cheatle about her agency's security preparations ahead of a 13 July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that led to the attempt on Trump's life.  The shooting left one person dead and three other wounded - including the former president.  Monday's hearing was bruising for Ms Cheatle, as lawmakers ridiculed her answers and the lack of information the agency had made public, but it was also a rare show of bipartisanship on an increasingly polarised Capitol Hill. For nearly six hours, members sought to answer lingering questions about the shooting, including how suspect Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to get onto a nearby rooftop and why Trump was allowed to take the stage once a suspicious person was reported.  After the hearing, the leading Republican and Democrat from the committee - Reps James Comer and Jamie Raskin - sent a letter to Ms Cheatle that concretely laid out their belief that she should vacate her office. ""In the middle of a presidential election, the Committee and the American people demand serious institutional accountability and transparency that you are not providing,"" the letter says. ""We call on you to resign as Director as a first step to allowing new leadership to swiftly address this crisis and rebuild the trust of a truly concerned Congress and the American people."" While Ms Cheatle took responsibility during the hearing for the security lapses and acknowledged that the Butler incident marks ""the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades"", she left many lawmakers frustrated.  Ms Cheatle pushed back on calls to resign and said she remains ""the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time"".  The Secret Service director also answered few questions directly - citing the ongoing investigation. ""The American people have questions, [and] they deserve answers,"" Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer told Ms Cheatle during his closing. ""You were required to provide answers and, ma'am, you did not."" At times, the tense hearing on Monday seemed to devolve into fury. Lawmakers used expletives, shouted at the witness and questioned the director's honesty and competence.  ""I'm disgusted by your performance,"" Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna said. Ms Cheatle's answers seemed to continuously spark the ire of lawmakers on the committee, many of whom said she should be dismissed if she continued to refuse to resign.  ""It looks like you won't answer some pretty basic questions,"" Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, said. ""And it looks like you cut corners when it comes to protecting one of the most well-known individuals on the planet."" Throughout the hearing, some Representatives groaned loudly, rolled their eyes, or muttered audibly in response to Cheatle's comments.  In one of the tensest moments of the hearing, South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace uttered a string of expletives in response to another one of Ms Cheatle's answers, specifically about how her opening remarks were leaked to US media outlets over the weekend.  ""You are being dishonest or lying,"" Mace said. ""You're just dodging!""  Another Republican, Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene, shouted at Ms Cheatle, referring to her as a ""total failure"".  ""The entire country is demanding you resign,"" Ms Greene said.  Ms Cheatle also acknowledged that, to date, no Secret Service officers or employees have been disciplined for what took place in Butler.  According to Ms Cheatle, a preliminary report on the shooting will be released in the next 60 days - a timeline that committee members scoffed at.  New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, said that the delay of such a report during a tense election season was ""not acceptable"".  ""This is not theatre, this is not about jockeying, this is about the safety of some of the most highly targeted and valued targets internationally and domestically,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez said. There needs to be answers. We need to make policy decisions."" ""Without that, we're flying blind,"" she added.  Despite the relative show of unity regarding Ms Cheatle's future, there were some points of disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on the committee.  Several Republicans, for example, characterised Ms Cheatle as a ""DEI"" - diversity, equity and inclusion - hire and questioned, without evidence, whether female agents assigned to Trump's security detail were able to do the job properly.  Others, such as Colorado's Lauren Boebert and Ms Luna of Florida, hinted at conspiracy theories that have appeared online.  Florida Republican Michael Waltz blamed Ms Cheatle for the rumours, arguing that misinformation ""flies"" in the absence of information.  ""I would have fired you just by how you handled this,"" Mr Waltz said, ""because you should have been the first to the mics."" The hearing ended with Mr Comer acknowledging that the hearing did little to answer the questions that Congress had.  ""I don't think we answered too many questions that the American people have,"" he said. Several eyewitnesses to the shooting in Butler told the BBC that Ms Cheatle's answers left them feeling frustrated and angry.  ""She's trying to pass the buck,"" said Jean Vincent, a Butler resident. ""I'm actually amazed at how insufficient her answers were. She needs to be held accountable for her total lack of competency... she put our lives at risk and needs to take responsibility.""  Another witness, former US Marine Teresa Wilson, said that while she understands that there are active investigations still taking place, Ms Cheatle was far too ""evasive"".  ""The only acceptable thing she could have done is take responsibility and step down,"" Ms Wilson said. ""All the rest is noise.""",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx02edwg31do,Unknown,Unknown,
626,Israel orders evacuation of part of Gaza humanitarian zone,"The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 70 people have been killed by Israeli strikes around the southern city of Khan Younis. It comes after Israel ordered the evacuation of part of a designated humanitarian zone ahead of an operation against Palestinian fighters who have apparently regrouped there. The Israeli military said on Monday morning that there had been “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” from eastern neighbourhoods of Khan Younis and told residents to head to the “adjusted” al-Mawasi humanitarian area. It was followed by heavy bombardment, which the military later said had “eliminated terrorists” and infrastructure. Hundreds of people were seen fleeing on foot and by car. Gaza's health ministry said 70 dead people and more than 200 injured, many of them in a serious condition, had been brought to the already overwhelmed Nasser hospital in the west of the city and appealed for blood donations. The Palestinian Red Crescent meanwhile reported that nearby al-Amal hospital, which it runs, had received another five dead and 33 injured. The medical organisation also said its clinics in the towns of Maan and Bani Suhaila, which are both located about 2km (1.25 miles) east of Khan Younis, had gone out of service because of the Israeli evacuation order. Israeli officials said the order did not apply to hospitals. Medics and residents told Reuters news agency that many people had been killed by tank fire in Bani Suhaila, while Hamas’s military wing said it had targeted Israeli tanks there. ""It is like doomsday,"" said one resident, who one identified himself as Abu Khaled. ""People are fleeing under fire, many are dead and wounded on the roads."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Monday evening that an operation above and below ground in Khan Younis had begun ""due to intelligence indicating that terrorists were operating and firing rockets in these areas, as well as efforts by Hamas to reassemble its forces there"".  Aircraft and artillery had “struck more than 30 terror infrastructure sites in Khan Younis, including in the area from which a projectile was launched toward Nirim in southern Israel"" on Monday, as well as a weapons storage facility, observation posts and tunnel shafts, it added. Much of Khan Younis was destroyed in an Israeli offensive which ended in April, but large numbers of people returned after troops began an operation in nearby Rafah in early May. At the start of this month, they were displaced once again after the IDF issued a fresh evacuation order for other eastern neighbourhoods of Khan Younis as well as nearby towns and villages, including Bani Suhaila. They were instructed to go to the humanitarian zone - which stretches along the coast from al-Mawasi to the central town of Deir al-Balah - despite warnings from the UN that it was already overcrowded with tents and lacking basic services and critical infrastructure. Mahmoud Abu Saqr, 46, told the BBC that he and his family had fled Bani Suhaila on Monday and were now “sitting on the street” in the humanitarian zone. “No-one can buy a tent. There is no way anywhere here to put up a new tent, even if we had money,” he said. “The Israeli artillery stationed on the border has been shelling our town since the morning. We were displaced to Rafah in November and returned to the town after the army asked us to do so. Today, we received a text message on our phone.” He added: “There is no such thing as a safe area. It is all a lie.” The IDF said it had decided to temporarily evacuate the eastern part of the humanitarian zone ""in order to mitigate harm to the civilian population and keep civilians away from areas of combat"". It also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, which the group denies. In response, Hamas called on the international community “to take urgent action to stop the series of systematic Zionist killing against our people”. Israel has also carried out several deadly strikes in the humanitarian zone in the past two weeks, which it has said targeted Hamas and allied fighters operating there. On 13 July, the Gaza health ministry said more than 90 people had been killed in an Israeli strike inside al-Mawasi that targeted the head of Hamas’s military wing. The IDF's spokesman said on Friday that there were ""increasing signs"" that Mohammed Deif was among the dead, but that Hamas was hiding what had happened to him. He also confirmed again that the commander of Hamas's Khan Younis brigade was killed in the strike. Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. In a separate development on Monday, the IDF confirmed the deaths in captivity of two more Israeli hostages, based on intelligence information. A statement said an investigation was being carried out into the circumstances of the deaths of Yagev Buchshtab, 35, and Alex Dancyg, 76, who also had Polish citizenship. Israeli media reports cited military sources as saying there was a “high probability” that at least one of the men was killed by Israeli fire. “Yagev and Alex were taken alive and should have returned alive to their families and to their country,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. “Their death in captivity is a tragic reflection of the consequences of foot-dragging in negotiations.” The forum demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately approve a proposed ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. Mr Netanyahu’s office said on Sunday that he had held an in-depth discussion with Israel’s negotiating team and directed them to take part in the next round of indirect talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt later this week. Israel says 116 hostages are still being held in Gaza, 44 of whom are presumed dead. There are another four hostages who were kidnapped before 7 October. Two of them are believed to be dead. The IDF also said on Monday that it was looking into a report that Israeli forces had fired at a marked UN convoy that was heading to Gaza City. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said an armoured car had been hit by at least five bullets while waiting near an Israeli checkpoint south of the Wadi Gaza river valley on Sunday. The vehicle was severely damaged and UN staff had to take cover, but there were no casualties. Mr Lazzarini said the convoy’s movement had been co-ordinated with Israeli authorities and demanded that “those responsible must be held accountable”.",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerz8we1vgo,Unknown,Unknown,

624,Veteran anti-whaling activist arrested in Greenland,"Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson has been arrested in Greenland under an international warrant issued by Japan, authorities and his foundation said. Mr Watson, star of the reality TV show Whale Wars, was arrested when his ship docked in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, a police statement said. The arrest is believed to be related to an Interpol Red Notice issued for Mr Watson’s previous anti-whaling interventions in the Antarctic region, the Captain Paul Watson Foundation said. The 73-year-old will be brought before a district court with a request to detain him pending a decision on his potential extradition to Japan, police said.  Footage posted by his foundation on X showed officers handcuffing Mr Watson on the John Paul DeJoria ship, putting him inside a police van and driving him away. His foundation said it was ""completely shocked, as the Red Notice had disappeared a few months ago"".  ""We were surprised because it could mean that it had been erased or made confidential. We understand now that Japan made it confidential to lure Paul into a false sense of security,"" Locky MacLean, ship operation’s director for the foundation, said in a statement. ""We implore the Danish government to release Captain Watson and not entertain this politically-motivated request."" Greenland is an autonomous Danish dependent territory with self-government and its own parliament. A Red Notice was issued against Mr Watson in 2012, with Interpol stating he was wanted by Japan on charges of causing damage and injury in two incidents in the Antarctic Ocean in 2010 against a Japanese whaling ship. Japan's government has made no comment but a spokeswoman for the Japanese coastguard told the AFP news agency it was aware of the arrest. Mr Watson's foundation said he was on his way to ""intercepting Japan's newly-built factory ship, the Kangei Maru, in the North Pacific"". The ship, which set off from Japan in May, butchers whales caught and killed by smaller vessels. Activists targeted the Kangei Maru's predecessor before 2019, when Japan hunted whales in the Antarctic and North Pacific for what it said were ""scientific"" purposes. Japan left the International Whaling Commission in 2019 and now only conducts commercial whaling in its own waters, and on what it calls a sustainable scale. However, Mr Watson's foundation believes Japan is planning to resume high-seas whaling in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific as early as next year.  In a statement, the group said the ""reactivation"" of the Red Notice against Mr Watson ""is politically motivated and coincides with the launch of a newly-built factory whale processing vessel"". Mr Watson has gained supporters from across the world due to his decades of activism, but has also received criticism and faced legal issues due to his aggressive tactics. Some of that criticism has come from Greenpeace, which Mr Watson claims he was a co-founder of despite the group denying this.",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e5xjx992jo,Unknown,Unknown,
628,New Prince George photo released on 11th birthday,"Kensington Palace has released a new photograph of Prince George to mark his 11th birthday. The photo was taken by his mother, Catherine, Princess of Wales, this year. ""Wishing Prince George a very happy 11th birthday today,"" the Palace's social media account posted alongside the image. The prince was last seen in public accompanying his father, the Prince of Wales, in Berlin for the Euro 2024 final between England and Spain. Catherine regularly takes photographs of her family, sharing them on social media to mark birthdays and special occasions. This year’s photo of the prince, displayed in black and white, contrasts with the more casual image shared on his 10th birthday where he was seen sitting on steps, sleeves rolled back. In the latest photo, he can be seen wearing a friendship bracelet - not dissimilar to the one worn by his sister, Princess Charlotte, during the Wimbledon men’s final earlier this month. In June, Prince George - who is second in line to the throne - celebrated his grandfather King Charles III’s birthday, appearing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with other members of the Royal Family. The event was Catherine’s first public appearance since she announced her cancer diagnosis earlier this year.",2024-07-22 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4yxd3dw7qo,Unknown,Unknown,
635,Who could be Kamala Harris's running mate?,"US President Joe Biden on Sunday announced he would end his re-election campaign endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris to replace him as the party's nominee for the 2024 race. Ms Harris is yet to be officially nominated, and she will need a running mate when Democratic party delegates vote next month at a convention in Chicago to officially confirm who is on the ticket. Historically, vice-presidents are picked to complement a candidate and strategists believe for that reason she may pick a white man from a swing state. The following names are reported to be in the mix. Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The speedy repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  Mr Shapiro said Mr Biden was one of the ""most consequential presidents in modern history"" and would ""do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States"". Mr Beshear has carved out a successful career as the Democratic leader of a deep-red state. He won his first term in 2019 and was re-elected in 2023, campaigning on key issues for the party like supporting public education and protecting reproductive rights. His popularity in Kentucky is crucial, given that the state voted for Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020. At 46, Mr Beshear is also one of the youngest governors in the country. He has been floated around as a potential pick to lead the party in the 2028 presidential election. But now with Mr Biden out of the picture, Mr Beshear's run for the White House could come much sooner. Former astronaut and combat veteran Mr Kelly is a possible contender given his success in Arizona, a key swing state, including a decisive victory in the 2022 mid-term election. Trump has been leading Biden in the state’s polling, so recruiting Mr Kelly could boost the Democrats’ popularity at a crucial moment in the race. He is the husband of former House Representative Gabby Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona. With gun violence being a major campaign issue for Democrats, Mr Kelly’s personal story could resonate with voters. Gretchen Whitmer, the two-term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular Midwest Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told The New York Times that she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies, including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  Ms Whitmer quickly stated after Mr Biden's withdrawal that her job ""will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump"". She endorsed Ms Harris on Monday, writing on X that the vice-president has her ""full support"".  ""In Vice President Harris, Michigan voters have a candidate they can count on to lower their costs, protect their freedoms, and build an economy that works for working people,"" she said.  Ms Whitmer also announced she would be serving as co-chair of the Harris campaign.  California's governor is one of the Biden administration's fiercest surrogates.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits had suggested he could be in the race to replace Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  He stood by the president before his announcement. He travelled to Washington to attend meetings in July with Mr Biden and other top Democratic governors, and headlined a Biden campaign event in Michigan on the 4 July. Mr Newsom again praised Mr Biden as a ""selfless"" president after his withdrawal, and said he backed the ""fearless"" and ""tenacious"" Ms Harris to face Trump. Mr Cooper is another Democrat who has seen great success in a state that has voted for Trump twice, both in 2016 and in 2020.  North Carolina is seen as a big opportunity for Democrats given its rapidly growing population around its major centres, Charlotte and Raleigh. Ms Harris herself has travelled to the state several times this year in a bid to shore up support for her party.  Along with his popularity, Mr Cooper brings with him a deep wealth of knowledge, having served in public office since 1987.  He sat in both the House and the Senate, and was later elected attorney general for the state - a job he had for 16 years thanks to three successful re-election bids. Mr Cooper then moved on to serve as governor, elected at first in 2017 and again in 2020.  He has already voiced his support for Ms Harris' presidential bid, writing on social media: ""I've known (the vice-president) going back to our days as AGs, and she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump"". It is no secret that Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as transportation secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Mr Buttigieg stated on Twitter/X that Mr Biden had ""earned his place among the best and most consequential presidents in American history"". He said he would do ""all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President"". JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats' to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  He said Mr Biden had run ""one of the most accomplished and effective presidencies of our lifetime"".  Mr Pritzker endorsed Ms Harris on Monday, writing on X that Mr Biden's decision to step down came as a ""genuine surprise"". He added that the vice-president is the party's best chance to defeat Trump.  ""Vice President Harris has proven, at every point in her career, that she possesses the skills, strength, and character to lead this country and the vision to better lives of all Americans,"" he said.  The list of potential nominees to the ticket stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of talent.   Maryland Governor Wes Moore found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  And Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested Senate race in a swing state.",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ekdwk9zro,Unknown,Unknown,
636,Harris raises $81m after Biden's exit from presidential race,"Democrats have poured $81m (£62m) in donations into Vice-President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday.  It is the largest 24-hour period of campaign funding in presidential history with more than 888,000 donors making contributions of less than $200 in the day after Mr Biden stepped aside.  “Grassroots supporters are energized and excited to support her as the Democratic nominee,” ActBlue, the progressive donation platform, said on X.  Donors who had pulled back their funding over concerns about Mr Biden’s age say they now intend to resume their support for the party. The party raised over $27.5m in the first five hours of Ms Harris’ presidential campaign. That number nearly doubled by the end of the day. In 24 hours, the sum broke a presidential fundraising record.  The surge in donations in the last 24 hours is the single biggest for online contributions to Democrats since 2020, according to the New York Times, when ActBlue raised $73.5m after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg. The new funds mark a significant turn for the Democratic party, which had seen support erode from major donors after Mr Biden’s poor performance in June’s presidential debate against Donald Trump. Grassroots funding from small donors had also diminished, according to Biden campaign insiders cited in US media. But soon after Mr Biden’s announcement to drop out of the race and his endorsement of Ms Harris’ bid for the White House, Democrats went online to contribute at a startling pace. Win With Black Women, a group of black women leaders, held a Zoom call with more than 44,000 participants on Sunday night to throw their support behind the vice-president. The group says it raised over $1.5m in three hours for her presidential campaign. Joe Cotchett, a San Francisco-based political fundraiser for the Democrats, told NBC News that donors “are now ready to dig into their pockets"". Among them is Gideon Stein, president of the Moriah Fund and a donor for the party, who told the US news outlet that he will resume his funding after having paused it because of concerns over Mr Biden’s electability. Several high-profile political donors have also indicated their support for Ms Harris as the Democratic party nominee.  Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, called the vice-president ""the right person at the right time"".  ""I wholeheartedly support Kamala Harris and her candidacy for President of the United States in our fight for democracy in November,"" he said in a post on X. Another big name political donor, Alexander Soros, the son of philanthropist George Soros, said Ms Harris is ""the best and most qualified candidate we have"".  But others, like entrepreneur and investor Vinod Khosla, called for an open process at the convention and ""not a coronation"". ""The key still is who can best beat Trump above all other priorities,"" he wrote on X.  Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, known to be a Democratic megadonor, previously told the New York Times Biden should step down as the Democratic party nominee.  ""Dem delegates need to pick a swing state winner,"" he wrote on X on Sunday following Mr Biden's announcement.  ",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxx2d25l634o,Unknown,Unknown,
637,The last days of the Biden campaign – as seen on Air Force One,"Five nights ago, I stood on the tarmac at Dover Air Force Base and watched Joe Biden, wearing a dark jacket and baseball cap, gingerly descend the staircase of Air Force One.  From my position in the travelling press pool, I saw each unsteady step downward being scrutinised as closely as his acts of office. From the plane emerged an inescapable scene of frailty. The human weakness of age seemed to have overcome the most powerful man on earth. Mr Biden, 81, had just tested positive for Covid. We had flown back with him from Las Vegas in what became a debilitating end to a trip meant to see him hitting the campaign trail with full force.  The scene at Dover, now being replayed over and over on the news channels covering his election exit, was his last public appearance before he pulled out of the race on Sunday. If feels now like the image of the end of his candidacy. So much changed in a week. Last Monday, when I and other press joined him aboard the presidential plane for that campaign trip to Nevada, the president clearly felt the Democratic nomination was still his to hold onto. Donald Trump had dodged an assassin’s bullet two days earlier, giving Mr Biden a political reprieve from the growing calls from Congressional Democrats for him to step down from the race.  His campaign hoped the trip would reinvigorate black and Hispanic voters who traditionally overwhelmingly back the Democrats but whose support for Mr Biden had slipped since 2020. On Tuesday, I watched him energise a packed convention hall with a speech to the African-American civil rights group the NAACP. I spoke to some delegates who were literally dancing in the aisles before Mr Biden’s speech. “Four more years” echoed through the venue. But the next morning, things began to spin out of control. The end of the road was the Original Lindo Michoácan Restaurant, Las Vegas, Nevada. This was one of those highly orchestrated campaign stops where the president mingles with voters. The press was ushered inside to capture the president’s entrance. As the door swung open, I was struck by how pale he looked, and how much slower he seemed than the day before as he shook hands with diners.  We shouted questions about the growing list of Democrats questioning his fitness to run – he didn’t answer. Then we were hustled back out to the press vans while he did a radio interview inside. We waited. And waited. In the searing Nevada heat we spent more than 90 minutes in the press vans with the entire motorcade stalled. It was by now obvious that something was wrong. Suddenly, an email dropped from a BBC colleague to say the host of his next speech venue had announced, on stage, that Mr Biden had just tested positive for Covid. As I tried to approach a White House staffer to find out what was going on, I was abruptly ordered to get back in my van, and told that we were leaving. The motorcade began rolling and we were speeding our way through the suburbs of Las Vegas, destination unknown. The campaign was changing course. Suddenly, amid the flashing lights and police outriders, the airport came into view. The president was going home to Delaware to recover from Covid, the campaign trip was over.  Soon his campaign would be too, when he made the announcement that he was no longer running for president from his beachside home just days later. In hindsight, his last appearance at the air force base in Dover seemed like a final attempt to defy the inevitable, what campaign-donor George Clooney called “the battle against time”. On the tarmac we had asked him, one last time, about waning Democratic support. This time, he answered back: “I’m doing well”. It wasn’t quite what we had asked, not really.

638,What is Kamala Harris's 'brat' rebrand all about?,"Kamala Harris has overhauled her campaign's online presence by embracing a social media trend inspired by pop star Charli XCX's Brat album cover. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has scattered references to the album across her campaign's account, renaming her profile Kamala HQ.  Her rebrand comes as Charli showed her support by tweeting ""kamala IS brat"" shortly after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping out of the race for the White House and endorsed his vice-president.  By Monday morning, Ms Harris had seized on Charli's backing - with the account sporting a new lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.  Brat is the name of Charli's sixth studio album and her tweet about Vice-President Harris received almost nine million views in just four hours. The album's artwork is a lime green square with the word brat written in the middle in a low resolution Arial font.  Charli told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast that brat is a concept that represents a person who might have ""a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra"". It has been deemed by some pop critics as a rejection of the ""clean girl"" aesthetic popularised on TikTok, which spurned a groomed ideal of femininity, and instead embraces more hedonistic and rebellious attitudes. “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things some times,” Charli explained on social media.  “Who feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat.” The #bratsummer trend has nearly one million posts on TikTok and the lime green theme has been used by thousands of individuals and businesses.  In recent weeks - as pressure to drop out of the race grew on President Biden following several public errors - supporters of Ms Harris have been producing videos that combine clips of her speaking with songs from Charli's album.  One of the most recent viral videos shows Ms Harris telling a story about her mother during a White House event in 2023. She said: ""My mother used to - she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'  ""You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you."" Supporters of the vice-president are now posting memes of coconut trees.  Kamala HQ's X account has also started to repost memes (which often feature a recognisable image or video clip, paired with a witty caption or phrase) and swear words. In other words, Ms Harris is very much appealing to younger voters who now, thanks in part to Charli XCX, see her as the ""cool girl"" option.  On Sunday, just hours after Joe Biden announced that he was stepping down from the 2024 presidential race and would be endorsing Harris, the campaign officially filed to alter its name. Reflecting the change, the Biden-Harris campaign page on X implemented its new branding.  It was previously called Biden-Harris HQ and had leant heavily into internet memes about President Joe Biden.  New documents filed with the Federal Election Commission stated that the campaign would be known as 'Harris for President' and that Ms Harris would be conducting business as a presidential, not vice-presidential, candidate.",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqqlgq7k374o,Unknown,Unknown,
639,Why Nigerians are praying for the success of a new oil refinery,"A prayer was held a few months ago in Kano, a very religious city in northern Nigeria. It was organised to pray for the success of a huge new Nigerian oil refinery that next month is due to start producing petrol for the first time. Praying for such an industrial facility might seem incongruous, but many Nigerians are hopeful that the Dangote Petroleum Refinery will lead to both a big increase in the availability of petrol, and a subsequent drop in prices. The $19bn (£15bn) refinery, based along the coast from Nigeria’s commercial hub Lagos, in the south of the country, is the size of almost 4,000 football pitches. Its construction began back in 2016, and it started production of diesel and an aviation fuel in January of this year. Petrol is now set to follow. The hope is that the facility will end Nigeria’s dependence on imports of these fuels. While Nigeria is Africa’s largest producer of crude oil, and the world’s 15th biggest, none of its existing government-owned refineries are operational. The privately-owned Dangote refinery has been built by Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote. Born in Kano, the 67-year-old has a net worth of $12.6bn (£9.7bn), according to Forbes magazine.  Via his company, Dangote Group, he made his fortune in cement and sugar before taking on what many say is his biggest challenge yet when he launched the refinery. The recent prayer session in Kano was organised by shop owner Lado Danladi, and held at a nearby mosque. He was joined by some of his neighbouring shopkeepers. “I run a small phone charging shop, and every day I buy $5 petrol for my small generator as there’s no stable electricity,” says Mr Danladi. “But since I heard about the Dangote Refinery I have been praying for its success. “I can't estimate the hours I have lost trying to get fuel in the past during shortages, so hopefully the refinery will end the suffering, and help small businesses like mine get cheap and easy fuel.” Mr Danladi’s fellow shop owners, a meat seller, and a drinks vendor all have similar complaints of buying “expensive” fuel to power generators. For decades Nigerians enjoyed subsidised petrol prices. But last year incoming President Bola Tinubu stopped the subsidies, saying that they were no longer affordable. This led to prices surging by as much as four-fold. Then this spring and early summer, shortages of petrol led to queues outside petrol stations, and the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company warned against people panic buying. The situation is not helped by Nigeria's corruption problem. According to the closely-watched global corruption index, from non-governmental organisation Transparency International, Nigeria ranks 145th out of 180 countries. The higher the placing, the more corrupt a country is deemed to be. The Dangote refinery will have the capacity to produce 650,000 barrels of fuel per day once fully operational. Devakumar Edwin, vice president of Dangote Group says the refinery will be producing 500,000 before the end of August, which will exceed the country’s 480,000 barrels per day usage. The aim is to export the surplus. Abubakar Maigandi, the president of Nigeria’s independent petrol marketers, who has been in the oil business for 30 years, says the Dangote refinery will solve their longstanding logistics problem. “I foresee Dangote refinery solving the logistics issue we face at the moment trying to get hold of imported petrol for consumers, since this will be refined here in Nigeria,” he says. “This will also mean cheaper petrol for Nigerians since importation costs have been removed. My hope is also that Dangote refinery deal with us directly without middlemen who will complicate things.” Meanwhile, Mr Dangote said in an interview on 21 July that he might be prepared to sell the refinery in the future to the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company. Speaking to the Premium Times newspaper, he said that some people were opposed to him owning such a crucial facility. Nigerian public affairs analyst Sani Bala says the Dangote refinery needs to “crash the price of petrol” for its impact to be felt across the country. He adds: “Personally, I also think we shouldn’t be solely relying on the Dangote refinery for our energy needs. What if something happens to it? We go back to drawing board. There should be another working refinery. “Also, as an environmental activist it also concerns me the level of emissions, we’ll be seeing from this mammoth oil refining facility not forgetting the impact on those communities nearby.” Speaking about the impact of the facility on local people, a dialogue was held to discuss concerns last year. Youth leader Arepo Azeez says there are numerous issues, such as “vibrations” from the refinery. ""We also worry over possible accidental discharges of crude oil into the waters, incidences of mishandling of equipment, which will result in the spilling of crude oil, and even refined products when the refinery fully comes on stream."" Yet for Mr Lado back in Kano, he is really looking forward to the prospect of much cheaper petrol. Additional reporting by Nkechi Ogbonna.

640,"Russians will be at the Olympics, but not in the medal table","There is a chance the medal table at Paris 2024 will not add up. That is because athletes from Russia and Belarus will be competing at the Olympics as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) and as well as not being allowed their national flags or anthems, they are also not going to be included in the official medal table. Russia and Belarus are banned from sending teams to the Games following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been supported by Belarus. But the countries are being invited to send individual athletes who meet strict criteria set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) relating to whether athletes support the war or have military links.   Russia has historically sent some of the largest contingents to the Olympics - even when competing at recent Games under sanctions imposed after a doping scandal - and is one of the medal-winning heavyweights.   But this time it will be very different. The IOC has invited just 36 Russian and 24 Belarusian athletes - of which only 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians have accepted the invitations. At Tokyo 2020, the Russian Olympic Committee sent 335 athletes and Belarus sent 101.  While Russia has said it was not planning to boycott the Games, its weightlifting federation has cited the ""unsportsmanlike selection principle"" in guiding its decision to turn down invitations for 10 athletes. Nine of those athletes initially accepted an invitation, according to the IOC. Its judo federation pointed to similar concerns, saying it would not accept the ""humiliating conditions"" and declined the invitation for its four athletes, one of whom the IOC listed as having initially accepted. So, how did we get to this point and what will the Olympics look like for the athletes who did accept? Athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports who have been eligible to compete as neutral athletes at Paris 2024 will participate as AINs (Individual Neutral Athlete or Athlete Individuel Neutre in French). It is the fourth successive Olympics where Russians are competing under an acronym. Before its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was already being sanctioned on the international sporting stage for a state-sponsored doping scandal. The last time it was able to compete at an Olympics under its own flag and with its own anthem was at the 2016 Rio Games. At the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Tokyo 2020 Summer Games, Russians who could prove they were clean competed as ROC (Russian Olympic Committee), while at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, they competed as OARs (Olympic Athletes of Russia). As ROC and OAR, they appeared as a group in the medal tables. But as AINs they will not - firstly because the IOC is not including their medals in their table of nations, but in any case they are individuals rather than a team. The IOC initially banned Russian and Belarusian athletes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Belarus is a close ally of Russia and supports its war in Ukraine. The IOC later decided athletes from the two countries would be able to participate as neutrals if they met strict eligibility conditions, saying that letting individuals take part was about ""respecting human rights"". Among the conditions are: Athletes must not actively support the war  Athletes must not be contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies (many Russian sports clubs have direct links to the military and security services) No teams are allowed Athletes had to qualify for the Games and then pass a double vetting check - first by their international sports federation and then by the IOC, which set up an Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel (AINERP) to evaluate eligibility against those conditions.  If they passed the checks, they were then invited by the IOC to participate at the Games. There will be no AIN track and field athletes because World Athletics has banned all Russians and Belarusians. The International Olympic Committee said last year it was expecting a maximum of 55 Russians and 28 Belarusians at Paris 2024, with 36 and 22 respectively the ""most probable scenario"". Just 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians have accepted invitations. That is in stark contrast to Tokyo 2020, where the ROC was one of the largest delegations with 335 competitors across 30 sports. They finished fifth in the medal table in Tokyo with 71 medals (20 gold, 28 silver, 23 bronze). Russia has dominated some events for many years and so the absence of so many of its competitors will open up chances for other countries.  This includes, for example, artistic swimming where Russians have won both the team and duet gold medals at the past six Games, and rhythmic gymnastics where Russia have won team and individual gold in five out of the past six Olympics.  Former world number one tennis player Daniil Medvedev is the most high-profile Russian set to take part. Also among the 15 Russians to accept an invitation are a further six tennis players, one trampoline gymnast, three canoeists, three road cyclists and one swimmer.  According to the IOC, nine of 10 invited wrestlers had initially accepted an invitation but have subsequently declined. The other declined immediately. Among the 21 to have turned down invitations are tennis players Andrey Rublev, Karen Khachanov and Daria Kasatkina and road cyclist Aleksandr Vlasov. Meanwhile, among the 17 Belarusians to accept an invitation is Ivan Litvinovich, who will be defending his men's trampoline title.  He is joined by another trampoline gymnast, three swimmers, two canoeists, two shooters, two rowers, two wrestlers, two weightlifters, one road cyclist and one taekwondo athlete. Among the seven Belarusians to have declined are two-time Grand Slam tennis champions Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka.  If an AIN is on the podium, the teal and white flag featuring the AIN logo will be raised at the medal ceremony.   Athletes may use this emblem on their kit, which must otherwise be white or unicolour.  The athletes cannot display any Russian or Belarusian colours, flags or emblems - and these are also banned from the venues.    You will not hear the Russian or Belarusian national anthems at medal ceremonies at Paris 2024. If an AIN wins gold then a specially written anthem with no lyrics will be played. No Russian or Belarusian government or state officials have been invited to or accredited for these Olympics. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last year that while he was in favour of Russians competing at the Games, a further assessment was needed of what the neutral status would mean for his country's athletes. ""If the IOC's artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all,"" he said. That was similar to the sentiment expressed by the Russian judo federation - a sport in which Putin himself is a black belt - when it said rejected any selection method ""aimed at... breaking the spirit of Russian athletes"". Russia has been critical of the IOC and its restrictions on its athletes, with its foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying the sporting body had ""slipped into racism and neo-Nazism"". When it announced its decision to allow AINs at the Games, the IOC said one of its considerations had been that an ""overwhelming majority of athletes"" did not want to ""punish fellow athletes for the actions of their government"". Ukraine's National Olympic Committee issued recommendations in May urging its athletes to avoid contact with Russians and Belarusians at Paris 2024 so that possible ""provocative actions"" can be prevented. Its recommendations also suggested Ukrainian athletes should not take part in news conferences or interviews with athletes from the two countries and to avoid being photographed with them at medal ceremonies.  Many Ukrainian athletes have already been avoiding handshakes with Russian and Belarusian opponents since the invasion.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last year that allowing Russia to compete at the Olympics would amount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable"", adding that there is no neutrality in sport while his country's athletes are dying on the battlefield. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said in March that Russian and Belarusian athletes were ""not welcome"" at the Games. The UK government, which had previously supported the IOC's ban on Russians and Belarusians, expressed support in April for the IOC's decision to allow them to compete in Paris as neutrals.",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0dd7j0l93yo,Sonia Oxley,2024-07-22 23:09:52,
641,The president's protectors are hardly noticeable - until things go wrong,"Within seconds of shots ringing out at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in western Pennsylvania, at least five protective agents in dark suits, white shirts and sunglasses sprinted into view. They leapt on stage where Trump stood, throwing themselves on top of him and shielding him from view, before ushering him into a waiting car. It looked like a picture of bravery, and of rigorous training. And yet, the near-miss that preceded the heroic scene is deemed by some to have been the worst security breach since the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. “It was a failed mission,” said Cheryl Tyler, a former Secret Service special agent and training instructor for the service. “It’s unacceptable.” President Joe Biden on Sunday called for an “independent review” of security measures at the rally. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Congress would conduct its own investigation into any “lapses” in security. And Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, has been called to testify before lawmakers at a hearing on Monday. But experts say last week’s episode will bring fresh scrutiny to the agency’s history, too, which includes a sometimes spotty record of mishaps and scandals that have risked the reputation of the presidents’ protectors. The Secret Service is tasked with a high-stakes and so-called zero-fail mission: to safeguard the US president, past presidents, presidential candidates and their families, at all costs. “The training is not easy. It’s rigorous and it’s long,” said Ms Tyler, who was the first black female agent assigned to a president’s protective service. “It’s not a 9 to 5 job. It is a lifestyle. It is a dedication to this country.” Since the 1968 assassination of Robert F Kennedy, who was shot and killed in the midst of his presidential campaign, the service has delivered on that high-stakes mission, she said. Those years of success allowed the agents to somewhat fade from view as only a quiet, stoic presence somewhere along the perimeter. “It’s almost as if you can forget about them when they’re doing their job,” said Matt Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University, who is writing a book on failed presidential assassination attempts. “But the Secret Service’s mistakes? Everyone learns about them.” And the agency has had its fair share of those. Beginning around 2011, the Secret Service suffered a series of lapses, ranging from the embarrassing to the downright alarming. In November that year, a man named Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired multiple shots from a semi-automatic rifle at the White House - meant to be one of the most closely-guarded properties in the world. And yet, the Secret Service was unaware for several days that at least seven bullets had hit the residence, while then-President Barack Obama’s daughter slept inside. In 2014, there was another major breach at the White House. Armed with a knife, Army veteran Omar Gonzalez jumped a fence onto the grounds and entered the White House through the front door and ran through much of the main floor before being tackled by an agent. A year later, in 2015, a drunk Secret Service agent drove a car through the White House compound, hitting a security barricade. In an unfortunate coincidence, security on the grounds had been on high-alert after someone had placed a package on the premises, and claimed it was a bomb. The drunk agent drove within inches of the suspicious package, according to a congressional report. And in another infamous episode from April 2012, reports emerged that several agents had solicited prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, ahead of then-President Barack Obama's visit.  Prostitution is legal in certain pockets of the country, but the incident - which reportedly followed a long night of heavy drinking - raised security and clearance concerns. It also added to the growing impression of the agency as a raucous fraternity, experts said.  A subsequent investigation by the House Oversight Committee found an email from a senior supervisor to 54 employees that his motto for the trip was “una mas cervesa por favor” - or, ""one more beer, please"". After an investigation, 10 agents were relieved from duty, with their security clearances revoked. By 2015, a House Oversight Committee report on the agency had declared it as being in crisis. “The incidents that we saw seemed like they were symptomatic of much larger problems at the Secret Service,” the report read.  “Wheels up, ring off”, was reportedly a running joke in the agency, meaning that on foreign assignments, marriage and other commitments were left behind at home. The atmosphere was demoralising for those agents who did work hard, according to the report. “For people who are serious about national security, about protection, [that reputation] is so embarrassing.” Experts say the attempted assassination of Donald Trump will force a reckoning. Ms Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, said ahead of the hearing that she would cooperate fully with any congressional or independent review into her agency. Director Cheatle “knows she’s going to be grilled”, said Ms Tyler, the former agent. “Records will be pulled, training records will be pulled, shooting records will be pulled, personnel actions will be pulled… They’re going to look at every single thing.” And the agency will be forced to reform, Ms Tyler said. “Will it be in the headlines of the newspaper? No, because they’re not going to tell you. But there will be changes.”",2024-07-22 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16j896003xo,Unknown,Unknown,
645,Disneyland workers say they live in cars and motels due to low pay,"Cynthia “Cyn” Carranza meticulously scavenged for a shady parking spot in the car she called home. The overnight custodian at Disneyland has to sleep during the day - a difficulty for anyone, let alone when you're living in your car with two dogs. Ms Carranza says she makes $20.65 an hour (about £15.99) at the park but last summer, she couldn't afford rent in this Southern California city where the average apartment can run more than $2,000 (about £1,550) a month. Ms Carranza teared up as she recounted the struggles of that summer, including sneaking for showers in Disneyland's costume department. She now shares a small apartment with her boyfriend, who also works at the park, but still makes barely enough to make ends meet. “That’s not something that anybody should experience working a full-time job for a company like Disney,” she told the BBC. Ms Carranza, like others who work at the park, detailed to the BBC the financial hardships that come with working at what’s supposed to be the “Happiest Place on Earth”. About 10,000 union workers at Disneyland - the first of 12 parks created around the globe - are threatening to strike over the wages and what they say are retaliatory anti-union practices. Hundreds of workers protested outside the park this week, with an array of signs and pins showing Mickey Mouse's gloved fist in defiance.  “Mickey would want fair pay,” workers chanted outside Disneyland near the park's gates.  They voted almost unanimously to authorise strike action on Friday, just days before union contract negotiations for workers are set to resume.  While the vote does not mean a strike is imminent, it could set workers up to act quickly if negotiations sour. Authorisation also gives the unions leverage as talks with Disney management continue again next week. The contract for cast members at Disneyland expired 16 June, and the current negotiations involves a coalition of unions that represent nearly 10,000 employees at the park, which includes everyone from those who work as characters and operate rides to sales, restaurant, and janitorial workers.  Union officials say about one in 10 Disneyland cast members have experienced homelessness while working at the park. A survey of employees showed 73% say they don't make enough to cover basic expenses each month and about a third said they experienced housing insecurity within the last year.  “We’re the ones who make the magic,” says L Slaughter, a host at the Toontown-themed part of the park. “We need Disney to pay us a liveable wage.” Ms Slaughter spent two years living in her car while working at the park. She now has a small apartment about an hour's drive from Disneyland.  She spent a lot of that time trying to find a safe parking spot to sleep, she says, adding that staff are not allowed to sleep in the Disneyland parking lots. “My rent just went up $200 and I won’t be able to make rent again,” she says. Ms Slaughter makes $19.90 an hour - thanks to a minimum wage mandate passed by city voters in 2018. Disney unsuccessfully fought the wage hike, but workers say it’s still not enough to survive in Southern California. A living wage calculator built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, says a single person with no children would need to be paid $30.48 an hour to afford to live near Disneyland in Orange County, which is about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Workers who talked to the BBC said they have kept their jobs at the park because they love the Disney brand, and they rely on the generous healthcare benefits and union-operated food bank, which some workers described as a saving-grace.  Disney says it is committed to negotiations with its “cast members” - the company's term for employees who play princesses and pirates as well as the chefs or janitors who maintain the park. ""We respect and value our cast members and recognize the important role they play in creating happiness for our guests,"" Disney said in a statement, adding that talks with the unions representing its workers will resume 22 July and they are committed to reaching a deal ""that focuses on what matters most to our current cast members, helps us attract new cast, and positions Disneyland Resort for growth and the creation of more jobs"". The last Disneyland strike was in 1984, and it lasted 22 days. Ms Carranza described the back-breaking work she does nightly at the park - cleaning, polishing, repairing floors and sometimes installing carpets. She said last summer living in her car was the lowest point in her life, and she credits her dogs with keeping her alive. “I know that they’re the reason why I’m still here, why I didn’t let go,"" she said. ""There were times when I questioned what I was doing here and how I was going to get back on my feet.""  But even with the small studio apartment Ms Carranza now has, she says she's still living paycheck-to-paycheck and sometimes can only afford to eat rice or noodles.  Although workers’ demands are economic, the vote to strike was called in response to complaints that workers were disciplined for wearing the Mickey badges and distributing union information in the park.  In June, the unions filed unfair labour practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney for “unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work.” Colleen Palmer, one of the negotiators from Local UFCW 324, has worked at Disneyland for nearly 37 years and makes almost $24 an hour as a “merchandise hostess”. She says she wore her union badge for less than half an hour before management told her to take it off. Palmer says workers are responsible for the experience that customers enjoy at Disneyland, and that her loyalty and experience should be rewarded. She said workers believe the pay gap between the workers and the company’s executives is outrageous: Disney CEO Bob Iger’s compensation was $31.6 million in 2023 - hundreds of times the amount Disneyland cast members earn. “It makes me wonder, why don’t you want to recognize me? Because I’m making you that money, so that you can buy that sports team now,” she said, referring to news that Mr Iger and his wife had taken over the LA women’s soccer team, Angel City Football Club. The disparity between workers pay and management has been fuelling labour unrest in the United States. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, CEO compensation rose 1,460 percent between 1978 and 2021. Disneyland is a unique workplace. Many consider it a career, not a job, and workers are often also fans of the Disney brand - some call it the cult of Disney. Workers get perks like free admission to Disney parks for their family and friends. But they also say Disney is not flexible when they have a family crisis or get sick. Many have second and third jobs that Disneyland's unpredictable schedules make challenging to juggle. For students and retirees working part-time, it can be a dream job, but it no longer provides a living wage for people in and around Anaheim, a wealthy city whose biggest employer is Disney, workers say. “Without us, Disney would be like anywhere else,” says Morgan, who lived in motels around Disneyland for four years with his children and wanted to be identified by his middle name only. The breakup of Morgan’s marriage caused him to lose his housing and cheap motels were all he could afford with his Disney wages.  When his children were with their mother, he often slept outside and hid in shadows to avoid police or theft.  He now has a second full-time job as a recruiter - which he can do from home - and an apartment he can afford with the combined income. Still, he takes pride in his job selling Disney merchandise and says every cast member takes the job seriously. “It’s not the animatronics - it’s us. At least respect us enough to pay us a decent wage.”",2024-07-22 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gpx7pnwdo,Unknown,Unknown,
644,Oxygen discovery defies knowledge of the deep ocean,"Scientists have discovered “dark oxygen” being produced in the deep ocean, apparently by lumps of metal on the seafloor. About half the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean. But, before this discovery, it was understood that it was made by marine plants photosynthesising - something that requires sunlight.  Here, at depths of 5km, where no sunlight can penetrate, the oxygen appears to be produced by naturally occurring metallic “nodules” which split seawater - H2O - into hydrogen and oxygen.  Several mining companies have plans to collect these nodules, which marine scientists fear could disrupt the newly discovered process - and damage any marine life that depends on the oxygen they make. “I first saw this in 2013 -  an enormous amount of oxygen being produced at the seafloor in complete darkness,” explains lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman from the Scottish Association for Marine Science. “I just ignored it, because I’d been taught -  you only get oxygen through photosynthesis. “Eventually, I realised that for years I’d been ignoring this potentially huge discovery,” he told BBC News. He and his colleagues carried out their research in an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico - part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with these metal nodules. The nodules form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.      And because these nodules contain metals like lithium, cobalt and copper - all of which are needed to make batteries - many mining companies are developing technology to collect them and bring them to the surface.  But Prof Sweetman says the dark oxygen they make could also support life on the seafloor. And his discovery, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, raises new concerns about the risks of proposed deep-sea mining ventures. The scientists worked out that the metal nodules are able to make oxygen precisely because they act like batteries. “If you put a battery into seawater, it starts fizzing,” explained Prof Sweetman. “That’s because the electric current is actually splitting seawater into oxygen and hydrogen [which are the bubbles]. We think that’s happening with these nodules in their natural state.” “It's like a battery in a torch,” he added. “You put one battery in, it doesn't light up. You put two in and you've got enough voltage to light up the torch. So when the nodules are sitting at the seafloor in contact with one another, they’re working in unison - like multiple batteries.” The researchers put this theory to the test in the lab, collecting and studying the potato-sized metal nodules. Their experiments measured the voltages on the surface of each metallic lump - essentially the strength of the electric current. They found it to be almost equal to the voltage in a typical AA-sized battery.  This means, they say, that the nodules sitting on the seabed could generate electric currents large enough to split, or electrolyse, molecules of seawater. The researchers think the same process - battery-powered oxygen production that requires no light and no biological process - could be happening on other moons and planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.  The Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where the discovery was made, is a site already being explored by a number of seabed mining companies, which are developing technology to collect the nodules and bring them to a ship at the surface. The US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that this seabed mining could “result in the destruction of life and the seabed habitat in the mined areas”.  More than 800 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity. New species are being discovered in the deep ocean all the time - it is often said that we know more about the surface of the Moon than we do about the deep sea. And this discovery suggests that the nodules themselves could be providing the oxygen to support life there. Prof Murray Roberts, a marine biologist from the Univerisity of Edinburgh is one of the scientists who signed the seabed mining petition. “There’s already overwhelming evidence that strip mining deep-sea nodule fields will destroy ecosystems we barely understand,” he told BBC News. “Because these fields cover such huge areas of our planet it would be crazy to press ahead with deep-sea mining knowing they may be a significant source of oxygen production.” Prof Sweetman added: “I don't see this study as something that will put an end to mining. “[But] we need to explore it in greater detail and we need to use this information and the data we gather in future if we are going to go into the deep ocean and mine it in the most environmentally friendly way possible.” Hear on this story on the 5 Questions On podcast on BBC Sounds",2024-07-22 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728ven2v9eo,Unknown,Unknown,
646,Why you are probably sitting for too long,"In the office, on transport, at home…Sitting down is ingrained in most peoples' days. But, due in part to vascular dysfunction, staying sedentary for too long can increase the risk of serious health conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In 1953, epidemiologist Jeremy Morris found that London bus drivers were more than twice as likely as bus conductors to develop coronary heart disease. Demographically (in age, sex and income range) the two groups of workers were the same, so why was there such a significant difference?  Morris' answer: bus conductors were required to be on their feet and regularly climb the steps of London's iconic double-decker buses as they sold tickets to passengers, whereas the drivers remained seated for long stretches of time. His landmark study laid the groundwork for research on the links between physical activity and coronary health.  Whilst London bus conductors may now be a thing of the past, Morris' results are more relevant than ever. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a huge shift towards working from home, which is likely to increase our collective sitting time. Without the trips to the water cooler and trot from meeting room to meeting room, it's easy to spend hours sat behind a desk without getting up. (Office culture, however, had already changed our working lives so much by the 1980s that some researchers joked that our species had become Homo sedens – the ""seated man"" – rather than Homo sapiens.) Prolonged sitting is a form of sedentary behaviour, characterised by a highly reduced energy expenditure in a seated or reclined position. Typical sedentary behaviours including television-watching, gaming, driving and desk-bound work. Sedentary behaviours are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and premature mortality, and the time we spend sitting down in particular has been identified as an independent risk factor in a range of health conditions. In 2020, the World Health Organization suggested measures to reduce sedentary behaviour. Since 2010, researchers have been keen to point out that sedentary behaviour is distinct from a lack of physical activity. You can get sufficient exercise per day, and still sit for too long. However, the risks of sedentary behaviour are heightened for those who do not exercise enough. Why does sedentary behaviour increase risk of cardiovascular disease? The primary hypothesis is increased vascular dysfunction, particularly in the legs. The vascular system is responsible for keeping blood and lymph fluid – which forms part of the immune system – moving through the blood vessels. David Dunstan, a physiologist at Deakin University's Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, in Melbourne, Australia, has extensively researched the effects of prolonged sitting and possible interventions. ""What characterises sitting is a reduction in muscular activity,"" says Dunstan. ""If I'm on a chair, the chair is taking all the responsibility there."" The combined effect of reduced muscular activity, lower metabolic demand and gravitational forces decreases peripheral blood flow to the leg muscles, which can lead to blood pooling in the calves. The biomechanics of sitting, with the legs usually bent, can also reduce blood flow. Reduced muscular activity of the leg muscles reduces their metabolic demand. Metabolic demand is the primary determinant of blood flow, so blood flow in the legs is also reduced. The biomechanics of sitting, with the legs usually bent can cause to blood pool in the calves – one study of 21 young healthy volunteers saw their calves increase in circumference by nearly 1cm (0.4in) over the course of two hours. This can also reduce blood flow.   Recommended by the editor Earlier this year, my colleagues and I looked at some simple ways you can improve your physcial and mental health. We discovered it might not matter that much if you hit 10,000 steps everyday, but there are some types of exercise that can really make a difference. I was also reminded while editing this piece that even fidgeting while sat on a long phone call can have its benefits. Here are some other articles I went back to read again after this one: From Richard Gray, Editor  Normal blood flow provides friction, known as arterial shear stress, against the endothelial cells which line the walls of blood vessels. The endothelium responds to this force and secretes vasodilators, like adenosine, prostacyclin and nitric oxide, which keep the vessels sufficiently dilated and maintain the ability of the vascular system to regulate itself – known as homeostasis. Reduced blood flow, however, reduces shear stress, and the endothelium produces vasoconstrictors like endothelin-1 which cause the blood vessels to narrow. In a vicious cycle, vasoconstriction further reduces blood flow, and blood pressure rises to keep the blood moving. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the predominant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ""That's [vascular dysfunction] one of the potential mechanisms,"" says Dunstan. ""But the truth is that we haven't been able to pinpoint the exact mechanisms, and there's likely to be multiple.  Whilst the underlying mechanisms are hypothetical, recent studies support the theory. A study with 16 young, healthy men found that sitting for three-hour periods increased blood pooling in the legs, peripheral vascular resistance, diastolic blood pressure and leg circumference. Another study finds that blood pressure increases with time spent sitting uninterrupted. Researchers generally agree that 120-180 minutes of uninterrupted sitting is probably the threshold at which you have probably spent too long in a seated position, but vascular dysfunction generally increases with time spent sitting. Sitting for a prolonged period after a high-fat meal is thought to be particularly harmful. The muscular skeletal system is also likely to be affected. Prolonged sitting contributes to reduced muscle strength, lower bone density and increased total and visceral fat in adipose tissue. Additionally, prolonged sitting is associated with physical discomfort, stress at work and higher depression, and can even lead to pressure ulcers. Dunstan, who specialises in researching type 2 diabetes, also notes that sedentary behaviour increases post-meal, or post-prandial, rises in blood glucose and insulin. Impaired insulin sensitivity and impaired vascular function, both contribute to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Given all these well-known potential consequences, why is it that we sit for so long – and can we break the habit? ""I think people are becoming more sedentary because it's what society has encouraged,"" says Benjamin Gardner, a social psychologist specialising in habitual behaviour at the University of Surrey, who has been researching why people sit for so long. ""It's not that anyone's deliberately pushing it. It's just as things get more efficient, we don't have to move around so much."" In 2018, Gardner and colleagues found that encouraging standing in meetings presented unique social obstacles. ""We encouraged people to try this [standing up] in three different meetings, and we interviewed them after each one to find out how they got on, and the findings were fascinating,"" says Gardner. ""In a formal meeting, it was felt it was not appropriate to be standing."" Other interventions include height-adjustable workstations, sit/stand chairs, treadmill workstations, and fidgeting the legs which enhances blood flow. (Learn more about why fidgeting is good for you.) Just getting up every-so-often and going for a light walk or climbing some stairs has also been shown to be beneficial. Wearable technology may also help nudge us into action. In a promising new study, wearable devices called accelerometers provided 24-hour data on individual behaviour patterns including sitting, standing, sleeping and exercising. As Dunstan pointed out, this potentially allows for tailored optimal sitting and standing times, with devices then sending automatic reminders whenever we sit for too long. However, the use of technology is not without its drawbacks, as some may become frustrated by or desensitised to its prompts. Above all, Gardner and colleagues encourage moving between sitting and standing positions more frequently. The premise of breaking up sedentary time by just standing up is simple, but has significant health benefits, particularly for low-activity individuals. For wheelchair users or others with mobility constraints, specific, adapted exercises can be beneficial. For many, sedentary behaviour can seem like an unavoidable consequence of modern life and work. But even small changes to your routine – be it stretching more, fidgeting or standing up to make a cup of tea – can help break your sitting habit. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

642,Mass killer who ‘hunted’ black people says police encouraged him,"A convicted South African murderer who shot dead dozens of black men during apartheid has told the BBC the police sanctioned his violence. Louis van Schoor says others should share the blame for the killings he carried out as a security guard. But in talking to BBC Africa Eye over the past four years, he has also let slip horrifying details that raise serious questions about his early release from prison. Standing in the bedroom of a killer, your eyes naturally hone in on the details. Van Schoor’s bed is immaculately neat - the duvet so flat it looks like it has been ironed. The air is heavy with the smell of cigarettes, their stubs piled high in an ashtray. Strips of sticky paper are dangling from the ceiling, writhing with trapped and dying flies. The so-called “Apartheid Killer” has lost his teeth. His health is waning. Following a heart attack, both his legs were recently amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair, with painful scars. When his surgeon carried out this procedure, Van Schoor requested an epidural instead of a general anaesthetic - so he could watch them remove his legs. “I was curious,” he said, chuckling. “I saw them cutting… they sawed through the bone.” In speaking to the BBC World Service, Van Schoor wanted to persuade us that he is “not the monster that people say I am”. His enthusiastic description of his legs being removed did little to soften his image. Over a three-year period in the 1980s under the country’s racist apartheid system - which imposed a strict hierarchy that privileged white South Africans - Van Schoor shot and killed at least 39 people. All of his victims were black. The youngest was just 12 years old. The killings occurred in East London, a city in South Africa’s windswept Eastern Cape. Van Schoor was a security guard at the time, with a contract to protect as many as 70% of white-owned businesses: restaurants, shops, factories and schools. He has long claimed that everyone he killed was a “criminal” who he caught red-handed breaking into these buildings. “He was a kind of vigilante killer. He was a Dirty Harry character,” says Isa Jacobson, a South African journalist and filmmaker, who has spent 20 years investigating Van Schoor’s case. “These were intruders who were, in a lot of cases, pretty desperate. Digging through bins, maybe stealing some food… petty criminals.” The Apartheid Killer Watch on iPlayer (UK only) or on Monday 22 July at 23:05 on BBC Two (Northern Ireland 23:35). Outside the UK, watch on the BBC Africa YouTube channel.  Van Schoor’s killings - sometimes several in a single night - struck terror into the black community of East London. Stories spread through the city of a bearded man - nicknamed “whiskers” in the Xhosa language - who made people disappear at night. But his shootings were not carried out in secret. Every killing between 1986 and 1989 was reported to the police by Van Schoor himself. But the release from prison of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in 1990 signalled an end to this impunity. Ripples of change swept across South Africa and, following pressure from activists and journalists, the security guard was arrested in 1991. Van Schoor’s trial was one of the largest murder trials in South Africa’s history, involving dozens of witnesses and thousands of pages of forensic evidence. However, the case against him largely collapsed in court. At the time of his trial, much of the apparatus of the apartheid system was still in place within the judiciary. Despite killing at least 39 people, he was only convicted of seven murders. He would go on to serve just 12 years in prison. His other 32 killings are still classified as “justifiable homicides” by the police. Apartheid-era laws gave people the right to use lethal force against intruders if they resisted arrest or fled once caught. Van Schoor relied heavily on this defence to maintain his innocence, claiming that his victims were running away when he killed them. The BBC’s investigation into Van Schoor scrutinised the evidence underlying these so-called “justifiable” shootings, delving deep into long-forgotten police reports, autopsies and witness statements. The investigation was led by Isa Jacobson, and involved years of archival research in multiple cities across the Eastern Cape. The most important files were scattered among hundreds of boxes, hidden away in vaults. “The whole scale of it is just mesmerising,” she said. “It's astounding that any court of law could allow this to happen.” Some of the most harrowing evidence Ms Jacobson found were witness statements from people who were injured by Van Schoor, but survived. These accounts contradict the security guard’s argument that they had been running away when he shot them. Multiple people said Van Schoor shot them while their hands were up, after they had surrendered. Others describe him toying with them, asking if they would prefer to be arrested or shot - before shooting them in the chest. Another victim described being shot in the abdomen, begging for water, before being kicked in his wound by Van Schoor. The security guard was armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, frequently loaded with hollow-point bullets, which cause severe internal ruptures when entering a victim. In one case, he fired eight shots into an unarmed man. In a particularly brutal case on 11 July 1988, Van Schoor shot a 14-year-old boy who had broken into a restaurant searching for petty change. The boy - who we have not named to protect his privacy - told the police he hid in the toilet when he saw Van Schoor with his gun. He says the security guard called him out, told him to stand next to the wall, and then shot him repeatedly. “He told me to stand up, but I couldn’t,” said the boy, in his recorded testimony. “While I was lying there, he kicked me in the mouth. He picked me up and propped me up against a table and then he shot me again.” The boy survived, but he was not believed. He was charged for breaking into the building. Many young black men and boys who gave first-hand accounts of being assaulted and shot by Van Schoor faced a similar fate. Testimonies such as this were heard during Van Schoor’s trial, but the judge repeatedly dismissed the witnesses as “unsophisticated” and “unreliable”. There are no jury trials in South Africa. The opinion of the judge is final. World of Secrets, Season 3: The Apartheid Killer A new six-episode season from the BBC’s global investigations podcast. A BBC World Service investigation. Listen now on BBC Sounds. If you are outside of the UK click here. At the time of Van Schoor’s trial, many members of the white community in East London supported him. One entrepreneurial businessman printed bumper stickers with pictures of the security guard. They said “I Love Louis”, next to a heart full of bullet holes. “There was evident racial bias in the legal system,” says Patrick Goodenough, a South African journalist who led the 1980s investigation into Van Schoor. He also attended his trial. “The support for him was massive… He would not have been able to get away with a fraction of what he got away with without it.” There is no statute of limitations for murder or attempted murder in South Africa. In theory, there is nothing stopping the police from reopening Van Schoor’s case and re-assessing these “justifiable” shootings. “Louis van Schoor was basically going out and murdering people for sport,” says Dominic Jones, a journalist who helped raise awareness of the security guard’s killing spree in the 1980s. Some of the most shocking findings from the BBC's investigation came from interviews with Van Schoor himself, which strongly suggested he got a thrill from his activities. “Every night is a new adventure, if you want to put it that way,” he told the BBC. Many of the businesses he protected installed silent alarms. When someone broke in, Van Schoor would receive an alert which allowed him to surprise the intruder - and identify exactly where they were inside the building. And he always went alone. “I was barefoot. It’s quiet. You don’t have your shoes squeaking on tiles and stuff,” he said. He would never switch the light on. Instead, he relied on his sense of smell. “If somebody breaks in, the adrenaline gives off an odour. And you can pick that up,” he said. Van Schoor claims he never went out “with the intention of killing black people” and says he is not a racist. But he admits he found stalking them in the dark “exciting”. Before becoming a security guard, Van Schoor was a member of the East London police force for 12 years. He used to handle what he calls “attacker dogs”, which he used to track down and catch protesters and criminals - almost all of whom were black.  He compared this to “hunting, but a different species”. Tetinene “Joe” Jordan, a former anti-apartheid activist who was operating in East London at the time of Van Schoor’s killings, remembers this well. “He was hunting, literally hunting people,” he says. Van Schoor strongly denies he is a “serial killer” and believes everything he did was “within the law”. If people feel aggrieved over his killings, he says they should blame the South African police. He says the police never criticised or warned him, but actively supported and encouraged him. “Every officer in East London knew what was going on… all the police officers knew,” he said. “Not once did anybody say ‘Hey Louis, you’re on the borderline or you should cool it or whatever’… they all knew what was happening.” In the police records held in public archives, Ms Jacobson found instances of killings where officers had been present at the time of the shootings. At no point did they appear to question Van Schoor as a suspect. In many instances, the police failed to take photos of the deceased at the scenes of shooting and failed to collect key forensic evidence, such as bullet casings. Van Schoor was often the only witness to his shootings, so this evidence could have been crucial for determining what had actually happened in each case. “These were cover-ups… He had the backing from police officers from junior rank and senior rank,” said Mr Goodenough. “They wouldn’t investigate. They’d sit down with him and have a cigarette while chatting, with bodies lying nearby.” In all cases Van Schoor pulled the trigger - but between the police and the businesses that hired him, an entire community played a role in the killings which took place in East London.  “Van Schoor was a serial killer because there was a society that allowed him to be one,” says Ms Jacobson. For the relatives of Van Schoor’s victims, his freedom, and the failure of the state to thoroughly investigate his killings, is a constant source of pain. Some never recovered the bodies of their loved ones. “It seems like we are stuck in this phase of being heartbroken, being angry,” says Marlene Mvumbi, whose brother, Edward, was murdered by Van Schoor in 1987. His remains were dumped in an unmarked grave by the authorities without the family’s consent. “Lots of people are still missing and not even in the graveyard… there is no closure.” Van Schoor’s case pre-dated South Africa’s 1995 Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which gave compensation to many victims of apartheid-era crimes. Sharlene Crage, a former activist who played a key role in pressuring the South African authorities to prosecute Van Schoor, is outraged that he was ever allowed to walk free. “It’s a shocking miscarriage of justice,” she said. “There is no reason his case shouldn’t be reopened.” Van Schoor was sentenced to more than 90 years in prison at the conclusion of his trial in 1992, but the judge allowed him to serve each term concurrently. He was freed on parole in 2004. The early release of apartheid-era killers from prison has become a contentious issue in South Africa. In 2022, there were protests in Johannesburg over the parole of Janusz Walus, who killed anti-apartheid politician Chris Hani. A few years previously, Eugene de Kock, in charge of a death squad responsible for the abduction, torture, and murder of dozens of black activists was also freed. Nowadays, Van Schoor spends most of his time watching rugby, smoking and playing with his pet rottweiler, Brutus. He says he has no memory of many of his killings. Some reports have stated, without verification, that he shot as many as 100 people. Van Schoor denies this, but concedes his number of shootings may exceed the documented number of 39. “I honestly don’t know how many I shot. Some say over a 100, some say 40… Let’s say for argument’s sake I shot 50 people,” he told us. He says he is proud of his past actions. “I don’t feel any guilt,” he said. “I’ve got no remorse inside.” The BBC contacted the South African police for comment, but they did not respond. The authorities have given no explanation for why Van Schoor’s killings have not been reassessed in the post-apartheid era. “There is too much pain, and for now I don’t feel that there is enough that is done for us to heal,” says Marlene Mvumbi. “It’s not only the ones that were killed by Van Schoor. The ones that have similar stories from the killings of the apartheid regime.” Investigation by Isa Jacobson and Charlie Northcott",2024-07-22 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yqdy3q61o,Unknown,Unknown,
643,Summer surge: why Covid-19 isn't yet seasonal,"Covid-19 doesn't follow normal seasonal patterns, like other respiratory viruses – waves of infection can happen at any time of year. Every July for the past four years, epidemiologists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have noted a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations, an annual trend which has been dubbed ""the summertime surge"". This summer in the United States, Covid-19 rates are reportedly particularly high in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada. In these western states, the number of positive tests reached 15.6% on the week ending July 6th, 1% up on the previous week. The CDC’s investigations show that viral rates in wastewater are also on the rise once again. A similar trend has played out on the other side of the Atlantic, where according to the UK's Health Security Agency, positive Covid-19 tests rose from 4% at the end of March to 14% by the end of June. The recent rise has been attributed to the FLiRT subvariants, the latest evolution of the Omicron strain of Covid-19 which emerged towards the end of 2021. This new raft of subvariants is the inevitable consequence of the virus trying out new mutations in its spike protein – a structure which is essential for Covid-19's ability to enter human cells, but can also alert the human immune system to the virus' presence in the body. As a result, Covid-19 has found more effective ways of evading the neutralising antibodies within most of our immune systems, while still being capable of locking onto the ACE2 receptor, a protein on human cells in the respiratory tract which allows it to enter the body. (Find out more about how Covid-19's symptoms have changed as new varients have emerged.) According to Shan-Lu Liu, who directs the Viruses and Emerging Pathogens Program at The Ohio State University and has studied the FLiRT subvariants, these latest Covid-19 viruses have managed to strike a balance between escaping the immune system and still being able to bind to cells, which is driving many of the new cases.  “The elderly and immunosuppressed are particularly vulnerable to new subvariants due to their weakened immune responses to vaccination and natural infection,"" says Liu. He explains that experts recommend that these groups receive booster shots including the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine. This was designed to target the Omicron XBB 1.5 subvariant of Covid-19, which emerged in 2022. Given the need to protect society’s most vulnerable, studying these continually emerging variants remains crucial for updating the world’s Covid-19 vaccines. Based on work done by Liu and others, US regulators and the World Health Organization have been able to make specific recommendations regarding new vaccine targets based on the latest spike protein mutations, in time for the latest Covid vaccine rollout in the autumn. Yet for the scientists who monitor how SARS-CoV-2 is evolving and changing, it is still almost impossible to predict when the next strains of note will emerge. While most common respiratory infections like influenza or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) follow seasonal patterns, surging during the autumn or winter months before abating in the spring and summer, Covid-19 is yet to settle into such a distinctive cycle. In the wake of the latest summer outbreak, it remains to seen whether Covid-19 will ever become a truly seasonal virus, and if so, how long that will take. According to epidemiologists and medical researchers, there are three main factors which drive cases of infectious disease – the virus itself, how many humans are susceptible at a particular time, and the conditions for the virus to spread. ""Seasonality is a characteristic shared by many viruses, most famously the flu's yearly winter endemic,"" says El Hussain Shamsa, an internal-medicine physician at University Hospitals in Ohio, who published a 2023 study on Covid-19 patterns throughout the year. In this case, it's thought that environmental and behavioural factors could lead to lower immunity and higher transmission of flu viruses in the winter, he says.  However, even influenza never fully goes away. Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University, explains that the summer Covid-19 wave is likely to be partially exacerbated by factors such as people gathering in close proximity at festivals and concerts, and the heavy use of air conditioning which dries the air and encourages viral spread. As an example, infection transmission experts in the UK suggest that an increase in people gathering in crowded pub gardens and bars to follow this summer’s Euro 2024 football tournament is likely to be behind many of the country’s recent Covid-19 cases. ""The latest data suggests that June’s cases peaked around the week of June 17, shortly after England’s first game,"" says Paul Hunter, a virology consultant and professor at the University of East Anglia. ""Cases then began picking up again in July as England progressed through the tournament."" But this still leaves the question of why this year-round effect is mainly being seen with Covid-19 rather than other respiratory infections? Scientists believe that this is because population immunity is far higher with many of the usual seasonal viruses, such as influenza, rhinovirus, and RSV. One reason is that they have simply been around for much longer, meaning they need more ideal conditions to infect us which only come around during the autumn and winter months as temperatures drop, schools return, and people gather more indoors. (Learn more about how diseases spread when we talk and sing.) Because Covid-19 is still a relatively new virus, our sterilising immunity – the body’s ability to eliminate a pathogen before it has the chance to start replicating – is considerably lower. Scientists feel this is exacerbated by low vaccination rates, making population immunity dependent on how many people were infected during the most recent wave. Shamsa points out that the current FLiRT variants share common immune-evading mutations with the Covid-19 variants which drove the previous major surge in infections during the winter of 2023, allowing them to fully capitalise on waning immunity levels. According to the CDC, as of July 7, just 22.7% of over-18s in the US are up to date on their Covid-19 vaccines, compared to 48.2% for influenza. As a result, Hunter says that anyone who didn’t catch Covid-19 over the winter, will have very little immunity against the FLiRT variants, driving the current spate of cases.  ""With Covid-19, I think many people just don’t want or think they need the vaccine, but this means that population immunity waxes and wanes almost in unison based on the frequency and intensity of recent prior waves,"" says Denis Nash, an epidemiology professor at The City University of New York. So will Covid-19 ever transition to a more seasonal pattern as human exposure to the virus increases? Some feel that this trend is already emerging, with Hunter pointing out that the summertime surge of cases, hospitalisations and deaths is much milder than that seen during December and January. In the US, 327 people died from Covid-19 during the week of June 15, compared to 2,578 during the week of January 13. ""It may be that we won’t ever reach a level of population immunity against SARS-CoV-2 that drives summer cases to zero, or it may take another year or two for us to get there,"" says Andy Pekosz, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. However, Nash predicts that this process may take decades or even longer, pointing out that humans have been living with and exposed to influenza and other common viruses for hundreds of years. If Covid-19 does find a stable seasonal pattern, it raises the question of where an annual peak would fit in amongst the spikes we already see from RSV, which peaks during early autumn, and seasonal flu, which reaches its height in mid-winter. Pekosz describes the concept of ""virus interference"", which means that over time pathogens evolve into cycles which prevent too many viruses circulating simultaneously. ""This is because the first one would infect people and cause a period of nonspecific immunity against other viruses,"" he says. More like this: • Could Long Concussion help solve Long Covid? • How Covid-19 symptoms have changed • Why a 'tripledemic' comes in waves These are all still questions which could take years or decades to properly answer. Yet some scientists suspect that Covid-19 may never completely disappear during the summer periods, due to the innate properties of coronaviruses which allow them to continue circulating even during warmer weather. ""We’ve known for some time that human coronaviruses are not as seasonal as flu, which is certainly helped along by cold temperatures and dry conditions,"" says Harvard epidemiologist Bill Hanage. ""Indeed before 2020, we used to call coronavirus infections summer colds because they were less obviously skewed towards the colder months, so this is not a surprise."" Whatever happens, for now, experts feel that because Covid-19 is still having such a consistent year-round impact, there is a need for more public health messaging to ensure that the most vulnerable people remain fully vaccinated and have access to necessary antivirals on a year-round basis. ""No public health experts who are really paying attention would set expectations around the seasonality of Covid at this point,"" says Nash. ""If messaging was accurate, it would be telling people that they should be up to date all year round, not just in the fall and winter."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

648,'Schauffele passes ultimate examination in classic Open',"This video can not be played Schauffele wins The Open While Xander Schauffele celebrates completing the first American shutout of the four men's majors in 42 years, it is worth reflecting on the maddening magnificence of UK links golf at its highest level. It is, undoubtedly, the sport in its purest and best form. Schauffele won a classic Open at Royal Troon - a course that provided the ultimate test while the elements, for sustained periods, threw their worst at the world's finest golfers. Ultimately the championship was won by the right man, as the 30-year-old Olympic champion collected his second major of 2024. For all Scottie Scheffler's recent success, Schauffele richly deserves the moniker 'champion golfer of the year'. This Open had everything - unlikely challengers, big-name casualties and a stunning performance to snatch the Claret Jug. Those four days on the Ayrshire coast amounted almost to a different sport compared with the sultry heat and generous course set-up that prevailed at Valhalla in May, when Schauffele won the US PGA to land his first major title. Troon provided the ultimate examination.  The unfamiliar winds of the first two days undid the maxim that scores are made on the front nine and retained, if you are good enough, on the ultra-challenging inward half. The traditional Troon test was turned on its head. These unexpected conditions bamboozled the likes of Rory McIlroy, and the man who dramatically beat him to last month's US Open - Bryson DeChambeau. Much-vaunted debutant Ludwig Aberg also took an early bath as shot-making limitations of many top stars were ruthlessly exposed. Formulaic demands of the PGA Tour, where bomb and gouge to receptive greens is such a profitable pursuit, were not the qualities required last week. Deep bunkers with steep faces terrorised this Open field.  Shots needed shaping to use winds as cushions to land balls in correct spots. Chips from tight links turf required absolute precision, often putters were the correct option.  Keeping the ball low, imaginatively using this glorious golfing terrain was the order of the day. Maintaining mental fortitude as cold rain drove sideways late on the Saturday afternoon was crucial to ensuring title hopes were not blown away. These are the demands of golf in its purest form. Justin Rose and Billy Horschel - the 54-hole leader - played as if their lives depended on it - celebrating par putts that kept them prominent on the distinctive yellow leaderboards overlooking the home green. Shane Lowry raged at the tough course set-up.  The fact drivers were needed to reach the green on the long par-three 17th was irksome to the Irishman. He did little wrong in the Saturday 77 that ultimately cost him his tilt at a second Open title. And he had a point, to an extent. But with modern ball and club technology available to today's superstars, it was refreshing to see them tested to the extreme. And it was his cold putter on that frigid late Saturday afternoon that did for him. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from the 152nd Open Championship This was golf being played as the game's Scottish founding fathers experienced it back in the 19th Century, when the first Opens were played down the road at Prestwick. Schauffele was calmness personified throughout these four ultra-demanding days.  He carded only six bogeys, two of them in the worst of the third-round conditions. Stay out of the bunkers was a key maxim. He visited only three, and successfully got up and down on two of those occasions. Do not fall foul of the tiny Postage Stamp eighth was another. He birdied it three times, and will feel he should have had a full set having given himself a great look on his final visit to that magical par three. With the title on the line he hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation. He was the only man to birdie the treacherous 11th, where his six-iron approach from the left rough to inside three feet was arguably the shot of the tournament. His delicate chip to the par-five 16th was a shot of sheer class, having seen his plucky pursuer Rose smash a 300-yard driver off the deck on to the green. The Englishman was one poor pitch - at the 12th - from pushing Schauffele all the way to the end. His five on that hole was the only bogey between them in a fabulous display of links golf. Easing away with his four back-nine birdies, the champion demonstrated supreme ball-striking and clinical putting. That is champion golf, worthy of the greatest event on the calendar. ""That walk up 18 truly is the coolest with the yellow leaderboards and the fans and the standing ovation,"" Schauffele reflected as he tightly clutched the precious Claret Jug. ""It really is one of the coolest feelings I've ever had in my life."" Schauffele is the only player to have finished top 10 in all four majors. At the PGA he set a new scoring record by finishing 21 under par, but his nine-under tally in Scotland was even more impressive. He is the 11th successive first-time winner of the Open - a run started when Phil Mickelson made a similar bolt from the pack in 2013. Such a record shows the championship is truly 'open' and rewards the best player in that given week. That is competitive golf in a nutshell. Schauffele was already one of the two best players in the world, and the time-honoured demands of links golf - in its most hostile form - ensured that only someone of such elevated status could prevail. The 152nd Open should be remembered as a classic. Roll on Royal Portrush in 12 months' time.",2024-07-22 23:09:54,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cv2g1glwypqo,Iain Carter,2024-07-22 16:09:54,
649,Ferdinand's persuasive powers sealed Man Utd's Yoro deal,"Leny Yoro has played for France at every level from under-17 to under-23 Manchester United had a helping hand from legendary defender Rio Ferdinand in persuading highly rated Leny Yoro to join them. Centre-back Yoro was coveted by many of Europe's top clubs, including Real Madrid, this summer. In the end, he plumped for United, signing a five-year contract after agreeing a £52m move from French club Lille. Ferdinand sent Yoro a social media message welcoming him to Old Trafford and, speaking to in-house club media, 18-year-old Yoro explained the former England star had already adopted a more direct approach. ""Two weeks ago, he called me,"" said Yoro. ""We spoke for 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice."" ""He mainly spoke about the club and what it's like. That this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. ""It was really good to speak about this."" Yoro impressed on his debut in the pre-season victory over Rangers at Murrayfield. And, judging by his assessment of his own abilities, there are similarities between Yoro's style and that of Ferdinand, who joined United for £29.1m from Leeds 22 years ago. ""The football of today, you need to read the game,"" he said. ""You need to understand the opponent and I try really to be focused on that. After that, I'm really comfortable with the ball. You know, I'm not afraid to play.""

650,Australia would not pick convicted rapist Olympian,"Steven van de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 A convicted rapist would not be picked for the Australian Olympics team, says chief Anna Meares after Steven van de Velde was named in the Netherlands beach volleyball squad for Paris 2024. Van de Velde, now 29, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty to raping a 12-year-old British girl when he was 19. The Dutchman, who met his victim on Facebook, travelled from Amsterdam to the UK and raped the girl at an address in Milton Keynes. Van de Velde resumed his volleyball career after serving just 12 months of his four-year sentence and was selected in June for the Dutch Olympic team for Paris. While unwilling to specifically discuss another team's selection, Meares says a convicted rapist would not be selected for Australia. ""If an athlete or staff member had that conviction they would not be allowed to be a member of our team,"" Meares said.  ""We have stringent policies on safeguarding within our team."" Following his initial selection for Paris, the Dutch Olympic Committee (NOC) told BBC Sport: ""After his release, Van de Velde sought and received professional counselling. He demonstrated to those around him - privately and professionally - self-insight and reflection."" The NOC says Van de Velde's return to the sport met guidelines set by the Dutch Volleyball Federation (NeVoBo) in the organisation's ""Guidelines Integrity Record"", which sets out conditions for athletes to resume competing after conviction. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the selection of athletes for the Games was the responsibility of individual committees.  According to Dutch outlet NL Times,, external Van de Velde will not stay in the athletes' village and has instead been provided with alternative accommodation in Paris.

651,James inspires USA to win against Germany in London,"LeBron James is a four-time NBA champion LeBron James scored 20 points for the United States as they beat Germany 92-88 in their final warm-up match before the Olympic Games. The 39-year-old produced 11 points of his game-high tally in the final four minutes as the USA survived a tough test at a sold-out O2 Arena in London. Germany led 71-68 at the end of the third quarter before James inspired the United States to victory.  He sank a three-pointer with one minute 26 seconds remaining to put the USA 90-86 up, then added two more points to give them a 92-86 lead on the way to the win. Joel Embiid scored 15 points and Stephen Curry 13 against Germany in a victory which means the United States have won all five of their pre-Olympic exhibition games. ""It was a good test for us. And I'm glad we were able to once again keep our composure, persevere like we did the other day versus South Sudan,"" said James, who will be a flagbearer for Team USA at Friday's Olympic Games opening ceremony. The USA are targeting a fifth consecutive men's basketball gold medal at this summer's Olympics in Paris, with their 12-man squad filled with some of the NBA's greatest talents. ""Now it's obviously a matter of showing up when the lights are bright next week,"" Curry said. ""I think we're ready. I think we're prepared. Now we have to perform."" They begin their Olympics campaign against Serbia (28 July), before facing South Sudan (31 July) and Puerto Rico (3 August). Sam Harris, BBC Sport Despite winning both exhibition games in London, Team USA have work to do. World champions Germany made a statement by forcing the US into unnecessary turnovers, regaining possession and punishing them for it. This lack of focus will undoubtedly frustrate the coaches, despite some defensive improvements in other coverages seen from the game against South Sudan. But does any of that matter if you have LeBron James on your team? He'll be carrying the US flag on Friday, but against Germany he carried the entire team when needed. At 39, James lit up the O2 Arena, igniting the crowd with an opening dunk that set the tone for the night. Down the stretch, as he did against South Sudan, James took over. Team USA’s final 11 points were all courtesy of the four-time gold medallist, who ended the night with 20 points, six rebounds and four assists. Powering past German defenders to score in the paint and showcasing his finesse with a three-pointer as the clock hit two minutes, the British crowd erupted in applause for 'the King.' James has aged like the finest of wines, growing even more valuable with time.

652,Aston Martin testing hypercar for 2025 Le Mans return,"Aston Martin last won the top class at Le Mans in 1959 Aston Martin have begun testing the new 'hypercar' with which they will return to Le Mans in 2025. The British outfit, whose cars will be overseen by the Heart of Racing works team, join several manufacturers who have returned to the World Endurance Championship following the introduction of the new hypercar class. Two AMR-LMH Valkyries will compete at next year's Le Mans 24 Hours, which was won in 2024 by Ferrari's 499P car for the second year in succession. The last outright win for Aston Martin at Le Mans came in 1959, with 2025 set to mark their first tilt at the top-tier race since 2011. The team will also take one step further than many of the returning manufacturers and run their own factory-made chassis in the IMSA Weathertech Sportscar Championship - the equivalent series in America, which includes the Daytona 24 Hours. Adam Carter, Aston Martin's head of endurance motorsport, said: ""The Valkyrie is a pure, leading edge racing machine, and while it is very early in the testing cycle, we are satisfied that it is achieving the targets."" Sportscar racing has seen a resurgence in popularity and participation with hypercars, with manufacturers able to compete with divergent design philosophies all under a 'balance of performance', which limits the power output of the cars. Competitors can buy in a customer chassis and integrate it with their own power units, or build a fully original factory chassis from scratch. Porsche, Ferrari, Peugeot, General Motors, Lamborghini, Alpine, BMW and other independents have joined the ever-present Toyota in recent years, producing several unpredictable outcomes in races. Aston Martin, who produced the Valkyrie with Heart of Racing at a newly rebuilt facility near Silverstone alongside the Formula 1 team, will run their own chassis with a 6.5-litre V12 Cosworth engine. Several Formula drivers have turned to sportscars, including 2009 champion Jenson Button, who says the cars are ""more technically advanced"" than those in F1. Aston Martin's current driver, two-time champion Fernando Alonso, has won Le Mans twice with Toyota, whilst ex-Aston driver and four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel tested a Porsche hypercar earlier this year.

654,US Secret Service boss resigns over Trump shooting failures,"US Secret Service director Kim Cheatle has resigned after security failures surrounding an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. ""As your director, I take full responsibility for the security lapse,"" Ms Cheatle said in a resignation letter to agency staff on Tuesday.  She had faced calls from both Democrats and Republicans to step down after a contentious House committee hearing on Monday about the incident. Lawmakers became increasingly frustrated when she refused to answer questions about the shooting at Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this month.  In her resignation letter, Ms Cheatle said she had always ""put the needs of the agency first"" and it was “with a heavy heart” that she made her decision.  “The scrutiny over the last week has been intense and will continue to remain as our operational tempo increases,” she said. “I do not want my calls for resignation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you do towards our vital mission.” President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was grateful for her decades of public service.  ""The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again,"" he said.  Mr Biden said he would appoint a new director soon. For now, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has  appointed Ronald Rowe as acting director of the agency.  Mr Rowe, a 24-year Secret Service veteran, has held the position of deputy director since April 2023.  The president appointed Ms Cheatle to head the Secret Service - which oversees the protection of current and former presidents and other officials - in 2022. She had previously served 27 years at the agency in various roles.  During her time as an agent, Ms Cheatle was involved in evacuating then Vice-President Dick Cheney from the White House during the 11 September 2001 attacks. She later went on to become supervisor of Mr Biden’s protective detail when he was vice-president, before she became the deputy assistant director of protective operations. But her leadership came under question after the shooting at Trump's 13 July rally, where a bullet grazed the former president's ear.  The attack left one audience member dead and two others badly wounded.  Lawmakers questioned Ms Cheatle about security preparations ahead of the campaign rally during the tense six-hour House Oversight Committee hearing.  Ms Cheatle took responsibility for the security lapses, but pushed back on calls to resign.  She called the shooting ""the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades"".  Witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man - suspect Thomas Matthew Crooks - with a rifle on a rooftop at the rally minutes before shots were fired.  Crooks was killed by a counter sniper shortly after. Security and law enforcement officers from a number of different agencies were present at the rally.  During her testimony, Ms Cheatle didn't offer lawmakers any new information on how Crooks was able to access the roof where he was perched and why Trump was allowed to take the stage. After the hearing, the leading Republican and Democrat from the committee - James Comer and Jamie Raskin - sent a letter to Ms Cheatle that laid out their belief that she should step down. Mr Comer said Ms Cheatle “instilled no confidence” during the hearing that she can fulfill the Secret Service’s protective mission. “The Oversight Committee’s hearing resulted in Director Cheatle’s resignation and there will be more accountability to come,” he said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. In a post on his social media platform on Tuesday, Trump said: ""The Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy."" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called her resignation “overdue” and said he was ""glad she did the right thing"".  ""Now we have to pick up the pieces, we have to rebuild the American people's faith and trust in the Secret Service,"" he told reporters.  Teresa Wilson, an ex-marine who attended the rally, told the BBC that she was ""glad [Ms Cheatle] succumbed to the pressure"".   ""I hope they still follow through with the independent investigation now that she's resigned. We want answers,"" she said.

664,Walkway collapse kills two on infamous Naples estate,"Two people were killed and 13 others injured when a walkway collapsed on a council estate which has become synonymous with Naples mafia drug wars. Several members of the same family were reportedly getting some fresh air on a sweltering night when the third-floor walkway connecting two sections of a building on the dilapidated Scampia estate crumbled beneath their feet. One of the residents, Vincenza Troise, said she was having dinner “with the door wide open because it was so hot when suddenly we heard a loud roar, like an earthquake”. The victims were named locally as 29-year-old Roberto, a butcher and the father of a two-year-old girl, and his aunt Margherita, 35, who had three children. Of the 13 people hurt, seven were children aged between two and eight years old. Two of the younger children are described as being in a critical condition. More than 800 people were evacuated from the estate overnight.  Several residents told Italian media that they blamed the accident on ongoing building work on the estate. “Every morning you can feel the vibrations from the jackhammers and you see rocks tumbling down,” one woman told state broadcaster Rai. Prosecutors in Naples have opened an investigation for manslaughter. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on X that she was “distressed” by what had happened and offered her condolences to the families of the victims. The Scampia estate to the north of Naples was built in the 1960s, at the height of Italy’s postwar economic boom.  Made up of seven large buildings – dubbed Vele or “sails” for their triangular shape – the complex was inspired by modernist housing developments developed by French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier and was meant to house some of Naples’ fast-growing population. But the green spaces, schools, common areas and playgrounds that were meant to become the pulsating heart of a thriving community never materialised, and public transport connections to Naples were never built.  The area soon turned into a hotspot for organised crime, prostitution and open-air drug-dealing – and Scampia became a symbol of urban decay. The situation worsened still when many families who were left homeless after an earthquake struck the region in 1980 moved into the Scampia buildings illegally, adding to the overcrowding and unsafe conditions. In the early 2000s, the bloody feuds between rival gangs were documented in Roberto Saviano’s book Gomorrah, and a film of the same name was partly shot in Scampia. Many residents tried to shake off the label through grassroots cultural initiatives, community projects or activities aimed at keeping children away from criminal gangs.  But more often it was violent episodes - like the 2012 killing of a mafia boss in a kindergarten playground - that thrust Scampia into the headlines. Italian authorities started tearing down the “Sails” in 1998, although demolition was frequently halted by the discovery of asbestos. A university campus has already been built where one of the “Sails” used to stand, and there are plans for a new kindergarten, cultural centre and park. By the end of this year, only one building – Vela Celeste (Blue Sail), where Monday’s accident took place - is due to remain standing and will be repurposed into offices. The city of Naples said earlier this year that the last “Sail” would stay in place “as a symbol of the past, of this neighbourhood and of the fight for redemption that this community has fought”. The mayor of Naples, Gaetano Manfredi, said he was “profoundly pained by the tragedy” but added that the project to repurpose the “Sails” wouldn’t stop.  “Now is the time to hope for the [injured] children… and it’s for them that I want to repeat that our commitment for Scampia will be stronger than ever.”",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g0pp2pj1o,Unknown,Unknown,
663,"150,000 have fled Gaza's Khan Younis since Monday, UN says","More than 150,000 people have fled the Gazan city of Khan Younis since Monday, two UN agencies have said. Khan Younis, which is situated in the south of the Gaza Strip, has been the focus of a new Israeli military offensive which it says is aimed at combating “efforts by Hamas to reassemble its forces there"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an evacuation order for eastern parts of Khan Younis on Monday. It also reduced the size of the designated al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, which it claimed was being used by Hamas fighters to carry out  ""terrorist activity and rocket fire"".  At least 80 Palestinians have been killed in the area since the Israeli operation began, according to figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. An official from UNRWA - the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees - told the BBC’s Today programme that an estimated 150,000 people had fled Khan Younis since Monday, when the latest evacuation order was announced. ""Over 80% of the Gaza Strip has been placed under evacuation orders or designated as no-go zones by the Israeli military,"" Louise Wateridge said.  On Tuesday, tanks were seen pushing deep into the Bani Suhaila district, with operations also taking place in the area of Al-Qarara. Some residents attempted to flee to displacement camps in the eastern parts of Khan Younis, whilst others crammed into hospitals to seek refuge. Rabah Abdul Ghafour, 37, a resident of Bani Suhaila, took shelter at Nasser Hospital. “I have been displaced 12 times since 7 October,” he told the BBC. “We lived the hardest night of our lives. The sound of explosions and gunfire did not stop for a moment. It was as if the war had started yesterday.” Rawan Al-Brim, 22, from Al-Qarara, arrived at Nasser Hospital with her husband and mother-in-law on Monday.  “We slept in the outer yard without a mattress or a blanket. My four-month-old daughter was born during the war. My breast milk has dried up and I can’t find any milk to satisfy her hunger. My baby screams from hunger all night,” she said. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it also assessed that 150,000 people had fled Khan Younis by monitoring population movements on the ground. It said that many people were “trapped in the evacuation area,” including “people with reduced mobility and family members supporting them.” “We’re seeing people moving to Deir al-Balah and western Khan Younis. Both of these areas are already extremely overcrowded,” Ms Wateridge told the BBC. “They’ve got limited shelters and limited services available. They can barely accommodate the people who are already in these areas.” In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating ""in the Khan Younis area over the past 24 hours"" and had “eliminated several terrorists” whilst “dismantling terrorist infrastructure”. Israel’s offensive comes as The World Health Organization said it was “extremely worried” about the possibility of an outbreak of the highly infectious polio virus in Gaza after traces were found in wastewater. Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ejjdk4r7o,Unknown,Unknown,
662,"UK must be ready to fight war in three years, says Army head","Britain must be ready to fight a war in three years, the new head of the Army has said. Gen Sir Roland Walker has warned against a range of threats in what he called an ""increasingly volatile"" world.  But he said war was not inevitable and the Army had ""just enough time"" to prepare itself to avoid conflict.  Central to this was doubling the Army's fighting power by 2027 and tripling it by the end of the decade, he said. In his first speech in the role on Tuesday, Gen Walker said the UK faced danger from an ""axis of upheaval"".  Among the key threats facing the UK in the coming years, highlighted by the general in a briefing, is an angered Russia, which could seek retribution against the West for supporting Ukraine, regardless of who wins the war. He said: “It doesn’t matter how it ends. I think Russia will emerge from it probably weaker objectively – or absolutely – but still very, very dangerous and wanting some form of retribution for what we have done to help Ukraine."" He also warned that China was intent on retaking Taiwan, and Iran was likely to pursue nuclear weapons.  He said the threats they posed could become particularly acute within the next three years, and that since the war in Ukraine these countries had created a ""mutual transactional relationship"", sharing weapons and technology. But he said the path to war was not ""inexorable"" if the UK re-established credible land forces to support its strategy of deterrence to avoid war. He did not directly appeal for further funding or troops in his speech, describing his force of just over 70,000 regular troops as a ""medium-sized army"".  But he urged the British Army to modernise quickly - including focusing on technology like Artificial Intelligence and firepower, rather than numbers. Eventually, his ambition is for the Army to be able to destroy an enemy three times its own size.  This would mean firing faster and further, he said, helped by learning the lessons from the war in Ukraine.  The general's speech comes one week after the government launched a ""root and branch"" defence review to ""take a fresh look"" at the challenges facing the armed forces. Launching the review, Defence Secretary John Healey described the current state of the armed forces as ""hollowed-out"" and said ""procurement waste and neglected morale cannot continue"". There are 75,325 members of the UK’s regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latest Ministry of Defence (MoD) figures from April 2024. That figure has been falling in recent years as recruitment has failed to match retention. The previous Conservative government reduced its target headcount from 82,000 to 72,500 by 2025. Members of the Nato military alliance have pledged to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence per year by 2024, though several nations are not likely to meet this target. The UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said the defence review would set out a “roadmap” to the goal of increasing this to 2.5%, but he is yet to put a timeline on this commitment.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c035d05je2jo,Unknown,Unknown,
661,Delta faces probe as CrowdStrike disruption lingers,"The US has opened an investigation into Delta Airlines as it struggles to recover from last week's global IT outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Delta must provide passengers with refunds and other compensation for disrupted travel as required by law.  A day earlier, Delta, which has cancelled more than 5,000 flights since Friday,  signalled it could take several more days for operations to return to normal.  Meanwhile, CrowdStrike's boss George Kurtz, whose cybersecurity firm sparked the chaos with a faulty overnight update, has also been called to testify in Congress. The House Committee for Homeland Security said in a letter: ""While we appreciate CrowdStrike’s response and coordination with stakeholders, we cannot ignore the magnitude of this incident. It added: ""Recognising that Americans will undoubtedly feel the lasting, real-world consequences of this incident, they deserve to know in detail how this incident happened and the mitigation steps CrowdStrike is taking.” CrowdStrike said it was working on ways to make it easier and faster to fix the issue, which downed an estimated 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices globally, hitting airlines, health systems and other services.  In many cases, IT teams had to reboot computers manually. Delta, which appears to have had more difficulty recovering than other airlines, said that its crew-staffing system had been affected by the incident.  As of Tuesday morning, it had already cancelled more than 400 flights and delayed hundreds of others, following more than 1,150 cancellations a day earlier, according to tracking firm Flight Aware.  Delta said it was focused on restoring operating and ""fully cooperating"" with the Department of Transportation's investigation.  ""Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta,” the company said.   But the incident has raised pressure on the company.  In announcing the investigation, Mr Buttigieg said: ""All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld."" ""While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with [the transport department's] enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up,"" he wrote on social media. Senator Maria Cantwell, who leads the Senate commerce committee, also sent a letter to the company, noting that it had been ""far slower"" than other airlines to recover. She faulted the firm for inaccurately describing passenger rights to refunds on its website and noted its responsibility to ensure live customer service agents are available to assist customers.   ""While the technology outage was clearly not caused by Delta or any airline, I am nevertheless concerned that Delta is failing to meet the moment and adequately protect the needs of passengers,"" she wrote.  The Biden administration in April finalised a rule requiring that airlines promptly and automatically refund passengers for significant changes to their travel, and other issues. It was part of a broader effort to step up policing of airlines after a series of major travel meltdowns.  Last year, Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $140m (£108m) resolve a Department of Transportation investigation launched after a storm disrupted service and set off a cascade of cancellations during the busy 2022 holiday travel period.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gdlm4079ro,Unknown,Unknown,
660,Keanu Reeves: I think about death all the time,"Many of us avoid thinking about death, but not Keanu Reeves. ""I'm 59, so I'm thinking about death all the time,"" the Hollywood megastar has revealed to BBC News. That's a good thing, he adds. ""Hopefully it's not crippling, but hopefully it's sensitised [us] to an appreciation of the breath we have, and the relationships that we have the potential to have."" The reason we're sitting with The Matrix star, ruminating on life and mortality, is not because he has another blockbuster to promote. This time, it's a new book - Reeves' first novel. The Book of Elsewhere, written in collaboration with British science fiction author China Miéville, follows an immortal warrior, who wants to be able to die. We meet Reeves and Miéville in a lowly lit hotel bar in central London. The Canadian actor, who is based in Hollywood, makes time to see us in between gigs with his Dogstar band. The night before, the band played in Manchester. Reeves looks a bit tired as we begin the 30 minute interview. But his passion for his novel also comes through strongly. The Book of Elsewhere is based on the hugely successful BRZRKR comic book series created by Reeves. Released in 2021, BRZRKR - pronounced ""berserker"" for the uninitiated - is also due to be adapted into a live-action Netflix film starring Reeves, as well as an anime series. For Reeves, comic books have a special appeal. ""I love the images,"" he said. ""I love words and storytelling and I love the way that you can have this engagement that overlays. And so you can look at the art and then you can follow the story."" The actor plays down his role in the collaborative process though, insisting: ""I didn't write a novel. China wrote a novel."" Miéville argues ""that's putting it too far,"" adding: ""It wouldn't exist in the form without a lot of very thoughtful and careful work with Keanu."" The central character in the plot is known only as ""B"". With his long dark hair, B shares physical similarities with Reeves. And when the comic book first came out, some fans also pointed out certain thematic similarities between the two, including a difficult personal life. Reeves has lost several people he has loved in his life, including his girlfriend, their stillborn daughter and his best friend. But that might be where the similarities end. B is 80,000 years old, half-mortal and half-god. He also has a ""curse of violence"", which seems completely unlike Reeves. The actor, who is known for his gentle, mild-mannered persona, has often been described as the nicest man in Hollywood. B, on the other hand, is someone who can ""punch through people's chests and rip their arms off, rip their heads off"", according to Reeves. So where does such violence come from? ""I think it was influenced by some of the action films that I had done,"" said Reeves, who has also starred in the Speed and John Wick franchises. Reviews of the comic book were broadly positive when it came out, so Reeves and Miéville will be hoping to replicate that success. In Flickering Myth, Calum Petrie awarded it seven out of 10 stars, writing that it was ""enjoyable"" but also ""a bit more on the gory side than I am used to in a lot of comics"". It was given 9.5 stars by Justin Harrison in AIPT Comics, who praised it as ""excellent"" and ""intriguing"" while also cautioning readers about the violence it depicts. There's no doubt that this book is violent. In its opening pages, it describes a shooting, followed by ""the tough bloody business of the clean-up"". We asked Reeves about the much debated link between violence on-screen and in books, and in the real world. Momentarily, he appears defensive. ""I hope if they read BRZRKR, that they don't go out and start ripping people's arms off and chopping their heads off,"" he said. ""Because there's also a love story in it. But if you do read it, I hope maybe you can find love if you don't have it."" Miéville also pushed back against there being a connection between depicted violence and real violence. ""I get quite irritated about how this question is posed,"" he said. ""It's so clearly a kind of cultural scapegoating,"" he added. ""I think the idea of looking at video games and movies and so on, it's just a way of exonerating the people who are really profiting from the violence."" Having created a whole fantasy world, you wonder whether Reeves is trying to escape from reality. ""Maybe ultimately the fantasy of building another world brings some kind of comfort in some way,"" he admits. ""There's something ultimately about the creative gesture that comes from pain,"" he added. ""Creating stuff is great. Just creating, sharing, and hopefully people like the stories that we tell."" And if they do - if the book is a success - what will Reeves do with the proceeds of the book? The actor is famed for his generosity, and a lot has been written about how he reportedly doesn't like owning things. But this, too, is something Reeves appears to push back on, as our interview comes to a close. ""I love owning things, I love having stuff,"" he said. ""I'm certainly not going to present myself as someone who gives everything away."" The Book of Elsewhere is published on 23 July by Penguin.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl7y05lr475o,Unknown,Unknown,
665,How retired Australian striker earned Olympic comeback,"Five years ago, Australian striker Michelle Heyman retired from international football with a little more than a whimper. But on Thursday, the 36-year-old will walk onto the field with the Matildas as they open their Olympic campaign, a feat being called one of the greatest comebacks in Australian sport. After a record-breaking performance in the domestic football league this season, where she became the first A-League Women (ALW) player to ever surpass 100 goals, Heyman caught the eye of a Matildas coach desperate to fill the hole left by an injured Sam Kerr. But not only is Heyman back in the squad, she is being seen as Australia’s best shot at finding the net in France. ""There’s always some haters thinking I'm too old to be back,"" she told the BBC before the tournament. ""But it's kind of fun to prove points to people... age is just a number."" Much like her return to the team in 2024, it was a stellar performance in the A-League – Australia’s domestic football offering – which catapulted a 21-year-old Heyman into the national team back in 2010. Heyman would go on to play 61 games and score 20 goals for the Matildas, including appearances at the 2015 World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics, but her early international career was marred by constant struggle. The Matildas of that era were paid miserably and worked under constant fear and stress, a team culture allegedly so toxic it resulted in the sacking of coach Alen Stajcic in early 2019. But if there was little support from officials, there was even less from the public. Many of the Matildas games weren’t even open to spectators – the cost would outweigh ticket sales. And then there were Heyman’s battles with both her physical and mental health: in interviews she spoke about anxiety and regular panic attacks, then back-to-back ankle and knee injuries which only made them worse. By May 2019, Heyman was burnt out, injured and stressed. Her starting position on the team was long gone and she hadn’t played even a minute in six months. ""I really wanted to fight [on]… but my body isn't going to allow me to do that. My mind isn't going to allow me to do that,"" Heyman told Fox Sports when announcing her retirement from international football. She’d achieved everything she set out to, except an Olympic gold medal, she said. Years later she would admit she was trying to save face, telling Australian media she was actually dropped from the team. ""I had to just pretend that I wanted to retire but it was mainly because I got fired,"" she told Code Sports. Heyman was so shattered she also exited the A-League and it seemed like the final pages of her storied career had been written. But just 18 months later, a recharged Heyman returned to the A-League in a blaze of glory, netting a hat-trick in her first match back for Canberra United. ""I missed being part of something bigger than myself,"" she said at the time. Since then, she has overtaken Kerr as the leading ALW goal scorer and become the first to earn a third Golden Boot award. These achievements, combined with her two Julie Dolan medals - the competition’s highest honour - arguably make her the league’s most decorated player. So when Olympic selection came around, Heyman was ready and waiting, at the top of her game. ""She's in tremendous form, she's scoring for fun,"" head coach Tony Gustavsson said in February when recalling her to the squad. The announcement quickly made waves around the country. ""Just quietly, this might be one of Australian sport’s greatest comeback stories in recent memory,"" wrote Sydney Morning Herald football journalist Vince Rugari.  ""Was it something that I thought would ever happen again? Probably not,"" Heyman says with a smile. ""I still remember the day - just like, tears. And I don't cry!” Adding to the emotion is the fact the country she’s playing for barely resembles the one she competed for just five years ago. The Matildas are the hottest sporting team in Australia, more well liked and well known than even the Australian men’s cricket team, experts say. Players are now household names, every match on home soil since the start of the World Cup has sold out and they hold the record for the most watched television event in Australian history. It’s hard to reconcile that with Heyman’s debut on ""a back field in Queensland somewhere"". ""I reckon there was 12 people at the game, if we were lucky,"" she says. ""And then now you look at it and our last game, 77,000 people [have] come, cheering you on. That's the feeling that I wanted for so many years, and it's something that I never thought was ever going to happen in Australia."" That awe and a bittersweet joy has rippled through the previous ranks of Matildas too, she says. ""I bring that emotion from every other ex-player, and I want to do it for them. I want to show them 'look what we all created'."" Does that – and the spectre of Kerr, the nation’s biggest sporting idol – add to the pressure to perform in France? Heyman answers with a confident no. She and Kerr are ""very different"" forwards but can both deliver, she says. In her few months back in the team, she has already scored six goals, twice as many as any of her teammates over the same period. ""I don't think anyone remembers the other, numerous amounts of goals I've scored for Australia, because they were done back in the day when no one cared about them,” she says with a chuckle. ""[But] I'm good at my job, and I'll continue to work hard and to win games."" Hard work will certainly be required. The Matildas have drawn a difficult group – going up against the powerhouse USA team, Rio 2016 gold medallists Germany, and Zambia for the two guaranteed spots in the next round. The team has also suffered a slew of injuries. Apart from Kerr, co-captain Steph Catley and key winger Caitlin Foord have both been under a cloud the past month. And midfielder Katrina Gorry and defender Clare Hunt have only just returned from injury. And though their World Cup campaign - most of which Kerr spent on the bench – would argue otherwise, pundits say the team often struggles to perform without her. So what does Heyman say to the people who have already written the Matildas off? ""They can be quiet,"" she says cheekily. ""The more people we have supporting us the better we're going to do. ""And we're doing it for you - we're playing to win for our country.""",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clmy2yppmmjo,Unknown,Unknown,
658,"Netanyahu facing 'day of rage' in Washington, protesters say","Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters will descend on Washington for a ""day of rage"" over the war in Gaza as Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks in Congress on Wednesday, organisers have warned. The message comes after Mr Netanyahu said he would ""present the truth about our just war"", during his first trip outside Israel since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. Ahmad Abuznaid, executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights and a chief organiser, said protesters would ""make the statement that war criminals like Netanyahu are not welcome"" in the United States. Mr Netanyahu was invited by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to give his first address to Congress in nine years. Mr Johnson has warned against protests inside the House chamber, saying there would be arrests ""if we have to do it"". But organisers say the streets will be filled with furious demonstrations. Reem Assil, a member of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, said she was travelling from California to protest against the the deaths of family members and other civilians in the ""mass slaughter"" in Gaza. ""The idea of the man responsible for these atrocities being allowed to come here, channels my rage,"" she said. ""I've lost over 40 members of my family and work through grief every day to remain committed to showing up for my people. This is a huge moment."" The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas invaded Israel on 7 October last year, killed approximately 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 Israelis and foreigners.  The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 39,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the Israeli response. Israel denies accusations of war crimes.  Mr Netanyahu is also due to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Jinan Deena, a Palestinian-American from the Washington area, said she and others were ""gearing up for a day of rage"" against Mr Netanyahu's visit. ""To know [Mr Netanyahu] is going to be sharing air with us in our own city... it's like a slap in the face,"" she said. Another organiser from Michigan, who did not give their name, said ""more people are willing to get arrested this time"" compared to previous protests. More than 300 pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested for wrongfully gathering inside and outside of the US Capitol complex in October. An estimated 400,000 gathered in Washington to protest against the war in January. ""All the protests have shown a tone of rage, but this time is definitely different,"" Ayah, an organiser with the Palestinian Youth Movement, told the BBC. ""It is our enemy, our primary enemy, they are inviting into the White House."" Mr Netanyahu faces both international and domestic pressure for his handling of the war. His US trip also follows a ruling by the International Court of Justice that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories was ""illegal"". Israel rejects the ruling. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in May applied for arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu, as well as senior Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed al-Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, alleging war crimes on both sides. Mr Netanyahu condemned the application as ""a complete distortion of reality"" that equated Israel to the ""mass murderers of Hamas"". Hamas, meanwhile, accused the prosecutor of trying to ""equate the victim with the executioner"". Polling by Israel's Channel 12 says that 72% of Israelis think Mr Netanyahu should resign over security lapses on 7 October and the failure to free hostages that still remain in the hands of Hamas.  Mr Netanyahu will also face protests in the US from Israelis. Maya Roman, whose cousin spent 54 days in captivity after being kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, is among those travelling from Israel. She told the BBC that Mr Netanyahu was ""leaving behind"" hostages still in captivity, and ignoring the more pressing issue of a ceasefire deal that would free them. ""By leaving without a signed deal, he makes the hostages and the families feel abandoned,"" she said. Pro-Israel protesters will also be in Washington. Ira Stoll, a Jewish-American who has family in Israel, said he was happy Mr Netanyahu was coming. ""America needs to show it stand with its friends, and Netanyahu is the elected leader of one of our friends,"" Mr Stoll, who is not coming, said.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978m115eg8o,Unknown,Unknown,
657,Video shows Illinois police fatally shoot woman in her home,"Illinois police have released bodycam footage showing the chaotic moments that led to the fatal shooting of a woman who had called 911 to report a suspected intruder at her home. The killing of Sonya Massey, 36, over Independence Day weekend has led to criminal charges against the officer who opened fire, and drawn condemnation from the White House.  Sangamon County Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson has been sacked from the police force and charged with murder and official misconduct.  He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. As of Monday, he was being held without bond.  Daniel Fultz, a lawyer representing Mr Grayson, declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. On Monday, Illinois State Police released bodycam footage that shows the officers shouting at Ms Massey to put down a pot of boiling water as they point their pistols at her. The incident in the early hours of 6 July began when Ms Massey called police to her home in Springfield, 200 miles (320km) south of Chicago, to report that she believed someone had broken into her property. Officers followed her inside when Ms Massey entered her home, and watched as she searched for her identification. In the video, Mr Grayson sees a pot sitting on a lit stove, gestures towards it and says: ""We don't need a fire while we're here."" Ms Massey walks to the stove to remove the cooking utensil. She and Mr Grayson appear to laugh over her pot of ""steaming hot water"", before she twice says: ""I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.""  ""You better [expletive] not or I swear to God I'll [expletive] shoot you in your [expletive] face,"" Mr Grayson says. He then draws his pistol as he shouts for her to drop the pot.  ""OK, I'm sorry,"" Ms Massey is heard saying before she ducks.  After shooting her, the officer says: ""What else do we do? I’m not taking hot [expletive] boiling water to the [expletive] face."" The video also records Mr Grayson telling his police partner that she would not need medical help.  As the other deputy tries to get a medical kit, the officer says: ""She's done. You can go get it, but that's a head shot.""  Mr Grayson then leaves to get his own medical kit, after the other officer says that they can at least try to stop Ms Massey's bleeding.  On Monday, the Sangamon County State’s Attorney’s Office said Mr Grayson was not justified in his use of force.  In a statement, President Biden said he was ""heartbroken"" for her family and that her death was a reminder ""that all too often Black Americans face fears for their safety in ways many of the rest of us do not"". Vice-President Kamala Harris called on Congress to pass police reforms, posting on X: ""Sonya Massey deserved to be safe. ""The disturbing footage released yesterday confirms what we know from the lived experiences of so many - we have much work to do to ensure that our justice system fully lives up to its name."" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul called the footage of the shooting ""horrific"" in a statement on Monday.  “As the community reacts to the release of the footage, I urge calm as this matter works its way through the criminal justice system,"" Mr Raoul said.  Attorneys for Ms Massey's family have commended prosecutors for their swift action against Mr Grayson.  Personal injury lawyer Benjamin Crump said the footage would ""shock the conscience of America"". ",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c28evrd9depo,Unknown,Unknown,
656,Rescuers hail 'miracle' survival of hiker lost for weeks,"Rescuers in Kentucky are marvelling at the ""miracle"" survival of a hiker who was missing for two weeks in a remote complex of canyons in the scenic Red River Gorge. Scott Hern, 46, was located alive by the Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team on what was going to be the last day of their search mission. Officials say they are amazed that he was able to survive, despite having no food for 12 days. In a Facebook post on Monday, rescuer Eric Wolterman described how he and Mr Hern shared an emotional hug on Saturday. ""It was going to be the final day of searching whether we located anything or not,"" he wrote in his post. Mr Wolterman's team spent hours bushwhacking, he wrote, calling the treacherous landscape ""the roughest terrain you could imagine"". He said the team found footprints in the mud and stopped to regroup.  They heard a ""very faint noise"" and after calling out, heard someone say ""help"". Mr Wolterman described running after Mr Hern told the group his name, writing: ""I have never moved faster up hill in my entire life."" After telling Mr Hern that he was safe, the lost hiker asked for a hug. ""I got teary eyed, and gave him a big hug. I think it was the best hug of both of our lives,"" he wrote. Mr Hern had last been seen on 6 July. Family members said he had planned to explore the region's waterfalls. He was taken by helicopter to hospital after his rescue, and is currently recovering. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear praised rescuers in a statement, saying their work led to ""a remarkable outcome"". ""Thank you to the Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team and everyone who assisted in rescue efforts,"" he said. The lush Red River Gorge Geological Area in eastern Kentucky is known for steep cliffs and rock formations that are popular with rock climbers.

655,Kamala Harris slams Trump at first rally as he hits back,"US Vice-President Kamala Harris has gone on the offensive against Donald Trump in the first rally of her White House campaign, portraying November’s election as one between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon. Speaking to a crowd of thousands in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Ms Harris likened her Republican opponent to fraudsters she said she had prosecuted. Trump, meanwhile, assailed her work on the border, and posted on social media: “Lyin’ Kamala Harris destroys everything she touches!” It comes a day after she secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates, paving the way for her to become the party's nominee. On Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race and endorsed his vice-president amid mounting pressure from top Democrats and donors following his disastrous debate against Trump in late June. The fledgling Harris campaign raised a staggering $100m plus (£77m) in the 36 hours after Mr Biden’s exit. Adding to her momentum, a new national poll from Reuters and Ipsos shows her with a two-point lead over Trump, 44% to 42%. Taking the stage to applause at a high school in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Ms Harris highlighted her experience as California's attorney general. ""I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” she said. “Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.” ""So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type,"" Ms Harris added. ""In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week."" In response, the crowd shouted ""Kamala! Kamala!"" Some observers noted that the audience's enthusiasm contrasted with that seen at Biden events this electoral cycle. Trump, meanwhile, posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, about a poll finding that Ms Harris was the most unpopular vice-president in US history. He also shared a post noting that she was rated by the non-partisan congressional scorekeeper GovTrack as one of the most left-wing among dozens of Democratic senators during her tenure. Ms Harris laid out a number of policy priorities in her speech, including tackling child poverty, union rights, affordable healthcare and being able to ""retire with dignity"". She also focused on gun control and abortion access, vowing to stop Trump's ""extreme abortion bans, because we must trust women to make decisions about their own body”. The Republican party platform, approved by Trump, does not advocate for any abortion restrictions at the federal level, instead leaving the matter up to individual US states to decide. The Trump campaign is focusing on Ms Harris' ""failure"" to stem a record influx of illegal immigrants at the US-Mexico border. A Tuesday afternoon email from the Republican nominee’s team accused her of bailing out ""accused murderers, rapists and other violent offenders"", insulting Israel and deceiving the US public about Mr Biden's ""cognitive decline"". During a call with reporters, Trump said of Ms Harris: ""She's a radical left person, but this country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it. ""I think she should be easier than Biden, because he was slightly more mainstream, but not much."" Trump also said he was open to debating her in September, when he was originally due to face Biden on ABC News. ""I haven't agreed to anything,” he said. “I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden. But I want to debate her. She'll be no different."" In Washington, a Republican member of the US House of Representatives introduced articles of impeachment against Ms Harris. The resolution, written by Tennessee's Andy Ogles, accuses her of high crimes and misdemeanours over her handling of immigration at the border. It is considered unlikely to advance.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn053pnv0k1o,Unknown,Unknown,
659,Senator Bob Menendez to quit after bribery conviction,"Bob Menendez is to resign from the US Senate after being convicted of accepting bribes including gold bars to help foreign governments. The New Jersey Democrat had been resisting calls to step down, including from Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer. His resignation comes a day after the Senate's ethics committee began a review on his expulsion. The former head of the Senate foreign relations committee was found guilty on 16 counts of taking bribes to aid the Qatari and Egyptian governments, and faces a lengthy prison term when he is sentenced on 29 October. Jurors were told that FBI agents discovered more than $480,000 (£370,452) in cash stuffed in envelopes and coats in Menendez's home, along with gold bars worth more than $100,000. Some of the bullion was presented as evidence. The 70-year-old maintains his innocence, saying after his conviction that he ""never violated my public oath"".  In his resignation letter to Phil Murphy, New Jersey's governor, Menendez said he was proud of his accomplishments in the Senate and that while he intended to appeal his conviction, ""I do not want the Senate to be involved in a lengthy process that will detract from its important work"". The resignation notice, effective on August 20, was also read on the Senate floor.  Menendez was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1993. He was later appointed to the Senate in 2006 by John Corzine, who resigned his seat after being elected governor of New Jersey.  A previous bribery and conspiracy charges ended in a mistrial in 2017. However, a nine-trial this year ended in a guilty verdict. Two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are also being tried on accusations that they sought out the senator to illegally aid the Egyptian government and secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund. They deny the charges. A third businessman, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and gave evidence against Menendez in the trial. New Jersey Representative Andy Kim won the Democratic nomination to run for Senate in June, beating Tammy Murphy, the wife of New Jersey's governor.  The New York Times reported that Menendez could theoretically run for re-election as an independent, potentially siphoning votes from the Democrats at a time when the party is heavily focused on maintaining the Senate and White House.  A trial against his wife on bribery and obstruction charges has been postponed indefinitely while she recovers from breast cancer surgery.",2024-07-23 23:11:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gjn8le2ro,Unknown,Unknown,
666,Sharks off Brazil coast test positive for cocaine,"Sharks off the coast of Brazil have tested positive for cocaine, scientists say. Marine biologists tested 13 Brazilian sharpnose sharks taken from the shores near Rio de Janeiro and found they tested for high levels of cocaine in their muscles and livers. The concentrations were as much as 100 times higher than previously reported for other aquatic creatures. The research, carried out by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, is the first to find the presence of cocaine in sharks.  Experts believe the cocaine is making its way into the waters via illegal labs where the drug is manufactured or through excrement of drug users. Packs of cocaine lost or dumped by traffickers at sea could also be a source, though this is less likely, researchers say. Sara Novais, a marine eco-toxicologist at the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre of the Polytechnic University of Leiria, told Science magazine that the findings are “very important and potentially worrying"". All females in the study were pregnant, but the consequences of cocaine exposure for the foetuses are unknown, experts say. Further research is required to ascertain whether cocaine is changing the behaviour of the sharks. However, previous research has shown that drugs were likely to have similar effects on animals as they do on humans. Last year, chemical compounds including benzoylecgonine, which is produced by the liver after cocaine use, were found in seawater samples collected off the south coast of England.",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cek9mr43x1xo,Unknown,Unknown,
667,"Cows, dairy workers, and America's struggle to track bird flu","For the past 12 years, Freddy Morales has spent most of his time in close proximity to America’s dairy cows, working on several of the country’s thousands of dairy farms. Despite having a job that requires coming into close contact with the animals and regularly sticking medicine down their throats, Mr Morales had not heard of the bird flu virus spreading among US cattle and sickening some dairy workers until very recently. “I don’t have the immune system I used to have,” the 37-year-old told the BBC through a Spanish translator. “Hearing about this, it’s definitely worrisome.” The disease has found a new foothold in the US by infecting dairy cows and at least 10 people in recent months.  Since April, four dairy workers have tested positive for bird flu, or H5N1, in an outbreak that has been connected to dairy herds in 13 states. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that another six poultry workers in Colorado tested positive - and the agency is testing a possible seventh case on Tuesday.  US offiicials have said the strain that infected the poultry workers is closely related to the one infecting cattle and dairy workers, raising concerns about a growing number of infections. So far, the farm workers' cases have been fairly mild and there have been no documented instances of human-to-human transmission.  But scientists, advocates, and farm workers worry that the recent cases could indicate that infection numbers are larger than known among the country's 2.6 million farm workers, as the virus has been detected in 161 livestock herds and millions of chickens and turkeys despite testing not always being extensive.  With the US’s current patchwork monitoring effort that differs state to state, experts said the virus could have more opportunities to mutate into a more severe disease because some areas of the country that have limited testing would not be aware of its presence. They stressed the need for more preventative measures, testing, and information sharing to keep bird flu from spreading undetected.  Anthony Maresso, a Baylor College of Medicine professor tracking bird flu in Texas wastewater, reiterated the CDC caution that the likelihood of the virus spreading among the general public is “still pretty low”. He warned, however, that health officials need to remain vigilant as this bird flu variety could be the “tip of the iceberg”. “What we don’t want to see is the virus evolve to be able to readily infect humans and then transmit amongst us in a way that would cause a global flu pandemic,” he said. But Rick Naerebout, the chief executive officer of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, said that farm owners and workers - many of whom are undocumented - are reluctant to allow the government to conduct tests because they fear the agencies may not keep the data confidential. “There’s not a level of trust there to provide that information,” Mr Naerebout said. “That has been a significant downfall of being able to get testing and being able to get data.” Bird flu has affected nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys - meaning they either died or were culled to prevent further transmission - since it started to spread among American poultry flocks in January 2022, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported. But US dairy farmers were caught by surprise in March when the virus began to infect cattle for the first time, with the first documented case in Texas. It has since spread to dairy herds in states throughout the country. Unlike birds, cows with the virus appear to typically suffer more mild symptoms, like fatigue and decreased milk production. As of now, human symptoms among the four dairy and six poultry workers have also remained fairly minor. They reported issues like conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and some suffered respiratory symptoms more typical of a flu infection. Mr Maresso and his team at Baylor University have continued to detect the virus in wastewater in 10 Texas cities, suggesting there may be a greater number of bird flu infections than known, however. “It does raise a little bit of a concern that it's quite prevalent in a lot of different animals, both those that are wild and domesticated, and it’s now interacting at a much more intimate level with our own species,” said Mr Maresso. The Texas Association of Dairymen, a state dairy industry advocate, has claimed the bird flu had “largely ceased to be an issue in Texas”, and the Texas Department of State Health Services told the BBC that the outbreak among cattle had much improved since March. But the USDA reported an outbreak in a Texas herd as recently as 8 July, and the state’s health department had previously told Stat News that dairy industry groups had blocked their efforts to better document infection rates by keeping experts from visiting farms. The farm agency reported that Colorado and Minnesota have the most recent cases of livestock herd infections, with the virus being detected as recently as 19 July. Unlike during the early days of the pandemic, the availability of tests is not an impediment to monitoring bird flu’s spread, Demetre Daskalakis, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said. Mr Daskalakis told the BBC the government has 150,000 tests available and is expecting one million more tests “in the near future”. The main challenge now is to get farms to agree to the testing of their livestock and their workers. Worker groups, and employees like Mr Morales, say that farm workers have been told very little about testing, are discouraged from taking sick days and have not been offered personal protective equipment that public health experts say could help guard against the bird flu. “If we were told to use it and it was explained why, I think workers would use it,” Mr Morales said of the protective gear. Another problem is that many farm workers in the US are undocumented and not offered paid sick days, which keeps them from getting tested or staying home when ill, said Elizabeth Strater, the director of strategic campaigns for the United Farm Workers, an agricultural workers' rights group. The CDC is offering $75 for farm workers to get tested for bird flu, but that’s not enough to cover costs or lost wages if they have to take a sick day, Ms Strater said. Another challenge for bird flu monitoring are the economic realities of US agriculture and the growing number of financial strains that have particularly affected dairy farms. American dairy farmers have struggled more than most in US agriculture, causing the number of the country’s dairy farms to decline rapidly over the past 50 years. The country boasted 650,000 farms in 1970, according to USDA data, but only 32,000 remained in 2020. With tighter margins, many farmers view any additional financial hardship - which  the bird flu could bring - as an existential threat. Mr Naerebout of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association said that this makes it difficult for farmers to trust government agencies. He said many are choosing to handle outbreaks on their own, without consulting health or other government agencies. “Out of concern for privacy and out of concern for their ongoing business, they manage through it, get to the other side and keep doing their thing,” Mr Naerebout said. Dr Daskalakis said the CDC is focused on building “trust in the farm owners as well as trust in workers” to ensure they feel comfortable connecting with local health agencies. But, he added, “that, in general, is a really hard nut to crack”. Eric Deeble, a USDA official, told reporters last month that the agency is working on programmes that it anticipated would lead to a “surge” in the number of farms participating in a variety of USDA bird flu support programmes. The USDA also told the BBC in a statement that it intends to pay farmers “90 percent of lost production per cow” due to bird flu infections for “a set period of time”. But Mr Neurebout said that few farmers believe that the USDA could sufficiently reimburse dairy - especially as herd sizes in the US have spiked. “For our larger Western herds, you’re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars,” he said. While several states face roadblocks to increasing monitoring efforts, some states have found success by building trust within farm communities. Michigan has received much praise for its work to connect public health officials with dairy farms, which has led to increased testing rates. It is also participating in a CDC study to assess infection risk for dairy workers and the potential for there to be asymptomatic cases. The state does have a high number of bird flu cases - which includes two dairy workers - but scientists and public health officials argue that this corresponds to the effort they have put in to monitor the virus’s spread. Michigan’s chief medical executive Natasha Bagdasarian told the BBC there is time now to stop bird flu in a way they could not with Covid-19, which spread rapidly and proved highly fatal before vaccines were available. “We now have the opportunity to intervene quickly, to prevent a virus from gaining traction within human populations and prevent human-to-human transmission,” she said. Dr Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, acknowledged that the chance of human-to-human transmission remained low. He argued, however, that leaving the situation unaddressed comes with “high potential risk”. “The only way you can long-term control this is to detect it,” he said. “We really don't know with summer coming on, with state fairs going on, with animals being moved around, that this isn't going to get worse before it gets better, unless we can control it.”",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce98zmpq467o,Unknown,Unknown,
668,Has Kamala Harris got what it takes to beat Trump?,"The path for Vice-President Kamala Harris to secure the Democratic presidential nomination is clearing. That may end up being the easy part. The most formidable challenge – defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November – is still to come. Her elevation to the top of ticket would bring new strengths for the Democrats, but it also exposes weaknesses that were less of a concern with Mr Biden. According to recent polls, Ms Harris trails the former president slightly – a roughly similar position to the one Mr Biden found himself in before his historic announcement. But there may be more room for those numbers to shift as we move from a hypothetical matchup to a very real one. For at least a moment, Democrats have a jolt of energy after more than three weeks of intense hand-wringing over the president’s fitness and ability to sustain his campaign.  All of Ms Harris’s leading potential rivals for the nomination have endorsed her, as has former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi – who remains one of the most influential players in Democratic politics. This is, still, shaping up to be a tight race in November - a condition that reflects deep partisan trenches in American politics and the distaste many voters have for Trump as a candidate.  The vice-president’s primary challenge – and opportunity - will be to capitalise on this Trump aversion, attract centrist voters in key swing states and energise the Democratic base, which was in the past few weeks swinging towards despair, to match the enthusiasm many on the right hold for the former president. This renewed sense of Democratic presidential enthusiasm comes with a dollar sign attached. According to the Harris campaign, the vice-president raised more than $80m (£62m) in new donations in the 24 hours since Mr Biden’s announcement – the biggest one-day total of any candidate this election cycle. That, along with the nearly $100m she inherits from the Biden-Harris fundraising coffers, gives her a firm financial footing for the campaign to come. Ms Harris, if she becomes the nominee, also defuses one of the most effective attacks the Republicans have levelled against their opponent: his age.  For months, the Trump campaign has been pounding Mr Biden for being feeble and easily confused – characterisations that were reinforced for many Americans after the president’s halting debate performance four weeks ago. The vice-president, at age 59, will be a more energetic campaigner and able to make a more coherent case for her party. She could also turn the 78-year-old Trump’s age against him, as he would become the oldest person ever elected president. Ms Harris may also be able to shore up support from black voters, who polls indicate had been drifting away from Mr Biden in recent months. If she can combine that with more backing from other minorities and younger voters – Barack Obama’s winning coalition from 2008 and 2012 – it could help her gain ground against Trump in the handful of swing states that will decide this year’s election. Her background as a prosecutor could also burnish tough-on-crime credentials. While her law-enforcement resume was a liability when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 – and led to derisive “Kamala is a cop” attacks from the left – it could help her in a campaign against Trump.   The vice-president has also been the administration’s point person on abortion, which has proven to be one of the most potent issues for motivating the Democratic base in recent elections. Mr Biden, by contrast, sometimes had been a reluctant advocate on the issue, hampered by a past record of supporting some limits on the procedure. “I think she reminds suburban women across the country, particularly in those battleground states, of what's at stake with reproductive rights,” former New York congressman Steve Israel, who headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told the BBC’s Americast podcast.  ""We have established a fundamental reset in the campaign.” For all Harris’s potential strengths, there is a reason why some Democrats were initially reluctant to push Mr Biden to step aside, given that his running mate would be the clear successor. Despite generating Democratic enthusiasm on the subject of abortion, Ms Harris's record as vice-president has been mixed. Early in the administration, she was set the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border. A number of missteps and misstatements - including a ham-handed June 2021 interview with NBC News presenter Lester Holt – damaged her standing and opened her to conservative attacks. Republicans are already condemning her as the president’s “border czar”, attempting to make her the face of what public opinion polls have found is the Biden administration's unpopular immigration policies. “Immigration is a soft spot for Democrats in those battleground areas,” Mr Israel said. “This is a very salient issue for voters living in those suburbs, fairly or unfairly. They believe that our immigration system is not managed strongly enough.” The Trump campaign will also try to turn the vice-president’s prosecutorial background against her – both by highlighting the former president’s record of enacting criminal justice reform and by attacking her past prosecutorial and parole decisions. Another Harris vulnerability is her chequered track record as a candidate. In her 2016 Senate bid, she faced only token opposition from Republicans in deeply Democratic California.  Her one solo run for national office – a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – ended in ruins. While she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primary contests. Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ms Harris is that, unlike the president, she is not the incumbent. While she might have the opportunity to distance herself from some of the more unpopular elements of Mr Biden’s record, she also does not have the luxury of being a known quantity for voters. Expect a furious effort by Republicans to paint Ms Harris as too untested and too risky to be president. In effect, Trump now has a greater claim to being the only proven commodity. The vice-president has a chance, in the days ahead, to make a new first impression with the American public. If she stumbles out of the gate, it could open the door to an extended power struggle that stretches into the Democrat’s national convention in late August. They could end up with the party uniting behind a different candidate – or tearing itself apart. As the past four weeks have shown, fortunes in the White House race can shift quickly and permanently. Ms Harris has punched her ticket to the biggest stage in American politics – now she has to show she can compete.",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c035dp3glypo,Unknown,Unknown,
669,"Damage, destruction and fear along the Israel-Lebanon border","BBC analysis has uncovered the extent of damage caused by nine months of fighting between the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israel. Satellite photos, radar imagery and records of military activity show that entire communities have been displaced, with thousands of buildings and large swathes of open land damaged on the border between Israel and Lebanon. Both sides have so far stopped short of all-out war, but evidence shows that near daily attacks have left communities in both Israel and Lebanon devastated. The current fighting began when Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions, which the group said was in solidarity with the Palestinians, a day after the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war. Israel’s military offensive on Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Data gathered by the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled) and analysed by the BBC suggest both sides together carried out a combined 7,491 cross-border attacks between 8 October 2023 and 5 July 2024. These figures indicated that Israel has carried out around five times as many as Hezbollah. The UN says the attacks have forced more than 90,000 people in Lebanon from their homes, with around 100 civilians and 366 Hezbollah fighters killed in Israeli strikes. In Israel, officials say 60,000 civilians have had to abandon their homes and 33 people have been killed, including 10 civilians, because of attacks by Hezbollah. Analysis reveals more than 60% of the border communities in Lebanon have suffered some kind of damage as a result of Israeli air and artillery strikes. As of 10 July, more than 3,200 buildings may have suffered damage. The findings were put together by Corey Scher of City University of New York Graduate Center. They are based on comparisons of two separate images, revealing changes in the height or structure of buildings which suggests damage. The towns of Aita el Shaab, Kfar Kila and Blida appear to have been among the worst affected. Aita el Shaab has been extensively hit, with at least 299 attacks since October, according to Acled. Buildings along the main road of the town, including restaurants and shops have particularly suffered damage. The BBC spoke to the mayor of Aita el Shaab, who described the town “as if it was hit by an earthquake”. Majed Tehini said 17 people from the town have been killed in the Israeli strikes, including two civilians. He left Aita el Shaab with his family immediately after the hostilities started in October last year, but he said he returned almost every fortnight, mainly to attend funerals. “Every time I visit, I feel it has changed. The sight of the destruction is just terrible,” he told the BBC. “The houses of Aita have become mere structures. The destroyed ones have been reduced to rubble. Those still standing are uninhabitable”, he added. Mr Tehini recalled seeing the town destroyed in the past, mainly in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, but he says the bombs have caused much bigger destruction this time. He explained that all the infrastructure has been damaged, including the electrical grid and the water supply system. “Our house is still standing. But it’s just by appearance. It’s all ruined”. he added More than 200 attacks targeted Kfar Kila, damaging several supermarkets and service shops in the central area of the town, according to Acled Blida town has also been hit at least 130 times since October, damaging several buildings as well as a pharmacy, according to Acled. The damage has been focused on the central part of the town where the main services, shops and facilities are located. Dr Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at Rusi said Israel is targeting towns in the border area because these are areas where it says Hezbollah is deeply entrenched. “Israel believes that they have sufficient documented evidence that there are a network for fortifications and tunnels in the vicinity of homes.” She said Israel is targeting this area to send a message to Hezbollah that they “should not be there”, but believes Hezbollah would find it unthinkable to evacuate. “The US has been trying to find a middle ground, such as getting Hezbollah to withdraw four miles from the border. Hezbollah has rejected this.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC it has carried out strikes against military targets to “remove the threat posed by Hezbollah to Israel, its citizens, and their homes”. Across the border, buildings in northern Israel have also been destroyed by strikes from the other side. Israeli media has reported more than 1000 buildings have been damaged since October. The IDF and the Israeli Ministry of Defence were contacted, but did not want to comment. But it’s the destruction of land which has been significant here. The BBC has used data supplied by Dr He Yin at Kent State University to examine the amount of land damaged by the huge wildfires that have been sparked by the cross-border attacks. Dr Yin processed data from publicly available satellite images filmed in near-infrared and shortwave infrared (which are outside the visible spectrum) to identify areas that are suspected to have been burned. This was checked against satellite photographs and local news reports. Huge amounts of land have been burnt in both countries, but the BBC estimates that Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights have been hit hardest, with around 55 sq km (21 sq miles) of land affected, compared to 40 sq km for Lebanon. Some recent estimates by Israel’s Nature and Park Authority have put this figure as high as 87 sq km. The pattern of damage shows that many of the areas burnt are set back from the border, which reflects the use of large numbers of unguided weapons by Hezbollah. These have been fired at civilian areas and military bases which aren’t immediately next to the frontier. If Israel’s anti-missile Iron Dome system detects that missiles will not land in populated areas, it does not intercept, leaving the missiles to land in the open. It results in extensive damage to agricultural land, farmland and forests. Dr Ozcelik said that’s intentional on the part of Hezbollah. “You could attribute the fires to the types of weapons that are being used but part of that story is that Hezbollah seeks to create chaos and a level of insecurity among the Israeli population which creates a pressure point on the Israeli government.” The scale of evacuation is “unheard of in the Israeli context,” Dr Ozcelik added. The scale of the damage is illustrated by images of the settlement of Katzrin in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. A huge swathe of burnt land, larger than the settlement itself, appeared after a barrage of rocket fire in early June. About 20 miles (30km) to the north east, lives Tzahi Gabay, a farmer and a member of the local response team. He is one of the few Israelis to remain in the border area. His wife and two children, aged 5 and 7, fled their town of Kfar Yuval, which lies just metres from the frontier, and have been living in a small hotel room for the past nine months. Mr Gabay sees them only once a week. He has seen first-hand the fires that have been devastating huge areas of northern Israel. “Fearing the rocket attacks, people neglected the vegetation and it dried up during the spring. Every UAV [drone], rocket or missile that was fired immediately ignited enormous fires in the Galilee. The entire area was burning. We had to fight the flames, to put out the fires, to prevent greater damage to our fields, to our businesses”, he added. The fires are not the only danger. His neighbours, Barak and Mira Ayalon, were killed in January. They were having lunch in the kitchen when a missile blasted through their living-room wall. Mr Gabay has known the family for years. “We grew up together. Removing their bodies in that condition… People I knew well… It wasn’t easy,” he sighs. While a small number of his town’s residents have stayed to keep their fruit trees alive, around 90% have evacuated, knowing theirs may never produce another harvest. Hezbollah did not respond to a request for comment. But its leader Hassan Nasrallah said on Wednesday that the Israeli “persistence in targeting civilians” would push the group’s fighters to target new “settlements” with missiles and warned Israel that its tanks would be destroyed if they crossed into Lebanon. And in a televised address on 10 July, he reiterated a vow to suspend his organisation’s attacks if a ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas. Most of the 40 sq km of land estimated by the BBC to have been affected by fire in Lebanon is close to or adjacent to the security barrier between the two countries. Lebanese Agriculture Minister Abbas Hajj Hassan told the BBC that 55 towns across the border line were affected by the fires caused by Israel. He accused Israel of using white phosphorous among other ammunition and of wanting to render the area barren and abandoned. White phosphorous is a chemical substance that ignites immediately on contact with oxygen. It sticks to skin and clothing and can even burn through bone. The international campaign group, Human Rights Watch, has verified the use of white phosphorus over several populated areas in southern Lebanon, including al-Bustan. It says Israel’s use of white phosphorus is “unlawfully indiscriminate in populated areas”. The IDF disputes this, saying the use of white phosphorus shells to create a smokescreen “is lawful under international law”. It says these shells are not used in densely populated areas “with certain exceptions”. According to the Acled data, the intensity of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah has not reduced since 8 October, with even a slight increase in the number of attacks between both sides in recent months. Dr Ozcelik said there are concerns that any further escalation in fighting could trigger an all-out war, which could even draw Iran into a direct confrontation with Israel in defence of Hezbollah. But, in a note of optimism, she said she believes both Israel and Hezbollah are trying to avoid that eventuality. “Both sides are being quite calibrated in their approach across the border to avoid a misfire or a human error or a miscalculation.” Additional reporting: Carine Torbey, Michael Shuval, Joya Berbery, Daniele Palumbo",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gj544x65o,Unknown,Unknown,
670,Netanyahu faces delicate balancing act in US after Biden exits race,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the US this week under pressure to end the Gaza war, from both Israelis and the US administration. How might the political turbulence in Washington shape the trip and future relations? Mr Netanyahu is set to meet Joe Biden – if the president has recovered from Covid-19 – and address a joint session of Congress, the only foreign leader to do so for a fourth time. The trip offers him a platform for a reset with Washington after months of tensions over his hardline approach to the war, and an opportunity to try and convince Israelis that he hasn’t undermined relations with their most important ally. But it is overshadowed by President Biden’s decision not to seek re-election, highlighting political uncertainties about Israel’s next partner in the White House and possibly eclipsing some of the attention on Mr Netanyahu’s visit. The prime minister got a lot of unwelcome attention in Israel until the moment he boarded the plane. A drumbeat of protests demanded that he stay home and focus on a ceasefire deal with Hamas to free Israeli hostages. “Until he has signed the deal that's on the table, I do not see how he picks up and flies across the Atlantic to address the American political chaos,” said Lee Siegel, one of the family members who has come out to demonstrate. His 65-year-old brother Keith is a captive in Gaza. The trip is a political move, he added, unless Mr Netanyahu stops being a “hurdle” and signs the ceasefire agreement. Mr Siegel reflected a widespread view that Mr Netanyahu is slow-rolling the process for his own political reasons, roiling his negotiators when he recently threw new conditions into talks that seemed to be making progress. The prime minister has been accused of bowing to pressure from two far-right cabinet ministers who’ve threatened to bring down his government if he makes concessions to Hamas. These perceptions have added to frustrations in the White House, which announced the latest formula for talks and had been expressing optimism an agreement could be achieved. Mr Biden remains one of the most pro-Israel presidents to sit in the Oval Office, a self-declared Zionist who’s been lauded by Israelis for his support and empathy, cemented by his flight to Israel just days after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. But since then, he’s grown alarmed at the cost of Mr Netanyahu’s demand for a “total victory” against Hamas in Gaza. The administration is frustrated with the Israeli prime minister for rejecting a post war solution that involves pursuing a Palestinian state. It’s angry with him for resisting appeals to do more to protect Palestinian civilians and increase the flow of aid to them. It’s facing a domestic backlash over the mounting death toll in Gaza. And it’s worried that the conflict is spreading to the region. As Joe Biden’s presidency weakened in the swirl of controversy over his abilities, analysts said there might be less room for him to keep up the pressure on the Israeli prime minister. But Mr Biden’s decision to drop out of the race could actually have strengthened his hand, says Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and a critic of Mr Netanyahu. “He is not a lame duck in regard to foreign policy, in a way he's more independent (because) he doesn't have to take into account any impact on the voters,” Mr Barak told the BBC.  “With regard to Israel probably he feels more of a free hand to do what really needs to be done.” Mr Barak believes it was a mistake for Congress to invite Mr Netanyahu to speak, saying that many Israelis blame him for policy failures that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, and three out of four want him to resign. “The man does not represent Israel,” he said. “He lost the trust of Israelis…And it kind of sends a wrong signal to Israelis, probably a wrong signal to Netanyahu himself, when the American Congress invites him to appear as if he is saving us.” Whatever politics he may be playing, Mr Netanyahu insists military pressure must continue because it has significantly weakened Hamas after a series of strikes against the military leadership. In comments before departing Israel, he suggested that would be the tone of his meeting with President Biden. “It will also be an opportunity to discuss with him how to advance in the months ahead the goals that are important for both our countries,” he said, “achieving the release of all our hostages, defeating Hamas, confronting the terror axis of Iran and its proxies and ensuring that all Israel’s citizens return safely to their homes in the north and in the south.” He’s expected to bring the same message to congress, “seeking to anchor the bipartisan support that is so important to Israel”. The reality is that Mr Netanyahu’s policies have dented that bipartisan support. The Republicans are rallying around him, but criticism from Democrats has grown. The Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer caused a small earthquake in Washington recently when he stood up in the chambers and said Mr Netanyahu was one of the obstacles standing in the way of a lasting peace with Palestinians. “I hope the prime minister understands the anxiety of many members in congress and addresses them,” the former US ambassador to Israel, Thomas Nides, told the BBC at the weekend. He’d been addressing one of the many rallies demanding a hostage release. That includes “on humanitarian issues and to articulate that this fight isn’t with the Palestinian people, it’s with Hamas."" It’s a message that Kamala Harris would repeat if she were to become the Democratic nominee. There’d be no change in US policy: a commitment to Israel’s security while pushing for an end to the Gaza conflict and a plan for the Day After embedded in a regional peace with Arab states. But there might be a difference in tone. Ms Harris does not share Mr Biden’s long history with and emotional ties to Israel. She’s from a different generation and “could more closely align with the sentiments of younger elements of the Democratic party,"" says Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East. ""That’s a stance more likely to include restrictions on weapons, on munitions from the United States for use in Gaza,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu could very well use the visit to steer the conversation from the controversy over Gaza to the threat from Iran, a topic with which he’s far more comfortable, especially after the recent escalation with Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. But his main audience will be domestic, says Tal Shalev, the diplomatic correspondent at Israel’s Walla News. He wants to revive his image as “Mr America,” she says, the man who can best present Israel to the US, and to restore his image which was shattered by the October 7 attacks. “When he goes to the US and speaks in front of Congress and [has] a meeting in the White House, for his electoral base, it's the old Bibi is back again,” she says, referring to the prime minister by his nickname. “This is not the failed Bibi who was responsible for the seventh of October. This is the old Bibi who goes to the Congress and gets the standing ovations.” It also gives him an opportunity to pursue connections with the former President Donald Trump at a time of great political flux in Washington. “Netanyahu wants President Trump to win,” she says, “And he wants to make sure that he and President Trump are on good terms before the election.” There is a widespread view that Mr. Netanyahu is playing for time, hoping for a Trump win that might ease some of the pressure he’s been facing from the Biden administration. “There is a near-universal perception that Netanyahu is eager for a Trump victory, under the assumption that he will then be able to do whatever he wants,” writes Michael Koplow of Israel’s Policy Forum. “No Biden pressuring him on a ceasefire or on West Bank settlements and settler violence... There are many reasons to doubt this reading of the landscape under a Trump restoration, but Netanyahu likely subscribes to it.” The question is whether that pressure from Biden will ease as he steps away from the presidential race, or whether he will in fact use his remaining months in office to focus on achieving an end to the Gaza war.",2024-07-23 23:11:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978qzgnd25o,Unknown,Unknown,
676,TV contestant killed and ate protected bird - NZ media,"A contestant on a US survival reality show killed and ate a protected bird in New Zealand while filming the series, according to local media reports. The show called Race to Survive, sees contestants largely having to hunt their own food. It filmed its second season in New Zealand. The bird, a weka, has become extinct over large parts of New Zealand- and is a fully protected species. The contestant and his teammate were both disqualified from the race as a result. Contestant Spencer 'Corry' Jones was aware he was breaking the rule when he killed and ate the bird, according to news site Radio New Zealand, citing a clip from the show.  In the clip, he was seen to have apologised, saying he made a ""foolish"" mistake and they ""didn't prepare for the hunger"". ""What I did disrespected New Zealand, and I'm sorry,"" he said. Mr Jones, along with his teammate Oliver Dev, were both disqualified in the eighth episode of the series.  New Zealand's Department of Conservation said they were alerted by a representative of the production company - US-based Original Productions - shortly after the incident occurred. Officials conducted an investigation and issued the company and the participant written warnings, citing ""unusual group dynamic situation"" such as fatigue and significant hunger of the cast members. ""Nonetheless, killing and eating a native protected species in this matter is unacceptable and the company is 'on notice' about the need for its programme participants to adhere to conservation legislation,"" Dylan Swain, team lead of investigations for the department, said in a statement to 1News. BBC News has asked Mr Jones and Original Productions for comment.  An iconic large flightless bird, the weka is famous for its feisty and curious personality. It has become extinct over large tracts of the mainland as a result of changing climatic conditions and rising predator numbers. But they can also be legally hunted on some islands in the country. A protected species under the Wildlife Act 1953, the maximum penalty for hurting the bird could be either two years imprisonment or a fine of NZD $100,000 ($59,545; £47,467).",2024-07-23 23:11:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2x08rl7vnxo,Unknown,Unknown,
675,Chimps share humans' 'snappy' conversational style,"Like humans, wild chimpanzees engage in snappy, turn-taking conversations, where they wait just a fraction of a second for their turn to 'speak'.  The animals communicate mostly with gestures including hand movements and facial expressions. Scientists who studied their chats in detail found that they took ""fast-paced turns"" when they exchanged information and also occasionally interrupted one another.   The revelation suggests ""deep evolutionary similarities [with humans] in how face-to-face conversations are structured,"" Prof Cat Hobaiter from the University of St Andrews told BBC News.  The findings are published in the journal Current Biology. This fast turn-taking is a hallmark of human conversation, explained Prof Hobaiter, who studies primate communication. ""We all take around 200 milliseconds between turns and show some interesting small cultural variations. Some cultures are ‘fast talkers’."" A millisecond is a thousandth of a second. One 2009 linguistics study timed these differences - showing that, on average,  Japanese speakers took seven milliseconds to respond while Danish speakers took about 470 milliseconds to intervene. By examining thousands of instances of wild chimpanzees communicating with each other, Prof Hobaiter and her colleagues were able to time the animals' conversations.  “It’s amazing to see how close the chimpanzee and human timings were,"" she said.  Chimps had a bigger range in their conversational timings. ""The gaps ranged from interrupting the signaller 1,600 milliseconds before they finished their gesture, to taking 8,600 milliseconds to respond,"" explained Prof Hobaiter.  “This could be because the chimps were in a natural setting, so they could express a wider range of behaviour - sometimes interrupting each other and other times taking a long time to respond."" As part of investigating the evolutionary origins of communication, the researchers have spent decades observing and recording the behaviour of five communities of wild chimpanzees in the forests of Uganda and Tanzania.  They have logged and translated more than 8,000 gestures from over 250 individual animals.  Lead researcher Dr Gal Badihi, also at the University of St Andrews, explained that gestures allowed the chimpanzees to avoid conflict and coordinate with each other.  “So one chimpanzee could gesture to another that they want food, and the other might give them food or, if they feel less generous, respond by gesturing for them to go away.  ""They might come to an agreement about how or where to groom. It’s fascinating, and done in just a few short gesture exchanges.” She said that future studies looking at communication in other primate species more distantly related to us will give us a more complete evolutionary picture of why we adopted this fast turn-taking chat. ""It will be a great way to better understand when and why our conversational rules evolved,"" she added.",2024-07-23 23:11:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c25lw18zrjyo,Unknown,Unknown,
674,Seized Mexican cartel 'monster trucks' destroyed,"Officials in Mexico have destroyed 50 ""monster trucks"" used by cartels in their gun battles. The vehicles, which are also referred to as ""Frankenstein trucks"" because of the modifications made to them - such as adding gun turrets and armoured plates -  were seized by the security forces.  They belonged to a number of criminal organisation, including The Scorpions, a group of hitmen working for the Gulf Cartel. Footage released by Mexico's federal prosecutor's office showed a crane toppling the heavy trucks before they were crushed.  Some of the trucks were painted in camouflage colours while others featured cartel markings. As they are not easy to manoeuvre, these ""monster trucks""  are most often deployed as a show of force or when cartel members expect to be involved in a gun battle.  Armourers in the pay of the cartels add bulletproof panels to the sides and sometimes battering rams to their fronts. Reinforced turrets from where machine guns can be fired are also a common feature.  The trucks' homemade armour has become more sophisticated since they were first spotted in 2010.  They are particularly popular with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Gulf Cartel.  The 50 trucks destroyed by the prosecutor's office on Monday were all seized in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.",2024-07-23 23:11:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gw3515jn0o,Unknown,Unknown,

671,Hungary stripped of EU meeting over Ukraine stance,"The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borell, has stripped Hungary of the right to host the next meeting of foreign and defence ministers over its stance on the war in Ukraine. It comes weeks after Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, a role in which it would normally host the event, and amid anger over a meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier this month.   Mr Borrell said Hungary's actions should have consequences and that ""we have to send a signal, even if it is a symbolic signal"". Hungary described the move as ""completely childish"".  Every six months, under each new council presidency, the EU's foreign and defence ministers hold informal meetings to discuss the biggest global issues facing the bloc.  The next set of meetings will take place on 28-30 August and were to be held in Budapest, but on Monday Mr Borrell announced they would instead take place in Brussels.  Citing comments made after the meeting with Mr Putin in which Mr Orban accused the EU of having a ""pro-war policy"", Mr Borrell told reporters: ""If you want to talk about the war party, talk about Putin. ""I can say that all member states - with one single exception - are very much critical about this behaviour. ""I think it was... appropriate to show this feeling and to call for the next foreign and defence council meetings in Brussels."" Of the 26 other countries in the EU, only Slovakia has backed Hungary in the dispute.  However, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel, told reporters that he would go to Budapest because a boycott would be ""nonsense"". Mr Bettel felt that it was  better to tell the Hungarians the EU was unhappy with their actions as ""ignoring or not choosing dialogue would be a mistake"". Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski proposed that the August meeting should take place in western Ukraine, but that idea was blocked by Budapest. Responding to Mr Borrell's decision, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on Facebook: ""What a fantastic response they have come up with. ""I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it feels like being in a kindergarten."" Mr Orban's meeting with Mr Putin came as part of what he described as a ""peace mission"" - launched days after Hungary assumed the council presidency - that also saw him visiting the leaders of Ukraine and China, as well as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the US.  The trip sparked condemnation from leaders across the EU, with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen describing it as ""nothing but an appeasement mission"". Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said Mr Orban had ""no mandate to negotiate or discuss on behalf of the EU"", while Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the trip sent ""the wrong signal to the outside world and is an insult to the Ukrainian people’s fight for their freedom"". The episode is one of numerous occasions since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on which Hungary has been at odds with most of the rest of the EU about the appropriate response.  After winning re-election in April 2022, just months after the invasion, Mr Orban told a crowd of supporters that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was among the people he would have to ""battle"" in his fourth term. Last year, he repeatedly used Hungary's veto to delay a €50bn (£42bn) package of non-military financial aid to Ukraine.

672,Leagues to sue Fifa over 'abuse of dominance',"The planned expansion of the Club World Cup has upset player unions The top European leagues, including the Premier League, and global players' union Fifpro will launch legal action against world governing body Fifa over its ""abuse of dominance"" in the game. The European Leagues, which represents 39 leagues and 1,130 clubs in 33 countries, says it is filing a complaint to the European Commission to protect the welfare of players. It comes following growing pressure from leagues and player unions, including the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), over the number of games added to the calendar and the impact on players. A Fifpro statement said the international calendar is ""now beyond saturation"", ""unsustainable for national leagues"" and a ""risk for the health of players"". It added: ""Fifa's decisions over the last years have repeatedly favoured its own competitions and commercial interests, neglected its responsibilities as a governing body, and harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players. ""Legal action is now the only responsible step for European leagues and player unions to protect football, its ecosystem and its workforce."" The statement said Fifa has ""consistently refused to include national leagues and player unions in its decision-making process"", having been urged to develop a clear and transparent process regarding the international match calendar. The European Leagues includes the English Football League, Scottish Professional Football League, Serie A and the Bundesliga. La Liga is not a member but is joining the action. In May Fifa rejected a claim that Fifpro and the World Leagues Association were not consulted over plans to host a 32-team Club World Cup. Manchester City and Chelsea are among the 12 European representatives at the expanded Club World Cup, to be held in the USA between 15 June and 13 July 2025. Fifa has responded strongly to the action, accusing some leagues of ""hypocrisy"" by sending their players on global pre-season tours.  A Fifa spokesperson said: ""The current calendar was unanimously approved by the Fifa Council, which is composed of representatives from all continents, including Europe, following a comprehensive and inclusive consultation, which included Fifpro and league bodies. ""Fifa's calendar is the only instrument ensuring that international football can continue to survive, co-exist, and prosper alongside domestic and continental club football. ""Some leagues in Europe - themselves competition organisers and regulators - are acting with commercial self-interest, hypocrisy, and without consideration to everyone else in the world. ""Those leagues apparently prefer a calendar filled with friendlies and summer tours, often involving extensive global travel. ""By contrast, Fifa must protect the overall interests of world football, including the protection of players, everywhere and at all levels of the game."" A recent study by the CIES Football Observatory, external - a research group at the International Centre for Sports Studies - on schedules and player workload suggested that clubs are not playing more matches per season. Its report found that between 2012 and 2024, the average number of fixtures per club and season sat at just over 40, with about 5% of clubs playing 60 or more games per season. No significant change was observed in the proportion of clubs playing 60 or more matches. Which Premier League clubs had most injuries? Football's schedule is 'killing the product' - PFA Are England 'too tired to press'? Six key charts The European Leagues' legal action is the second in two months against Fifa. The PFA is a co-claimant with the French and Italian players' unions in a claim filed at the Brussels court of commerce, with the support of the European office of Fifpro. That case focuses on employment law issues, the way Fifa manages the calendar, the introduction of new competitions and how they clash with employment rights for players. ""Fifa holds a dual role as both the global regulator of football and a competition organiser,"" Fifpro said. ""This creates a conflict of interest."" Maheta Molango, chief executive of the PFA and FifPro board member, said in May that players were at breaking point and could strike if they continue to be overworked. Because of the expanded Club World Cup, next year's African Cup of Nations has been moved from the summer to December 2025 and January 2026, which is also likely to impact that season's Champions League knockout stages. ""Legal action is the unfortunate but inevitable consequence of major stakeholders within the game - the leagues and the players - being ignored,"" said Molango. ""It's just not tenable to continue to argue that this approach to the fixture calendar is working. ""As always, it's the players who are expected to bend. As we have seen, eventually they will break. It has to stop."" Nick Mashiter, BBC Sport football news reporter This is the nuclear option. It is the red button the unions and leagues hoped not to press but they feel they have been left with no alternative.  Unions, by reputation, do not need to be asked twice to fight for the rights of their members but that fact the leagues - including the Premier League - are backing this action makes it significant.  The threat of legal action has been spoken about in football circles for over a year and there is now a united front, one the Professional Footballers' Association wanted to ensure before progressing. Fifa's response and argument against accuses some clubs of hypocrisy  - taking their players around the globe on summer tours - while also saying Fifpro is consulted over the calendar so expect a strong defence from the world governing body.  Yet there is a determination from all the complainants to follow both cases through if a resolution outside the courts is not found. Unions and leagues want to see a change from Fifa and, if not, this will go the distance.

677,Pope says 'ruthless' England can make 600 in a day,"England batter Ollie Pope made his Test debut against India in August 2018 Ollie Pope says England's batters will be ""ruthless"" with their run-scoring as they eye a Test series whitewash against West Indies - and reckons they could even score 600 in a day. England are 2-0 up after they followed up victory by an innings at Lord's with a comprehensive 241-run win at Trent Bridge last week. The win in Nottingham was the first time England scored 400-plus in both innings of a Test match with totals of 416 and 425. The third and final Test between England and West Indies starts on Friday at Edgbaston. Vice-captain Pope promised their will be no let up with their approach even though England have already wrapped up the series and won back the Botham-Richards Trophy. ""There’s a real hunger - there always is a hunger - but now there's an extra bit in that batting line-up,"" Pope said. ""We want to be as ruthless as we can as a batting unit, but still play the way we do because that's our natural game. Obviously being ruthless is being part of Test cricket as well."" This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Ollie Pope's century against the West Indies Pope was one of three England centurions in the second Test alongside Joe Root and Harry Brook. He acknowledged there are times England's batters will have to ""manage the game a little bit more"" but that their attacking approach has now become second nature. The 26-year-old also feels England could smash the record for the number of runs scored in a day of Test cricket with the buccaneering 'Bazball' style fostered by coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes Sri Lanka's total of 509-9 against Bangladesh in July 2002 is the highest total made by a team in a day of Test cricket. England fell just three runs short of eclipsing that against Pakistan in Rawalpindi back in December 2022, but Pope reckons they could go much bigger. ""I got asked on day one at Trent Bridge 'do you get told to play like that?'. No, we don't. It's just our natural games and the way we go about it,"" Pope added. ""Sometimes we might score 280 to 300 in a day but that's OK and probably because we're reading situations.  ""There might also be a day where we go and get 500 to 600 at some point in the future as well. And that's a cool thing to have.""

Table Oval Invincibles began their defence of The Hundred men's competition with an eight-wicket demolition of Birmingham Phoenix. Phoenix had slumped to 10-4 from 17 balls after some poor shot selection as Saqib Mahmood and Mohammad Amir picked up two wickets apiece. Rishi Patel (25), Benny Howell (24) and Jacob Bethell (22) were their only batters to make double figures as they tried to rebuild the innings. But Phoenix could only muster 89 with 19 balls unused as spinner Adam Zampa proved the pick of the Invincibles' attack with 3-11. Tawanda Muyeye's breezy 24 got the hosts off to a positive start before he and Will Jacks both fell to Tim Southee, who claimed 2-20. Phoenix were unable to make any further inroads as Invincibles skipper Sam Billings and opener Dawid Malan guided them home with ease, finishing unbeaten on 31 and 24 respectively.

England seamer Mahmood (2-25) and Pakistan fast bowler Amir (2-7) did the early damage for the Invincibles with the ball. Wicketless Sam Curran had a quiet night with the ball for the Invincibles, with the England all-rounder bowling just one set for 14 runs, but did take a stunning catch to dismiss Livingstone.

Paige Scholfield whacked 71 as Oval Invincibles cruised to a 45-run win over a lacklustre Birmingham Phoenix in the opening match of The Hundred women's competition. Scholfield's knock off 40 balls was her maiden half-century in the competition and featured 12 fours as she and Alice Capsey (52) shared a 90-run stand for the second wicket. Emily Arlott finished the pick of the Phoenix bowlers as she claimed 2-19, but the Invincibles' total of 150-5 put them in a commanding position. Phoenix, who did not win a single match in last year's tournament, had never successfully chased more than 128 in The Hundred. An 11th consecutive defeat for Phoenix felt inevitable when star overseas trio Suzie Bates (6), Ellyse Perry (0) and Sophie Devine (13) failed to make an impact.

The dressage star had already pulled out of Paris 2024 after a video emerged which she said showed her ""making an error of judgement"". The FEI said it had received footage showing three-time Olympic gold medallist Dujardin ""engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare - during a training session conducted at Ms Dujardin's private stable"". A lawyer representing the claimant who filed an official complaint against Dujardin to the FEI said in an accompanying letter seen by the BBC ""the video shows Ms Dujardin beating a horse excessively with a whip"". They added: ""My client is aware that this complaint could have far-reaching consequences for Ms Dujardin, including disciplinary sanctions. My client had to think long and hard about whether to bring this to your attention this way."" BBC Sport has not seen the video in question. However the FEI said Dujardin confirmed she was the individual in the video which was ""filmed several years ago"" and ""requested to be provisionally suspended pending the outcome of the investigations"". The body initially announced a six-month suspension but later said the ban would ""remain in place pending the outcome of the investigation/disciplinary proceedings"". Although the ban remains provisional while the FEI investigates, Dujardin, who has six Olympic medals in total, has said she will ""withdraw from all competition while this process takes place"". ""What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse,"" she said in statement. ""I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment."" Both the British Equestrian (BEF) and British Dressage (BD) have also imposed a provisional suspension on Dujardin pending the outcome of the FEI investigation. In a statement the FEI added it ""intends to proceed [its investigation] as swiftly as possible"". ""It is our responsibility and crucial that we address any instances of abuse, as equine welfare cannot be compromised,"" said FEI president Ingmar De Vos. ""Charlotte [Dujardin] has expressed genuine remorse for her actions, and we recognise and appreciate her willingness to take responsibility.  ""Despite the unfortunate timing, we believe this action reaffirms the FEI's commitment to welfare as the guardians of our equine partners and the integrity of our sport."" At the last Olympics in Tokyo in 2021, German modern pentathlon coach Kim Raisner was disqualified from the Games for appearing to punch a horse. That incident sparked a major overhaul of the event with the equestrian element replaced by an obstacle course. Becky Moody and her horse Jagerbomb are Team GB's alternate combination for the dressage. The British Olympic Association (BOA) said it ""will be applying to bring in a reserve athlete under the IOC's Late Athlete Replacement rules"". It added: ""The BOA takes animal welfare extremely seriously, and we believe that everyone has a responsibility for ensuring the wellbeing of horses."" British Dressage chief executive Jason Brautigam said: ""These historic allegations are deeply upsetting for everyone involved in our sport, but we fully support the FEI investigation and will take any appropriate disciplinary action when this process is complete."" British Equestrian chief executive Jim Eyre said the BEF would ""fully comply with any [FEI] requests to fulfil their investigation"".  He added: ""As the guardians of equestrian sport, we must uphold the highest standards of equine welfare – the horse's wellbeing is paramount."" Roly Owers, chief executive of World Horse Welfare, said: ""We know that a successful future for horse sport has public trust at the centre of it. The public has to trust that equestrians are caring and are treating their horses with respect, compassion and understanding.  ""If that trust is damaged it will damage the sport. This is another massive wake-up call for anyone who thinks this is not important, because it most certainly is."" Dujardin, 39, won team and individual gold medals at the London 2012 Games on Valegro, and the pair went on to win individual gold and team silver four years later in Rio. On a different horse, Gio, she won two bronzes at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games. Dujardin had been set to compete in both the individual dressage and team event alongside Carl Hester and world champion Lottie Fry, on new horse Imhotep. She needed a medal of any colour to take the outright lead as most-decorated British female Olympian from now-retired cyclist Dame Laura Kenny. Speaking to BBC Sport last week, Dujardin said it felt ""surreal"" to be on the cusp of that achievement and doing so would be ""one of the most incredible moments"". Dressage is the oldest equestrian discipline, and sees rider and horse perform a series of movements to music across the gaits of walk, trot and canter. Analysis - Laura Scott, BBC Sport news correspondent  This news was shocking when it broke and caught a lot of people off guard within the British Olympic setup. It will undoubtedly rock the team with the Games just about to start. When I went to visit Dujardin at her yard in Gloucestershire three weeks ago, she was confident about making history in Paris and told me she wanted to make her young daughter proud. She was considered a gold medal contender both individually and with the team. Now she won't be at the Games at all. But beyond the impact on Team GB's medal hopes, this story could have major ramifications for the general acceptance of equestrian sport in society. She is one of the faces of British sport and animal welfare is a subject that draws intense scrutiny. With only three days before the opening ceremony, the timing of this couldn't be worse, and the consequences could be huge.

683,Police investigating 'gang rape' of Australian woman in Paris,"French police are investigating after an Australian woman said she was raped by five men in central Paris. The 25-year-old woman took refuge in a kebab shop in the Pigalle district on Saturday morning with her dress partially torn off, local media reported. No arrests have yet been made but prosecutors confirmed officers are treating the investigation as ""gang rape"". The incident happened just days before the opening of the 2024 Olympics in the French capital. According to French newspaper Le Parisien, restaurant owners called for help when they saw the woman's state.  She was looked after by firefighters following the alleged assault and was later taken to Bichat hospital to be examined by medical professionals. The Paris Prosecutor's Office said police were investigating the allegations and that CCTV footage was being looked at.  “The investigation into the charge of gang rape likely to have been committed on the night of 19 to 20 July has been entrusted to the second judicial police district,” it said. There is currently a huge police presence on the ground in Paris in order to maintain the safety of those in the city during the Olympics, which begin on Friday. Officers have been patrolling in big numbers since last week in Paris, with armed guards around the River Seine. Several security zones have also been set up around the city with Paris split into zones. Anyone wishing to enter certain zones, including the Eiffel Tower, will have to apply for a special games pass on a platform run by police.",2024-07-23 23:11:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6rkg75gko,Unknown,Unknown,
690,Netanyahu defends Gaza war as protesters rally outside US Congress,"Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu told US lawmakers ""our enemies are your enemies"" in a landmark speech to Congress intended to rally support for the war in Gaza, but marked by protests inside and outside the Capitol. ""When we fight Iran, we're fighting the most radical and murderous enemy of the United States of America,"" Mr Netanyahu said.  ""Our fight is your fight, and our victory will be your victory,"" he added. The Israeli leader received a raucous reception from mostly Republican politicians as he delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress, his fourth. But growing political divisions over the war in Gaza were underscored by the dozens of Democratic members of Congress deliberately not present and thousands of protesters on the streets outside. Crowds gathered by a stage on Capitol Hill decked with banners, including one declaring the Israeli leader a ""wanted war criminal,"" a reference to an arrest warrant sought by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Five people were arrested inside the Capitol building for attempting to disrupt Mr Netanyahu's address, according to police. Addressing the protestors, Mr Netanyahu said: ""You have officially become Iran's useful idiots."" In one of many references to Iran, the Israeli prime minister claimed an “axis of terror” threatened the US, Israel and the Arab world, framing it as a “clash of barbarism against civilisations”. The term riffed off what Iran describes as the ""axis of resistance,"" an alliance across the Middle East including the Palestinian group Hamas, the Lebanese organisation Hezbollah and the Houthis, who rule parts of Yemen. He told Congress that Iranian proxy forces had attacked American targets, adding that Iran believes that ""to truly challenge America it must first conquer the Middle East"". ""But in the heart of the Middle East, standing in Iran's way, is one proud pro-American democracy: my country, the state of Israel."" Speaking for over an hour, Mr Netanyahu deflected criticism of Israel and framed the war in Gaza as his country’s battle for survival, in a pitch for further US military aid. He thanked the US for providing Israel with ""generous military assistance"" for decades, adding that in return Israel had provided the US with critical intelligence that had ""saved many lives"". But he called for a process of ""fast-tracking"" US military aid, claiming this could expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader regional war. Quoting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's appeal to the American people during World War Two, he said: ""Give us the tools and we'll finish the job."" Mr Netanyahu did not discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza at length, except to maintain that Israel delivers enough food aid to provide each person with 3,000 calories. If Gaza's residents were not getting food, he said, it was because ""Hamas steals it"". Outlining his vision for the Gaza Strip after the war, he called for ""a demilitarised and deradicalised"" enclave under Israeli military control.  ""Gaza should have a civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel. That's not too much to ask,"" he said. He made no reference to the prospect of an eventual two-state solution, something President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris - who is likely to replace him as the Democratic Party nominee - want. Several standing ovations could not disguise the fact that at least 39 lawmakers  were absent from the address.  Almost all were Democrats, among them influential former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who said it was ""inappropriate"" for Mr Netanyahu to visit. Ms Harris was not in attendance, reportedly due to a scheduling clash.  Throughout the speech, Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American member of Congress, was seen holding a placard in the air, which read ""guilty of genocide"" and ""war criminal"". Conscious that Donald Trump could return to the White House, Benjamin Netanyahu also thanked the former president for moving the American embassy to Jerusalem and for recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a territory Israel conquered from Syria in 1967. The two men will meet in Florida later this week. At home in Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza gathered to condemn the speech as it was broadcast, silently, on to the central area known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv. After listening to the national anthem, the crowd dispersed as Netanyahu continued his address on screen.  The audio was muted, but his English speech was shown with subtitles in Hebrew translation. Shortly after the end of the speech, the Israeli army announced it had retrieved the bodies of two hostages, Maya Goren and Oren Goldin, from Gaza. The news underscored the growing despair many hostage families feel towards the prospect of seeing their loved ones alive again, with monthslong hostage negotiations still not having borne fruit. The prime minister's address to Congress came nine months into Israel's campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 39,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",2024-07-24 23:10:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng9ed3gj0o,Unknown,Unknown,
689,Ukraine thrown into war's bleak future as drones open new battlefront,"The black box sits on the army truck dashboard like a talisman, its tiny screen lighting up with warnings when Russian drones are above us. We are driving fast along a country road in the darkness near the front lines outside Kharkiv. Like many in this war, the soldiers inside have come to revere the little cube they call ""sugar""; it warns of the unseen dangers above. On the vehicle’s roof are three mushroom-shaped antennas that make up separate drone-jamming equipment. The car emits an invisible aura of protection that will thwart some, but not all, of the Russian attack drones patrolling the skies above this battlefield. ""It has detected the Zala Lancet Russian drones,"" says Senior Lt Yevhenii, 53, from the front passenger seat, describing one of the most powerful long range Russian drones and its targeting drone. ""Is that why we’re driving so fast?"" I ask, aware that the drone-jamming antenna is useless against a Lancet. ""We’re not a priority for them, but it’s still better not to slow down because it’s very dangerous,"" says Yevhenii, from the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard. The jamming equipment blocks roughly 75% of frequencies that drones use to communicate with their operators, but some like the Lancet are difficult to block because they are entirely autonomous once their target has been marked. Because of the Lancet’s power, it tends to be used on larger targets, such as armoured vehicles or infantry positions, the Ukrainians say. Almost none of this technology was here in Ukraine a year ago; now it is commonplace. Drones, which were once peripheral to the war are a central component for both sides, alongside infantry and artillery as Ukraine struggles to hold back Russian advances. Ukraine has been thrown into the bleak future of war, where within minutes individual soldiers, fast-moving vehicles and trench positions can be precisely targeted. Drones have civilians in their sights too: about 25 from Russia attacked Kharkiv on Tuesday night, although most were intercepted. Ukraine's army is fighting back with its own drones, and there are dozens across this stretch of front line. One Ukrainian soldier tells me every day they kill 100 Russians. The last images from drone cameras are usually of men panicking, their arms flailing, weapons firing before they are killed. The brigade’s 37-year-old drone commander, who goes by the call sign Aeneas, says that without shelter in a building there is little chance of survival - for Russians, and his men too. ""It's the new way or a new path in modern war. In 2022 it was only infantry war and today one half is only a war of drone, a battle between Russian drones and ours,"" he says. The move to drone warfare is a combination of necessity and innovation. Drones are in plentiful supply, even though when armed they lack the explosive fire power of artillery.  Ukraine has consistently run short of artillery shells, and its allies have been slow to produce and supply them. But a Drone Coalition of Ukrainian allies has pledged to supply the country with a million drones this year. Russia has made its own innovations on the battlefield too, using an older technology, and the village of Lyptsi, just six miles (10km) from the Russian border, has paid the price. It was devastated by glide bombs - Soviet-era ""dumb bombs"" fitted with fins and a satellite guidance system. Some are as large as 3,000kg (6,600lbs) and, when launched from aircraft, glide onto Ukrainian infantry positions and towns to highly destructive effect. One woman named Svitlana, who was driven out of Lyptsi by these attacks, told us: ""Everything was exploding all around. Everything was burning. It was scary there. It was impossible to even get out of the cellar."" Aeneas takes us on a tour of his drone teams, embedded along the front line in Lyptsi. Every vehicle we encountered near there was fitted with drone-jamming equipment; but the jammer’s protection ends when you exit the vehicle. It’s dangerous to be caught out in the open, so we follow Aeneas running across the rubble for cover. All the while the BBC's own drone detector calls out calmly into an earpiece: ""Detection: multiple drones, multiple pilots. High signal strength."" Out of breath, we make it to the drone unit’s underground base beneath a ruined building, where we are introduced to two operators, Yakut and Petro. There are drones on every surface, next to a frying pan with their evening meal. They get through many hundreds of drones in a month, as most are single-use and detonate on their target. Their weapon of choice is the First Person View (FPV) drone, which carries a payload of between 1kg (2.2lbs) and 2kg of explosive, packed with shrapnel. The drones are modified off-the-shelf models which have cameras to send video back to their remote operators. ""We call them celebration drones in Ukraine. They were used to film weddings and parties before the war,"" Aeneas says. I watch on a screen in real time beside Yakut who is fixed in concentration flying a drone manually to a target, across open fields and woodland. ""He knows every puddle, every tree in the area,"" Petro says. The FPV drone approaches a building where a Russian soldier is believed to be hiding. It flies through an open window and detonates, the operator's screen turning to static as the signal is lost. At the same time, another drone team is targeting a Russian Tigr light-armoured vehicle and scores a direct hit, captured by a second surveillance drone that’s watching from above. The men stay on these positions, flying missions day and night, for up to five days at a stretch and spend as little time outside as possible. Their biggest fear is glide bombs: one landed nearby earlier that week, and the whole building shook. What happens if there’s a direct hit? I ask Petro. ""We die,"" he replies. Aeneas shows me a recording from earlier in the week: a Russian soldier is caught in the open and the unit’s drone has him in its sights. The soldier notices it and runs for cover, hiding in a drainage culvert by the roadside. Slowly the drone lowers to its level, checking one side of the drainage pipe, then going around the other side, where the soldier is hiding. It detonates and the man is blown out, dying by the roadside. ""He was divided into two parts,"" explains Aeneas. The operators are cool and dispassionate, almost clinical in their targeting and killing. They are as far as three miles (5km) away from their targets, one step removed from the immediate blood and guts of the battlefield. But encountering these weapons on the frontline is nerve-wracking. A few days later, after dark, at an infantry trench close to Russian positions, a unit commander tells me he believes the Ukrainians have the upper hand in drone warfare, the Russians the advantage with glide bombs.  Russia also has the advantage in drone numbers: six for every Ukrainian one, although the drone teams I was with say they have the technological edge and are quicker at finding ways to counter-attack and jam Russian drones. The trench is in a wooded copse, surrounded by fields, a thick canopy of trees provides cover. But as we are speaking a Russian FPV drone is detected and begins to move closer to the position. The few dim lights, mostly phone screens, are turned off in the trench, and the men sit silently as the drone’s approach gets louder. We hold our breath as it hovers overhead. For what seems like an age, no one dares move. But then the drone moves on, in search of another target. The largest drone in the brigade’s arsenal is the Vampire, which with its six rotors is the size of a coffee table. Again we join Aeneas on another mission in Lyptsi after dark, under the sound of constant artillery fire, where we meet the heavy bomber team. They work to attach the bomb to the drone.  ""Ten kilograms, the Russians call this drone the Bogeyman,"" says Aeneas. It’s payload is powerful enough to take out their intended target, a Russian command post, they say. As the men work, a Russian drone makes a number of passes overhead: each time it does, the soldiers retreat into the basement, wait for the all-clear, then resume the assembly. As the drone takes off into the night in a cloud of dust, they watch its progress again from a second surveillance drone. Just then, with barely any warning, we see on the drone’s thermal camera three Russian glide bombs detonating over the Ukrainian position, over a kilometre away. The shock waves are visible: seconds later they reach our location and the house around us shudders violently. Ukraine’s allies know that by supporting the drone effort, they are helping the country’s cause, but it isn’t simply an act of charity. The head of the British military, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, has said that the UK’s armed forces can learn from Ukraine how to fight future wars. He said in a speech on Tuesday that he wants the Army to have ""battalions of one-way attack drones"". Aeneas and his men know this. As we leave their position, a Russian drone returns and we drive off at speed into the darkness. In the truck he tells me: ""No one is fighting war this way - they are learning from us. This will be the future war."" Follow Quentin on X",2024-07-24 23:10:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4vl9gy2wo,Unknown,Unknown,
687,Trump rally gunman searched online for JFK assassination details,"The gunman who targeted Donald Trump at a campaign rally earlier this month researched the assassination of John F Kennedy in the days before the shooting, FBI Director Christopher Wray has said.  Mr Wray testified on Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee about the 13 July shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign.  A bullet grazed Trump's right ear and the attack left one rally audience member dead and two others badly wounded. The gunman also used a firearm with a ""collapsible stock"", likely making it easier to conceal, Mr Wray said.  In his opening remarks, the FBI director called the attempted assassination of Trump ""an attack on our democracy and our democratic process"". ""We will not and do not tolerate political violence of any kind, especially a despicable account of this magnitude,"" he told lawmakers.  Mr Wray said that on 6 July - a week before the shooting - the gunman searched ""how far away was Oswald from Kennedy"" online and registered for the Trump rally. Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed President Kennedy in 1963.  The FBI head said on Wednesday that the agency still does not have a motive for the assassination attempt but the gunman appears to have become ""very focused"" on Trump a week before the shooting.  Investigators also found the gunman had conducted searches for news articles about other public figures.  Mr Wray said the shooter fired at least eight shots. Officials recovered eight cartridges on the roof where the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was located.  Crooks was killed by a counter sniper during the incident.  The AR-style rifle used in the shooting had a collapsible stock, which can make a weapon shorter and easier to transport.  The first people to see the gunman with a rifle did so when he was already on the roof from where he fired, Mr Wray said. He added that a local officer observed the gunman seconds before he fired shots.  Investigators are working to determine whether Crooks took the gun onto the roof or if it was placed there in advance. The FBI director also confirmed that the gunman flew a drone over the rally about two hours before the shooting.  Additionally, the FBI found three ""relatively crude"" explosive devices - one in the gunman's home and two others in his car.  These devices were capable of being detonated remotely and the gunman had a transmitter, Mr Wray said.  It did not appear as if the Crooks would have been able to detonate them from the roof where he was perched at the time of the shooting, he added.   The investigation also revealed the gunman went to a shooting range, where he fired an AR-style rifle, the day before the rally. The FBI believes it to be the same weapon used in the assassination attempt.  Mr Wray said there is no evidence that the gunman planned the attack with others.  Investigators are exploring a number of Crooks' digital devices, he said, adding that the shooter meets the description of a ""loner"" and had few contacts in his phone.  Upon searching his home, officials found about 14 firearms associated with him and his family.  The FBI is handling the criminal investigation into the attempted assassination and Mr Wray told the committee the agency will ""leave no stone unturned"".  ""The men and women of the FBI will continue to work tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened,"" he said. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned from her position on Tuesday after testifying before a different congressional committee earlier this week.    She faced calls from both Democrats and Republicans to step down after the contentious  hearing, during which lawmakers became increasingly frustrated after she refused to answer questions about the attempted assassination.",2024-07-24 23:10:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9vp4mkjpdo,Unknown,Unknown,
688,Yellowstone blast sends visitors fleeing for cover,"Visitors were forced to flee as a huge hydrothermal explosion shot steam and debris into the air at Yellowstone National Park  Videos show dozens of people running as a large column of grey mud shoots from the ground, sending rocks and boiling water high into the air around Biscuit Basin. The National Parks Service reported no injuries but said the nearby boardwalk and benches were damaged in the blast on Tuesday.  The service closed the area, a few miles from the Old Faithful geyser.  A US Geological Survey photograph shows a huge grey area of debris thrown out by the eruption.  The survey said that a hydrothermal explosion is caused by water flashing to steam in a shallow hydrothermal system.  Surrounding rocks are blown apart as the steam expands. The often violent events result in the ""rapid ejection of boiling water, steam, mud, and rock fragments"". They can reach heights of 1.2 miles (2km) and leave huge craters. Most of the ejected material is called breccia - angular rocks cemented by clay.  The survey said hydrothermal explosions can pose significant local hazards and damage or destroy thermal features.  In Yellowstone, the explosions are not related to volcanic activity.  Similar eruptions occurred in Biscuit Basin in 2009, 1991 and after an earthquake in 1959.

686,Press battle 'central' to Royal Family rift - Harry,"The Duke of Sussex has said his decision to fight against intrusion from the tabloid press has been a ""central piece"" behind the breakdown of his relationship with the rest of the Royal Family. In December a High Court judge ruled that Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) had unlawfully gathered information for stories published about Prince Harry - and he has since been awarded hundreds of thousands of pounds in damages. Speaking for the first time since the four-year legal battle concluded, he said he felt ""vindicated"" by the ruling, calling it a ""monumental victory"". But in comments due to be aired as part of an ITV documentary on Thursday, Prince Harry added ""it would be nice if we did it as a family"". Prince Harry, who became the first British royal in 130 years to give evidence in a court, told the programme his decision to fight these cases had ""caused... part of a rift"" with the rest of his family. He and his wife, Meghan, stepped back as senior royals in 2020 after publicly revealing their struggles under the media spotlight. The prince, who now lives in the US state of California, also said he believed there was evidence his mother - the late Princess Diana - was hacked, claiming she ""was probably one of the first"" victims.  This has never been proven in court. ""The press, the tabloid press very much enjoy painting her as being paranoid, but she wasn't paranoid, she was absolutely right of what was happening to her,"" he said. Referring to one headline from the Daily Mirror brought up in his case against MGN which claimed his then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy was preparing to break up with him, the prince said it ""seems as though they knew something before I even did"".  ""I think there's a lot of... paranoia, fear, worry, concern, distrust in the people around you, clearly a headline like that has absolutely no public interest whatsoever,"" he said. The interview is due to air in a new ITV documentary, Tabloids on Trial, on Thursday evening. The programme speaks to other famous faces - including Hugh Grant, Charlotte Church and Paul Gascoigne - whose lives have been impacted by the press. In response to the documentary, an MGN spokesperson said: “We welcomed the judgment in December 2023 that gave the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago. ""Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid compensation,"" the spokesperson added. The case was just one of a series of legal challenges the prince has brought against parts of the British press. Cases against Associated Newspapers - the publisher of the Daily Mail - and News Group Newspapers - now News UK, which publishes the Sun - are currently making their way through the courts.",2024-07-24 23:10:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2e3p5gr2o,Unknown,Unknown,
702,What's happening and when at the Paris Olympics?,"The live sport has started at the Paris Olympics so what better way to plan ahead than with our day-by-day guide - all times BST.  Team GB has named a squad of 327 athletes and UK Sport has set a target of 50 to 70 medals at the Games.  There will be live coverage of Paris 2024 across the BBC on TV, radio and online.  The Games will be officially opened at a unique and spectacular opening ceremony along the River Seine on Friday, 26 July and will close on Sunday, 11 August. Full Paris 2024 schedule All you need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympics Highlights The women’s football group stage begins. GB did not qualify via England as the nominated home nation and neither did Sweden, losing finalists at the last two Olympics. Defending champions Canada begin against New Zealand (16:00). Hosts France play Colombia at 20:00. The men’s sevens isn’t hanging around. A day before the opening ceremony, we’ll be into the quarter-finals by 20:00. Fiji have won both Olympic men’s titles so far. New Zealand, who were the losing finalists last time, play Ireland (15:30) in the day’s final pool game. Brit watch Team GB’s archers will take part in their sport’s ranking round for the individual events. This does not eliminate anyone, it is simply a preliminary stage that seeds the archers for the main competition. World watch Emma Hayes, who just left Chelsea after 12 years in charge, will coach the US women at Olympic level for the first time when they face Zambia at 20:00. The US won four of the first five Olympic women’s football titles but have only been on the podium once since 2012, a bronze medal in Tokyo.  Expert knowledge  The first handball games of Paris 2024 run throughout the day as the women’s event starts. France’s handball team have shown incredible progress, going from a nation that never qualified for this event to the silver medallists in Rio and champions in Tokyo. They are also the defending world champions after winning gold without losing any of their nine games last year. Under handball’s rules, France as hosts got to choose their group having seen who had already been drawn. They wisely opted to avoid Norway, Denmark and South Korea, who have collectively won seven of the past nine Olympic titles and are all in the other group. France instead begin their campaign against Hungary, who came through a qualifying tournament to bag one of the remaining places, at 18:00. This video can not be played New United States head coach Emma Hayes ready for the 'biggest job in women's football' Highlights Opening ceremony - 18:30, with BBC TV coverage beginning at 17:45.  Around 300,000 people will watch from the banks of the River Seine as a parade of some 10,000 athletes takes place not in a stadium, but on boats for each team. The ceremony finale will take place at the Trocadero. No Olympic Games has held an opening ceremony like this before, so expect something completely different.  The plan comes with logistical and security complications that have challenged organisers, who chose earlier this year to limit the number of spectators at the water’s edge.  There is no sport scheduled at the Games on Friday, clearing the path for the ceremony to be the centre of attention. Brit watch None in action. World watch None in action. Expert knowledge  More than 90 boats will be in use for the opening ceremony, carrying not only the athletes but also a range of performers that you will see throughout the evening. Theatre director Thomas Jolly, who is the show’s artistic director, has pointed out there is no way to fully rehearse the show on the river. Instead, parts of the ceremony have been practised inside giant hangars and the boat captains are reported to have been rehearsing at a sailing centre. How to follow Paris 2024 Olympics across the BBC Gold medal events: Diving (women's synchro 3m springboard), fencing (women's epee, men's sabre), judo (women's -48kg, men's -60kg), road cycling (men's and women's individual time trial), rugby sevens (men's), shooting (mixed team 10m air rifle), skateboard (men's street), swimming (men's 400m free, women's 400m free, women's 4x100m free relay, men's 4x100m free relay). Highlights Road cycling’s time trial is a chance for Josh Tarling to get Team GB’s Olympics off to a flying start. The 20-year-old won the European title last year and is considered a contender in the men’s event, which for the first time at an Olympics uses the same course as the women’s, taking in sections of forest alongside Paris monuments like the Louvre and Eiffel Tower. The women’s time trial featuring GB’s Anna Henderson, a European silver medallist, starts at 13:30 with the men’s event at 15:34. In the swimming, Saturday night brings a hotly anticipated three or even four-way contest in the women’s 400m freestyle (19:55). US legend Katie Ledecky lost to Australia’s Ariarne Titmus in 2021 and Titmus won last year’s world title, too, while Canadian 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is the world record-holder. New Zealand’s Erika Fairweather is also expected to do well. The Brits have a shot at a medal in the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay (20:37). Adam Peaty will be competing in the 100m breaststroke heats (10:00). GB divers Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen go in the women’s 3m synchro from 10:00.

The first hockey match of Paris 2024 features Team GB’s men versus Spain (09:00). Spain are ranked eighth in the world. Team GB’s squad is predominantly English, and England are currently the world’s number two nation behind the Netherlands in men’s hockey. Ireland’s men face Belgium at 09:30. Gymnastics begins with men’s qualifying. Team GB are in subdivision one of three, starting at 10:00. Qualifying is what decides who makes the team final, all-around final and individual finals later in the Games. Max Whitlock, now 31, has a stated aim of becoming the first gymnast to win a medal on the same apparatus (in his case, the pommel horse) in four successive Olympics. This video can not be played Paris 2024: Max Whitlock's amazing Olympic career through art World watch From 16:00, skateboarding’s men’s street final could be dominated by Japan.

French hopes rest with world number nine and 2022 world champion Aurelien Giraud. For the US, legend of the sport Nyjah Huston is hoping to make up for missing out on a medal in Tokyo. In judo (medal contests from 16:18), Georgia’s Giorgi Sardalashvili produced a stunning result in May to become world champion in the men’s -60kg division aged just 20. France’s Luka Mkheidze, the Tokyo bronze medallist, will be going up against him, as will Spanish 2023 world champion Francisco Garrigos. Roland-Garros, the home of the French Open, hosts this year’s Olympic tennis. It is possible that this could be the last major event for Spain’s Rafael Nadal, an Olympic singles and doubles champion, who enters both events this time and teams up with Carlos Alcaraz in the doubles. Novak Djokovic has also said he is prioritising the Olympics – one of the few tennis titles the Serb has never won. Expert knowledge If you have just hopped across the Channel to Paris hoping to catch some of the Olympic surfing, bad news: it is in Tahiti, which is 10,000 miles away. This breaks the record for the furthest an event has ever taken place from the host city of an Olympics. Tahiti’s Teahupo’o wave is considered world-class and Tahiti is part of French Polynesia, a semi-autonomous territory of France. The men’s and women’s first rounds take place on Saturday. The first gold medal of Paris 2024 is likely to be shooting’s mixed team air rifle. The gold-medal round begins at 10:00. Michael Bargeron and Seonaid McIntosh are the British entrants. Gold medal events: Archery (women's team), canoe slalom (women's K1), fencing (men's epee, women's foil), judo (W -52kg, M -66kg), mountain bike (women's cross-country), shooting (men and women's 10m air pistol), skateboard (women's street), swimming (men's 400m individual medley, women's 100m fly, men's 100m breast). Highlights Team GB’s Adam Peaty is expected to challenge for a third consecutive men’s 100m breaststroke Olympic title in Sunday’s final at 20:54. This time, he has described himself as “the person with the bow and arrow and not the one being fired at” after a foot injury and time away from the sport to focus on his mental health. He was third at the world championships in February. Watch for China’s Qin Haiyang and American Nic Fink in the same event. Meanwhile, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand should line up in the final of the men’s 400m individual medley at 19:30. Marchand is one of the biggest names on the hosts' Olympic team and is expected to end a 12-year French gold-medal drought in the pool. When he was younger, Marchand wrote to American great Michael Phelps’ former coach, Bob Bowman, to ask if Bowman would be his coach. Bowman said yes and Marchand now has five world titles at the age of 22. Team GB's Evie Richards, the 2021 world champion, features in the women’s cross-country mountain bike event from 13:10. Richards is coming back from a concussion suffered in Brazil two months ago, so does not start the race as a favourite, but is still ranked inside the world’s top 15. Switzerland’s Alessandra Keller is the world number one. Watch out for young Dutch star Puck Pieterse and France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prevot. Chelsie Giles is the headline act in GB’s judo squad for Paris 2024. The 27-year-old won bronze in Tokyo then added European gold and world silver a year later. Giles is in the -52kg class, which is packed with talent like Japan’s Uta Abe, who has proved a hard obstacle for Giles to overcome in the past and has been sweeping up medals lately. GB have won 20 Olympic medals in judo but never a gold, meaning there is history on the line. Women’s medal contests begin at 16:49. It is impossible to look past South Korea in most archery events. This includes the women’s team event, which they have won every time since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1988. Not only were none of the current GB team born then, but their coach was four years old. However, this GB team are made of strong stuff. Penny Healey and Bryony Pitman have each been ranked world number one in the past year, so this could be a real opportunity for them to shine. The event begins at 08:30 with the gold-medal match at 16:11. Brit watch Helen Glover, an Olympic rowing champion in 2012 and 2016, is back for her fourth Olympics. This time she is in the women’s four alongside returning Olympian Rebecca Shorten and debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave (no relation to Sir Steve). They only got together at the start of the year but were unbeaten at a string of major events in the first half of 2024. Sunday’s rowing begins at 08:00, with the women’s four heats from 11:30. At the women’s rugby sevens, Team GB face Ireland in the opening group game at 14:30. GB have finished fourth at the past two Olympics, whereas this is the Irish women’s Olympic debut. Ireland go on to play South Africa at 18:00, while GB play Australia at 18:30. Kimberley Woods will line up for GB in canoe slalom’s K1 event (starts 14:30, final at 16:45). Woods had a “heartbreaking” Tokyo Games, finishing 10th, but believes she has grown mentally and physically in the years since. She is a contender in both this event and the kayak cross, which is making its Olympic debut later in the Games. Eventing heads into its second day, the cross-country, from 09:30. This involves a gallop of nine to 10 minutes through the park at Versailles, twice crossing the centuries-old Grand Canal in what might be one of the Paris Olympics’ signature views. In women’s hockey, Team GB begin their campaign against Spain at 12:15. GB beat Spain in a quarter-final shootout in Tokyo before going on to win bronze. Later on Sunday, at 19:15, the GB men play their second group game against South Africa. World watch In gymnastics, it is the women’s turn to head through qualifying. Britain are again in the first subdivision at 08:30. The United States and China are in subdivision two from 10:40. Team GB’s women took team bronze in Tokyo three years ago. The US, who are the defending world champions, are led once again by Simone Biles – now competing in her third Olympic Games aged 27, with a coincidental total of 27 world and Olympic titles already won. Men’s water polo begins on Sunday and is part one of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. Water polo is often described as the national sport of Hungary, who won 2023’s world title and have nine Olympic gold medals in this event, although none since 2008. What better way to start than against the hosts? France have a tradition of winning the Olympic men’s water polo title whenever it’s held in Paris – which unfortunately for them has only happened once, a century ago. France play Hungary at 18:30. Expert knowledge In women’s street skateboarding, where teenagers are often contenders, France will be represented by 14-year-old Lucie Schoonheere. Nobody in the top 10 of this event’s world rankings heading into the Olympics is aged older than 19. Japan’s Coco Yoshizawa, also 14, is the world number one. The final begins at 16:00. No sport has provided France with more Olympic medals than fencing – 123 of them at the start of Paris 2024, 30 more than cycling in second place. This brings us to part two of the day’s Franco-Hungarian action. If the Hungarians are the strong favourites against France in water polo, the men’s epee might give France more of a chance. Hungary’s Gergely Siklosi and Mate Koch are the world number one and two respectively, but when Siklosi lost the Olympic final in 2021, who beat him? France’s Romain Cannone. Cannone and veteran team-mate Yannick Borel are both in the world top five and on the team for Paris 2024. Japan and Italy will also be hoping to have a say. Expect the medal events in men’s epee and women’s foil from around 19:50. The young stars to follow at Paris 2024 This video can not be played Paris 2024: Adam Peaty watches emotional messages from family & friends Gold medal events: Archery (men's team), artistic gymnastics (men's team), canoe slalom (men's C1), diving (men's synchro 10m platform), equestrian (eventing jumping team, eventing jumping individual), fencing (men foil, women sabre), judo (W -57kg, M -73kg), mountain bike (men's cross-country), shooting (men's and women's 10m air rifle), swimming (women's 400m individual medley, men's 200m free, men's 100m back, women's 100m breaststroke, women's 200m free). Highlights  Tom Daley, now 30, is back for his fifth Olympic Games representing Team GB. He is paired with 24-year-old Noah Williams in the men’s 10m synchro, an event in which Daley won a dramatic Tokyo gold alongside Matty Lee. Daley and Williams are top-ranked coming into Paris 2024 but the rankings do not fully account for the threat from China, whose pairing of Lian Junjie and Hao Yang have won the past three world titles. The final starts at 10:00. In swimming, GB’s line-up for the men’s 200m freestyle is so strong that Tom Dean, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo, does not make the start list. Instead, Team GB will look to 2023 world champion Matt Richards and Tokyo silver medallist Duncan Scott. Watch out for Romania’s David Popovici, who is a second faster than anyone else this year heading into the event (final starts 19:43). Tom Pidcock is in the middle of an exhausting 2024. He arrives at the Paris Olympics immediately after Covid forced him out of the Tour de France, and then he will compete not just in road cycling but also in mountain biking’s cross-country event, which starts at 13:10. Pidcock’s electric performance to win this event three years ago was a British highlight in Tokyo, and he says defending that title is his priority. In the men’s team gymnastics final (from 16:30), GB have a shot at the podium. China and Japan have looked a class apart in recent years, but the Brits were third at the 2022 world championships and narrowly beaten into fourth by the US a year later. Max Whitlock was in the team that won bronze at London 2012 and has since had to endure back-to-back fourth-place Olympic finishes in this event. Eventing reaches its last day of action, concluding with showjumping from 10:00. Will GB be able to take back-to-back titles? The British are fielding an extraordinarily strong team but jumping is one of those sports where a first tiny error can rapidly become a catastrophe. Anything could happen, no matter how the dressage and cross-country set things up. Brit watch  Adam Burgess was 0.16 seconds away from a medal in canoe slalom’s C1 event at the Tokyo Games. Burgess has embarked on what he calls “project send it” ahead of Paris – learning to “send it a little bit more in the final” to make sure he can truly compete for medals on the Olympic stage. Also sending it from 14:30 will be Benjamin Savsek, the Slovenian who won gold in Tokyo and remains one of the top-ranked in the world. Seonaid McIntosh, from a shooting family, took European silver in the 10m air rifle last year and is inside the top 20 worldwide. The final starts at 08:30. Michael Bargeron competes in the men’s event from 11:00. In hockey, Ireland’s men play Australia at 09:00 before GB’s women play Australia at 16:00. In rugby sevens, GB’s women play South Africa at 13:00. Ireland play Australia at 13:30. World watch  Back at the swimming, the women’s 100m breaststroke (20:32) could become a battle royale. Team USA’s Lilly King is back in the mix after winning gold in 2016, as is Tokyo silver medallist Tatjana Smith, while Lithuania’s Ruta Meilutyte could also feature. China’s Tang Qianting is the world champion and this year’s standout performer. Olha Kharlan is one of Ukraine’s biggest Olympic names, a four-time world champion in women’s sabre and a four-time Olympic fencing medallist. Kharlan qualified for Paris 2024 in unusual circumstances. She did not shake the hand of Russia’s Anna Smirnova at last year's World Championships, Smirnova protested, and Kharlan was disqualified. The International Olympic Committee stepped in to guarantee Kharlan a place at the Games. The women’s sabre final, which Kharlan will hope to reach, takes place from 20:45. Expert knowledge South Korea are again the dominant force in men’s team archery (medal matches from 15:48), but there is just a chance that Turkey disrupt that this year. Led by Tokyo individual champion Mete Gazoz, Turkey ranked a lowly seventh after the qualifying round at last year’s World Championships but picked off the Netherlands and Japan in back-to-back come-from-behind victories to set up a final with South Korea. They lost, but Turkey coach Goktug Ergin has already proclaimed his team ready to fight for medals. It is the country’s first Olympic appearance in this event for 24 years. This video can not be played Paris Olympics 2024: Team GB swimming team-mates take on painting challenge Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's team final), fencing (women's epee team), judo (women's -63kg, men's -81 kg), rugby sevens (women's), shooting (mixed team 10m air pistol, men's trap), surfing (men's and women's), swimming (women's 100m back, men's 800m free, men's 4x200m free relay), table tennis (mixed doubles), triathlon (men's individual). Highlights Top coaches have described the Paris triathlon course as “insane”. It is, at least, in-Seine. You start from the Pont Alexandre III bridge in view of the Eiffel Tower, swim 1,500m in the Seine – two downstream sections and one upstream – then run up a set of posh steps to start the 40km bike course, which introduced some cobbled stretches into the mix. Lastly, there is a 10km run back along the same course. It promises to be a spectacular and challenging event, even by Olympic triathlon standards, and GB’s Alex Yee will hope to be at the front of the action in the men's event. Yee won Olympic silver in a pulsating Tokyo contest three years ago. Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, who pulled past Yee to win gold that day, is back but has since moved up to Ironman distance then back down again, and it remains to be seen if he will master that transition. The race starts at 07:00. Women’s team gymnastics is one of the Olympics’ worldwide blockbuster events. The United States will expect one of its largest TV audiences of the Games for Simone Biles and compatriots, assuming they qualify for Tuesday’s final, which begins at 17:15. Becky Downie, back in the British team for a third Olympics, is tasked with helping to steer GB towards a podium finish. The women’s team event is intensely competitive right now, and any of six or seven nations could take a medal, with the absence of Russian athletes also opening up the contest. There is lots going on in swimming's evening session. Team GB have a real chance of gold in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay, having won the Olympic title in Tokyo and the world title in 2023. Tom Dean, James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott are all veterans of both victories and are in the line-up. The relay starts at 20:59. The women’s 100m backstroke at 19:57 is expected to feature Australia’s Kaylee McKeown, a three-time champion in Tokyo, against the likes of American Regan Smith and Canada’s Kylie Masse. Brit watch It is day one of dressage. Yes, you did just see dressage a few days ago. That was eventing dressage. This is dressage dressage, where GB have an extremely accomplished team. The event begins at 10:00. Freestyle BMX begins with qualifiers featuring GB’s Kieran Reilly and Charlotte Worthington (12:25 onward). Reilly is the men’s world champion and Worthington is the Olympic champion. In the men’s event, France’s Anthony Jeanjean is an imposing threat to Reilly, particularly having demonstrated he can entertain a home crowd with a World Cup win in Montpellier leading up the Games. Australia’s Logan Martin is defending his Tokyo title. Joe Clarke, who won canoe slalom gold in Rio eight years ago but was left out of the GB team for Tokyo in 2021, is back for Paris and begins his K1 event with the heats from 15:00. Mallory Franklin, the women’s C1 Tokyo silver medallist and world champion, starts her heats at 14:00. GB men's hockey team play the Netherlands, the only team with a better world ranking, in their group at 11:45. Ireland play India at 12:15. Tokyo bronze medallist Matthew Coward-Holley and 2022 world silver medallist Nathan Hales will hope to be in the men’s trap shooting final from 14:30. Coward-Holley comes into the Games ranked third in the world behind Spain’s Alberto Fernandez and Australia’s James Willett. World watch A win on home turf would give France’s Tokyo opening ceremony flagbearer, Clarisse Agbegnenou, a third Olympic judo gold alongside the -63kg and mixed team titles she won three years ago. Lucy Renshall is GB’s representative in the event. Medal contests from 16:49. 3x3 basketball is making its second Olympic appearance after a debut in Tokyo, offering a street version of the game using half a court. Latvia won the first 3x3 Olympic men’s title three years ago and begin their defence against Lithuania (17:35), who proved a surprise package at the 2022 World Championships, getting all the way to the final with victories against teams including France and the US. Surfing presents a dilemma for writers of day-by-day guides: if it starts on Tuesday and goes through the night into Wednesday, where to put it? In case you want to follow the whole thing: the quarter-finals begin at 18:00 on Tuesday, the semi-finals will go past midnight, the men’s gold-medal contest will be at 02:34 on Wednesday and the women’s final will be at 03:15. Remember, this is because the surfing is in Tahiti, which is 12 hours behind France. The US will expect to win the women’s surfing title with the likes of Olympic champion Carissa Moore and world champion Caroline Marks on the team, but watch out for Brazil’s Tatiana Weston-Webb, Costa Rica’s Brisa Hennessy and France’s Vahine Fierro, who used to live in Tahiti and trains there. On the men’s side, Brazil’s Gabriel Medina and US surfer John John Florence are two out of a dozen or more names in with a serious chance of winning. Tahitian Kauli Vaast, surfing for France, is an underdog who could exploit his local knowledge. Women’s rugby sevens reaches the final at 18:45. Will GB improve on fourth place in Tokyo? Can France go one better than last time and clinch gold on home soil? Will New Zealand be all-conquering again, or can Australia get back to their winning ways of 2016? Expert knowledge The Dominican Republic's men's football team, whose squad includes Leeds defender Junior Firpo, are playing fellow Olympic debutants Uzbekistan (14:00). This might be both teams' best shot at a result if tough encounters against Egypt and Spain do not go their way. Something jaw-dropping happened at Tokyo 2020: China failed to win one of the table tennis gold medals. To put this in perspective, China have won 32 of the 37 Olympic table tennis titles ever contested, and the one they missed in Tokyo was the first the country had not won since 2004. To rub salt into that wound, it was a new event, the mixed doubles, where Japan’s Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito pulled off a come-from-behind win over Chinese rivals for gold on home soil. Could China possibly be denied again? Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha are the world number one-ranked duo coming into the Paris 2024 mixed doubles, which concludes with the final at 13:30. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (men's individual all-around), BMX freestyle (men's and women's), canoe slalom (women's C1), diving (women's synchro 10m platform), fencing (men's sabre team), judo (women's-70kg, men's -90kg), rowing (men's quadruple sculls, women's quadruple sculls), shooting (women's trap), swimming (women's 100m free, men's 200m fly, women's 1500m free, men's 200m breast, men's 100m free), triathlon (women's individual). Highlights Wednesday is the women’s turn to take on the Paris triathlon course from 07:00. Team GB have a very strong team in world champion Beth Potter, Tokyo individual silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown and world top 10-ranked Kate Waugh. France’s Cassandre Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi are also contenders for gold at their home Games. The men's all-around gymnastics final begins at 16:30, an event where athletes compete on all six apparatus to decide the best overall gymnast at the Olympics. Max Whitlock made it on to the Rio podium in this event eight years ago, but defending champion and multiple world title-winner Daiki Hashimoto is the favourite. We reach the freestyle BMX finals from 12:10, where GB’s Charlotte Worthington and Kieran Reilly are proven champions on the world stage. This is freestyle’s second Olympic appearance. To win gold, perform as many tricks as you can in 60 seconds and make sure they are better than anyone else’s. Depending on how Tuesday’s heats went, Wednesday could bring a medal opportunity for GB’s Mallory Franklin in the C1 women’s canoe slalom (final from 16:25). Australia’s Jessica Fox, one of the greatest canoeists of all time and the Tokyo champion, will be one of Franklin’s biggest rivals. Watch out for Elena Lilik, who beat Andrea Herzog – Tokyo’s bronze medallist – to claim Germany’s sole entry in this event. Brit watch Rowing’s quadruple sculls finals begin at 11:26. Britain are the world champions in the women’s event and picked up 2022 world silver in the men’s race. In shooting, Lucy Hall, a European silver medallist in 2022, will hope to feature in the women’s trap final at 14:30. Jemima Yeats-Brown lost her sister and biggest fan, Jenny, to brain cancer just after winning Commonwealth judo bronze in 2022. Yeats-Brown says that has helped inspire a “life’s too short” approach to competing that helped her secure fifth at the World Championships in 2023. She fights in the -70kg category, where medal contests start at 16:18. In hockey, GB’s women play South Africa at 09:30. World watch The 100m freestyle contest at the pool (21:15) is a chance to see Caeleb Dressel, regarded as one of the greatest sprinters in US and world swimming, defending his Tokyo title. There is a lot of hype coming into Paris about David Popovici, a superstar of the Romanian team, but he had a tough 2023. This is a chance for Popovici to make an impact after finishing seventh in Tokyo aged just 16, while Matt Richards and Duncan Scott swim for GB. Also watch for Anna Hopkin in the women’s 100m freestyle (19:30), James Wilby in the men’s 200m breaststroke (21:08) and American Katie Ledecky in the women’s 1,500m free (20:04). In men’s basketball the US-South Sudan game (20:00) pits one of the most dominant teams in Olympic history against a first-time entrant. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011 and its basketball federation joined world governing body Fiba in 2013, so getting to the Olympics about a decade later is pretty good going, to put it mildly. At the heart of that story? Luol Deng, who played basketball for GB at London 2012. Deng, who spent a decade playing for the NBA’s Chicago Bulls, holds British and South Sudanese citizenship. For years as a coach, he has been a driving force (and financial force) behind the South Sudan team’s rise to Olympic status. Facing the US in Paris may be the pinnacle of that incredible story arc. Expert knowledge  Lois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix come into Paris 2024 as history-makers before they even start their first dive. The duo won world silver last year, the first time Britain had won any women’s diving medal at that level. If they win another medal here – the women’s 10m synchro diving final starts at 10:00 – watch for some cartwheels on the BBC studio sofa, as Andrea’s dad is Fred Sirieix, star of First Dates turned BBC presenter at Paris 2024. Gold medal events: Artistic gymnastics (women's individual all-around), athletics (men's and women's 20km race walk), canoe slalom (men K1), fencing (women's foil team), judo (women's -78kg, men's -100kg), rowing (women's double sculls, men's double sculls, women's coxless four, men's coxless four), sailing (men's and women's skiff), shooting (men's 50m rifle 3 positions) and swimming (women's 200m fly, men's 200m back, women's 200m breast, women's 4x200m free relay). Highlights British rowers are used to heaps of gold medals – more than 30 of them in Olympic rowing. GB were the top rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Then came Tokyo and not one gold. They were 14th in the rowing medal table, which was a shock. Thursday might be the day we know if the Brits are turning that ship around. Helen Glover will hope to lead an impressive women’s four in the final at 10:50, while the men’s four won the world title in both 2022 and 2023. Their final is at 11:10. The space of about half an hour could play a huge role in deciding if this Olympic regatta is a GB return to form. The rowers are not the only ones who had a Tokyo to forget. Joe Clarke did not make the team despite being the defending Olympic champion in K1 slalom canoeing. Now, he is back and will hope to be a big factor in the Paris final from 16:30. The women’s all-around gymnastics final at 17:15 could see some remarkable history being made. If they are both healthy and nominated for this event, American duo Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee could make this the first women’s all-around final in which the past two Olympic champions have competed. Biles won in 2016, followed by Lee in 2020. If either of them wins gold, they will be the first woman to win multiple Olympic all-around titles since Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968. Brit watch Golf found its way back on to the Olympic schedule in 2016 after more than a century in the wilderness (or perhaps deep rough). At Paris 2024, the course is L’Albatros at Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2018. The first round of the men’s event starts at 08:00 and features GB’s Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood, Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and a host of the sport’s other big names. Luke Greenbank will hope to better his Tokyo bronze medal in the men’s 200m backstroke (19:37) at the pool. Meanwhile, Team GB have been top-four material of late in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay so could pose a medal threat there too (20:48). Beth Shriever has remained dominant in BMX racing since winning Olympic gold in Tokyo. However, she fractured her collarbone at the sport’s World Championships in May, meaning one of GB’s big medal hopes has faced a race against time. From 19:20 we will see how that comeback has progressed as the early stages of her event take place. In the men’s event, Olympic and world silver medallist Kye Whyte is returning from a back injury of his own. In hockey, GB’s men take on hosts France at 11:45, Ireland’s men play Argentina at 12:15 and GB’s women face the US at 16:00. Showjumping begins with the team qualifier from 10:00. Scott Brash and Ben Maher, who were part of Britain’s gold medal-winning team at London 2012, are joined this time around by Harry Charles. World watch Back at the pool, Katie Ledecky may have a shot at some Olympic history by this point in the Games. If she has won two medals by this point – very possible, given the 200m free and 400m free will have been and gone, and she has won golds in both in the past – then a medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay (20:48) would be her 13th overall, a record for a US female Olympian. (Three American women, all of them swimmers, have previously reached 12: Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin.) The men’s and women’s 20km race walks begin at 06:30 and 08:20 respectively. Chinese veteran Liu Hong, the 2016 women’s champion, is trying to end a run of five years – ages, by her standards – without a major title. Spain’s Maria Perez is the world champion, having been on the brink of quitting the sport in 2022 after back-to-back disqualifications at that year’s European and world championships. Another Spanish athlete, Alvaro Martin, is the men’s world champion. At Roland Garros, we reach the first tennis semi-finals from 11:00. Expert knowledge The first sailing medals of the Games will be awarded in the skiff class. For the men, this means the 49er, and for the women it is the 49er FX (a version designed to work with a lighter two-person crew than the 49er). Saskia Tidey is at her third Olympics and representing her second country in sailing.  Tidey sailed for Ireland in 2016, then switched to GB for Tokyo once it became apparent that she had no suitable Irish partner available in the two-person event. Tidey and GB team-mate Charlotte Dobson finished sixth three years ago, and now Tidey is back with new partner Freya Black. The two were European bronze medallists in May. GB’s James Peters and Fynn Sterritt, in the men’s event, said before the Games they had been trying to put on weight after realising they were one of the lighter boats in the men’s fleet. Britain are the defending champions in this event after Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell won gold three years ago.  Gold medal events: Archery (mixed team), athletics (men's 10,000m), badminton (mixed doubles), BMX racing (men's and women's), diving (men's synchro 3m springboard), equestrian (jumping team), fencing (men's epee team), judo (women's +78kg, men's +100kg), rowing (men's coxless pair, women's coxless pair, men's lightweight double sculls, women's lightweight double sculls), sailing (men's and women's windsurfing), shooting (women's 50m rifle 3 positions), swimming (men's 50m free, women's 200m back, men's 200m individual medley), tennis (mixed doubles), trampoline gymnastics (women's and men's). Highlights Keely Hodgkinson, tipped to be one of Team GB’s biggest stars in Paris, appears for the first time in the 800m heats from 18:45. The 22-year-old is hoping to upgrade Tokyo silver to gold in 2024. Earlier, Dina Asher-Smith will be in the opening stages of the women’s 100m from 10:50. She, like Hodgkinson, won the European title in her event last month. Jack Laugher will dive with his third different partner in as many Olympics when he competes in the men’s 3m synchro diving from 10:00. Anthony Harding is Laugher’s team-mate this time. They have won two world silver medals together, each time behind China. Laugher won this event with Chris Mears at Rio 2016. It is BMX racing finals day. If Beth Shriever and Kye Whyte have recovered from pre-Games injuries and are still in the running, they will have to negotiate the semi-finals before the gold-medal races from 20:35. Both riders are in the world’s top six. France have a trio of highly rated riders on the men’s side, while Australia’s Saya Sakakibara is seeking redemption in the women’s event after a semi-final crash in Tokyo. Bryony Page stunned the field when she took the first Olympic trampoline medal in Britain’s history, silver in 2016. She added bronze in Tokyo and has won two of the past three world titles, setting up one another bid for gold aged 33 before she pursues her dream of joining the acrobats at Cirque du Soleil. Qualifying is at 11:00 before the final at 12:50. Lightweight scullers Emily Craig and Imogen Grant missed a medal in the women’s lightweight double sculls by 0.01 seconds in Tokyo. Since then, they have won back-to-back world titles and are considered one of the British rowing team’s best hopes for gold in Paris. The final takes place at 11:22. In sailing, windsurfing reaches its final day. This year’s windsurfing event involves a new class, iQFoil, which replaces the old RS:X class. The way the IOC explains the difference is that “instead of floating, the board appears to fly” in the iQFoil class because of hydrofoils that lift the board out of the water at certain speeds. Emma Wilson, who won RS:X bronze in Tokyo, has world silver and bronze medals in iQFoil and will hope to be going for a podium place on Friday. Brit watch Swimming on Friday features GB’s Ben Proud versus American Caeleb Dressel in the men’s 50m freestyle (final at 19:30). Dressel is the Tokyo Olympic champion, while Proud has a gold and two bronzes from the past three World Championships. Australia’s Cameron McEvoy will also be hoping for a medal. In shooting, world number one Seonaid McIntosh takes aim in the women’s 50m rifle three positions from 08:30. The “three positions” part means you shoot kneeling, prone (lying down) and standing. Friday’s equestrian highlight is the team jumping final at 13:00, featuring a British team who took world bronze behind Sweden and the Netherlands in 2022. In hockey, Ireland’s men play New Zealand at 16:00, followed by GB against Germany at 19:15. World watch Returning to the pool, the men’s 200m individual medley (19:49) offers an opportunity for French swimming star Leon Marchand to try to surpass Ryan Lochte’s world record time. Lochte’s record is one minute 54.00 seconds, while Marchand got down to 1:54.82 in winning world gold ahead of GB’s Duncan Scott and Tom Dean last year. Tokyo silver medallist Scott and Dean will hope to make the Paris final, while Tokyo champion Wang Shun of China is back. In the men's 50m freestyle, France will be cheering for Florent Manaudou, London 2012 gold medallist in the event and one of the hosts’ two flagbearers at the opening ceremony. Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei has dominated the men’s 10,000m but was beaten by Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega in an extraordinarily humid Tokyo 2020 final. Both are back for 2024 and this is the only title on offer during the opening night of athletics (20:20). Badminton’s mixed doubles final (15:10) is highly likely to have at least one Chinese entry and it would be no surprise if, like Tokyo, the final was between two Chinese teams. Three years ago, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong were defeated by Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping. Gold medallist Wang has since retired, so silver medallists Zheng and Huang Yaqiong may end up facing Huang Dongping and new partner Feng Yanzhe this time around. Archery’s mixed team final takes place from 15:43. In Tokyo, an arrow from South Korea’s An San hit and split an arrow shot by team-mate Kim Je-deok on their way to gold in this event. This is almost impossible to achieve and is known as a “Robin Hood arrow”. According to World Archery, this may have been the first time a Robin Hood arrow was ever filmed in competition. The two arrows are now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Tennis reaches the mixed doubles final and men’s singles semi-finals (11:00-20:00). The men’s football quarter-finals take place in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux with kick-offs between 14:00 and 20:00. In women’s 3x3 basketball, two of the world’s top-ranked nations – France and the US – meet at 12:00. Expert knowledge Teddy Riner will try to equal the Olympic judo record for three individual gold medals in front of his home crowd. The 100+kg event’s medal rounds begin at 16:49. Riner is virtually unbeatable. Between September 2010 and February 2020, he won 154 consecutive contests. At the Tokyo Olympics, he had to settle for bronze after losing to Russia’s Tamerlan Bashaev, his first defeat at the Games since 2008. He has not lost at Grand Slam or World Championship level since Tokyo. Gold medal events: Archery (women's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's floor, women's vault, men's pommel horse finals), athletics (men's shot put, women's triple jump, mixed 4x400m relay, women's 100m, men's decathlon), badminton (women's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix special team), fencing (women's sabre team), judo (mixed team), road cycling (men's road race), rowing (women's single sculls, men's single sculls, women's eight, men's eight), shooting (women's 25m pistol, men's skeet), swimming (men's 100m fly, women's 200m individual medley, women's 800m free, mixed 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (women's singles), tennis (women's singles, men's doubles). Highlights Britain’s fastest female sprinter, Dina Asher-Smith, will hope to line up in the 100m final at 20:20. Asher-Smith has changed coach and moved to train in Texas since a disappointing eighth place in last year’s world final. “I want to win the Olympics and I want to run really fast,” she has said. Big rivals include US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson and Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson. Richardson has the year’s leading mark of 10.71 seconds. At 16:10, the pommel horse final is Max Whitlock’s chance to deliver on his aim of an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus. Ireland’s world champion and pommel horse specialist Rhys McClenaghan will have his sights on gold. The women’s vault final (15:20) may feature Simone Biles, the Rio 2016 champion, returning to an event from which she withdrew in Tokyo. This is the last day of rowing and the very last final on the list is the men’s eight (10:10). Britain won this event in 2016 but New Zealand were the winners in Tokyo. GB have recovered to win the past two world titles. Defending champions Canada, Romania and the US are contenders in the women’s eight (09:50). Dressage’s team event concludes from 09:00. GB have not been off the Olympic podium since a memorable victory at London 2012, but can they get back to the top step? Brit watch It is the penultimate night at the pool. GB smashed the world record to win the mixed 4x100m medley relay (20:33) when it was held for the first time at the Tokyo Games. This is a great relay to watch as there is a heap of strategy involved in looking at your team’s strengths and weaknesses, then deciding who you put on which leg. It is often not clear which team’s plan is paying off until the final moments. Cycling returns with the men’s road race (10:00). GB have qualified a full four-man team that features Tom Pidcock, who only just competed in Olympic mountain-biking last week, never mind half of the Tour de France before dropping out with Covid. The course reaches a climax with three laps of cobbled climb before a downhill stretch and a sprint towards the Trocadero. Kayak cross is new at the Olympics. If you have seen snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics then – yes, that, except in whitewater. Instead of the usual Olympic slalom canoeing against the clock, paddlers race each other to the finish. They have to turn around in whitewater, flip their boats and perform all sorts of other manoeuvres along the way. The opening rounds begin at 14:30 and Team GB have some of the world’s best athletes. Saturday’s hockey includes GB’s women versus Argentina at 09:00. World watch Serena Williams, Monica Puig and Belinda Bencic are your last three women’s singles tennis champions at the Olympics. Who will it be this time? World number one Iga Swiatek has Olympic success in her blood – her dad, Tomasz Swiatek, was a rower for Poland at Seoul 1988. The hosts will pin their hopes on Caroline Garcia making it this far. This is also the day of the men’s doubles final, an event that includes Andy Murray and Dan Evans plus Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski for GB. Elsewhere in the night’s swimming action, Katie Ledecky has a shot at a fourth consecutive gold in the women’s 800m freestyle (20:09). It could be close, though. Last time, in Tokyo, Ariarne Titmus was just a second behind her – the first time anyone had been within four seconds of Ledecky in an Olympic final over this distance. On the track, the men’s 100m first round (from 10:45) allows us a first look at world champion Noah Lyles and Christian Coleman, both representing the US, as well as GB trio Zharnel Hughes, Louie Hinchliffe and Jeremiah Azu. Keep an eye out for “Africa’s fastest man” Ferdinand Omanyala of Kenya and Jamaican title challenger Kishane Thompson. The decathlon concludes with the 1500m race at 20:45. France’s Kevin Mayer, a silver medallist in Tokyo and Rio, will be trying to upgrade that on home soil, although team-mate Makenson Gletty comes in with a better world ranking. Canada, boasting Olympic champion Damian Warner and world champion Pierce LePage, will be tough to beat. Badminton’s women’s doubles is a big target for Indonesia. Apriyani Rahayu won Tokyo gold with Greysia Polii and is now paired with Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti after Polii’s retirement. China’s Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan are the favourites. The two teams meet each other in the group stages, which may help set the scene for Saturday’s final (15:10). Women football reaches the quarter-final stage with games kicking off at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 20:00. Expert knowledge  Ledecky is not the only athlete capable of racking up a fourth gold medal in an event on Saturday. Skeet shooter Vincent Hancock won gold in Beijing, London and Tokyo for the US, a remarkable record marred only by finishing 15th in Rio. This time around, Hancock is coming in ranked 17th in the world. As of the start of Saturday, only six people have won the same individual event four times at the Olympics: Denmark’s Paul Elvstrom in sailing, Americans Al Oerter and Carl Lewis in athletics, Japan’s Kaori Icho and Cuba’s Mijain Lopez in wrestling, and Michael Phelps for the US in swimming. Nobody has ever won the same individual event five times at the Olympics (although it could happen in Paris – see Tuesday, 6 August). Ledecky at LA 2028, anyone? Olympic Games fan zones to be set up across the UK Olympics 2024: how extreme weather could impact Paris games Gold medal events: Archery (men's individual), artistic gymnastics (men's rings, women's uneven bars, men's vault), athletics (women's high jump, men's hammer throw, men's 100m), badminton (men's doubles), equestrian (dressage grand prix freestyle individual), fencing (men's foil team), golf (men's round 4), road cycling (women's road race), shooting (women's skeet), swimming (women's 50m free, men's 1500m free, men's 4x100m medley relay, women's 4x100m medley relay), table tennis (men's singles), tennis (women's doubles and men's singles). Highlights Sunday at 20:55 is go time for the men’s 100m final. Will Zharnel Hughes be on the start line for GB after a world bronze last year? Will Noah Lyles become the first American to win this event since 2004? Can Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo pull off an upgrade on last year’s world silver? Roland Garros hosts the Olympic men’s singles final. Many fans would love a Nadal-Djokovic Olympic final on clay here. They have met once before at the Games, in the Beijing 2008 semi-finals, which Nadal won. Realistically, the Spaniard may have a better chance of a medal in the doubles. Serbia's Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to win the one big title still missing from his collection. The final round of the men’s golf competition begins at 08:00. American Xander Schauffele will be in Paris to defend his title, and he has said an Olympic gold medal is proving increasingly valuable in a sport that, until Rio 2016, was all about its four majors. Spain’s Jon Rahm will be one of the highest-profile LIV Golf players at the Games. Lizzie Deignan is the first female British cyclist to be selected for four Olympic Games. Deignan – the London 2012 silver medallist and 2015 world champion – is joined by national champion Pfeiffer Georgi, Anna Henderson and Anna Morris for Sunday’s women’s road race, which starts at 13:00. A strong Dutch team for this race features Ellen van Dijk, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes and Marianne Vos, who won gold in London 12 years ago. Brit watch With Charlotte Dujardin pulling out on Tuesday, team-mate Lottie Fry - daughter of Laura, who rode at Barcelona 1992 – could be one of the biggest challengers in this event. In gymnastics, Jake Jarman won world vault gold last year and backed it up with a European title in April. The 22-year-old has the chance to turn that form into an Olympic title at 15:25. Becky Downie could be a contender in the uneven bars from 14:40. Amber Rutter welcomed her first child to the world in April. Now she’s shooting for skeet gold at Paris 2024 (qualification from 08:30, final from 14:30). Rutter missed Tokyo 2020 through a positive Covid test just before she travelled, which she says was devastating at the time but ultimately helped reshape her life goals to include both personal priorities and Olympic aims. In track and field action, world silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith is in the opening round of the men’s 400m from 18:05. Men’s hockey reaches the quarter-final stages. World watch The first round of the men’s 110m hurdles begins at 10:50. Grant Holloway was the Tokyo favourite until he “lost composure” in his words and allowed Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment to thunder past. Holloway has since won both available world titles and is on the US team for Paris. In the women’s 400m hurdles first round (11:35) watch for another American, defending champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, testing herself against Dutch world champion Femke Bol. The last night of swimming at Paris 2024 (from 17:30) features four finals: the women’s 50m free, men’s 1,500m free, men’s 4x100m medley and women’s 4x100m medley. Sweden’s Sarah Sjostrom is a big contender in the women’s 50m free, while the women’s 4x100m medley could turn into a classic US-Australia battle. GB won men’s medley silver in Tokyo. The table tennis men’s singles final could be an opportunity for China’s Ma Long to extend an extraordinary Olympic streak (13:30). Ma comes into the Games having won all five Olympic titles available to him since 2012 – three team, two individual. Expert knowledge We are well into the quarter-finals and semi-finals of boxing’s various weights. In the women’s middleweight division (75kg), where quarter-finals take place on Sunday, UK-based Cindy Ngamba is fighting for the Olympic Refugee Team. Ngamba is unable to return to Cameroon, where she was born, because of her sexuality – homosexuality in the country is punishable with up to five years in prison. She is the first boxer ever selected for an Olympic refugee team. Fencing at Paris 2024 concludes with men’s team foil (19:30), a perfect finale for the hosts, who are the defending champions. To score a point, you need to strike your opponent on their torso, shoulder or neck with the tip of your weapon. You also need to have “right of way” which, if you’re new to fencing, is a concept best left to the referee, who decides which fencer has attacking priority at any given time. In the team event, everyone cycles through a series of mini head-to-head match-ups until one team scores 45. Alternatively, the highest-scoring team wins if the ninth and final bout ends without either team reaching 45.

701,Canada send two staff members home over drone incident,"British coach Beverly Priestman is manager of Canada's women's team, who won gold in Tokyo in 2021 Canada women's football manager Beverly Priestman will not take charge of her side's Olympics opener against New Zealand after two members of her backroom staff were sent home for allegedly flying a drone over the Kiwis' team training session.  Priestman, 38, has ""voluntarily withdrawn"" from Thursday's match in St Etienne after the New Zealand Olympic Committee reported that a drone had been flown over their training session on Monday.  Jasmine Mander, Priestman's assistant, has been sent home along with ""unaccredited analyst"" Joseph Lombardi. Fifa said it has opened disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi and Mander. The Canadian Olympic Committee say a scouting report filed by Lombardi was sent to Mander.  Priestman says she takes responsibility for the actions of her colleagues.  ""I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada. This does not represent the values that our team stands for,” Priestman said.  “I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.""  The COC confirmed on Wednesday that a ""non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team"" was detained by authorities.  ""The Canadian Olympic Committee stands for fair play and we are shocked and disappointed,"" it added in a statement., external ""We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee."" The NZOC said it has ""formally lodged the incident with the IOC integrity unit and has asked Canada for a full review"".

700,What to expect from an Olympic ceremony like no other,"The opening ceremony will signal the official start of the 2024 Paris Olympics  The opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics promises to be an event like no other. In a first for the Games, the spectacle will not be in a stadium, instead taking place on Paris' famous River Seine. Here is all you need to know about the ceremony... When do the Olympics start? How City of Light changed the Olympics The eye-catching ceremony will take place across a 6km route along the Seine. It will begin at Austerlitz bridge and end among the gardens, fountains and palaces in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at Trocadero.   There will be almost 100 boats carrying more than 10,000 athletes, plus a host of dignitaries, which sail past Paris' iconic landmarks, including Notre Dame cathedral and Pont Neuf. The boats will transport the athletes in the parade but also be used in the artistic part of the ceremony, which will showcase the history and culture of Paris and France. The identity of the performers, though, has been kept a tight secret.  Thousands of people are still expected to line the river and the streets with millions more watching on television around the world. ""I’d like to show France in all its diversity,"" said Thomas Jolly, the French actor and theatre director named as the ceremony's artistic director - the role performed by Danny Boyle at London 2012. ""Illustrate the richness and plurality shaped by its history, which has been influenced and inspired by the diverse cultures that have passed through it, while itself serving as a source of inspiration."" The ceremony will also include the official opening of the Games, carried out by France president Emmanuel Macron, and the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. Again, many of the finer details have been kept as a surprise. Seating for spectators has been set up along the Seine for the ceremony The ceremony begins at 19:30 local time (18:30 BST) on Friday, 26 July. It is expected to last just under four hours, with the final stages taking place as the sun sets across the French capital.  Thankfully, the Paris weather forecast for Friday evening is good. Keeping with tradition, Greece will be the first nation introduced during the ceremony.  NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of their flagbearers for the Games. Greece will then be followed by the Refugee Olympic Team, while hosts France will be the last to be introduced.  Those athletes from Russia and Belarus competing as individuals because of their countries' role in the war in Ukraine will not take part. The opening ceremony will be shown live from 17:45 BST on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will be radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds from 19:00 BST. There will also be live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app bringing you the best of the event from Paris.",2024-07-24 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c728e504xego,Unknown,2024-07-24 23:10:54,
699,Morocco beat Argentina in game marred by crowd trouble,"This video can not be played Watch the story of Argentina's game against Morocco that lasted four hours Crowd trouble forced the first football match of the Olympics to be suspended for nearly two hours amid chaotic and worrying scenes, with the game eventually completed in an empty stadium. Morocco had been 2-0 ahead against Argentina, who pulled a goal back and were pushing for an equaliser. Cristian Medina then appeared to have made it 2-2 in the 16th of what had been 15 scheduled minutes of injury time at the end of the second half. After the resulting crowd trouble, play finally resumed after a lengthy delay with no fans present, and with VAR having ruled out Argentina's equaliser, Morocco secured a controversial 2-1 victory. A number of bottles and cups were thrown at the celebrating players after Argentina's second goal, which was later disallowed Fans had to leave the stadium after the crowd trouble Here's how the chaos and confusion unfolded...  Immediately after Medina looked to have made it 2-2, a number of cups and bottles were then thrown at the celebrating Argentina side before what appeared to be a flare landed near the players and coaching staff. A number of fans in Morocco colours also ran on to the pitch, with some being escorted off the pitch by stewards. Riot police moved to the side of the pitch and the referee immediately took the players off the pitch. The fans inside the stadium in Saint Etienne were told to leave the ground and a message on a big screen said: ""Your session has been suspended please make your way to the nearest exit."" It was unclear whether the match had been classed as finished, but it was then revealed the final three minutes would be played in an empty stadium with no fans present. Before the match could be played to a finish, it was announced that Argentina's potential equaliser had actually been ruled out by a video assistant referee decision that showed a player was offside before Medina scored. 'Circus' football opener 'pathetic' - Mascherano This video can not be played Late goal sends Argentina v Morocco game into chaos Referee Glenn Nyberg gestures after VAR disallowed Argentina's second goal The players had gone off the pitch at 16:05 BST, and they then came back to warm up at 17:45 before the match could resume at 18:00. Immediately the referee checked to see if the 'equaliser' should stand via a pitchside monitor and, as expected, the 'goal' was disallowed. Play resumed just after 18:00 for the last three minutes, and with neither side scoring further, Morocco won the match 2-1. Both Morocco goals were scored by Soufiane Rahimi, one just before half-time and then a penalty early in the second half as they looked to begin their 2024 gold-medal bid with a win. Argentina pulled a goal back through Giuliano Simeone, the son of Atletico Madrid manager and former Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone. But, after all the drama, it was Morocco who took the three points. Argentina won the men's Olympic football tournament in 2004 and 2008 and ex-Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano, who was a part of the winning squad for the second of those successes, is managing the team in 2024. Mascherano's side will now need to get positive results against Iraq on Saturday and Ukraine on Tuesday to have a chance of finishing in the top two in the group and advancing to the quarter-finals. A statement from the tournament organisers said: ""The football match between Argentina and Morocco at the Saint-Etienne Stadium was suspended due to a pitch invasion by a small number of spectators.  ""The match then restarted and was able to conclude safely. Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions.""

698,Lammy aims to reset UK-India ties with early trip,"India can be tricky territory for Labour.  Prime Minister Clement Attlee was criticised for allowing partition to be rushed at terrible cost in human life.  Foreign Secretary Robin Cook caused a storm by offering to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And the party led by Jeremy Corbyn angered even more here when it passed a motion calling for international intervention in the disputed region. So it must have been with some trepidation that David Lammy arrived in a warm and damp New Delhi on Wednesday morning, a newly-minted foreign secretary stepping away for the first time from the more familiar turf of Europe and the United States.  His trip oozed caution. The announcements were uncontroversial; both countries agreed a new tech security partnership.  His words in interviews were safe and measured, eulogising India as a “superpower” and “indispensable partner”.  Mr Lammy’s programme even included a tree planting ceremony at the British residence. Radical this was not. Yet the nature of the trip was less important than the sheer fact of it.  This was a British foreign secretary in a new government, making a point of visiting India in his third week in office.  Mr Lammy held talks with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. More than that, he also secured a prized meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a head of government who rarely deigns to trouble himself with mere foreign ministers.  And all this while Mr Modi’s new coalition government was busy dealing with the fallout from its first budget. In other words, this was a meeting both sides wanted and were prepared to make time for.  For Labour, the primary focus was trade. If it wants the UK's economy to grow, then it will need British firms to do more business with Indian partners.  India’s economy is on course to become the world’s third largest by the end of the decade. Yet it is only the UK's 12th largest trading partner. “There is so much we can do with this global superpower,” Mr Lammy told me.  “We have a long-standing history, a longstanding relationship, and it is a win-win for both of our economies.”  He said Britain would work with India to agree a new free trade deal “in the coming months”, negotiations that have been stalled for much of the year as both countries held elections. “Being here in India is essential. We have shared interest with India. It is a growing economy. It is going to be the third largest by the end of this decade. It is hugely important that we deepen and grow our ties.” But this trip was not just about economics. There was broader geopolitics too.  Mr Lammy wants to reset Britain’s relations with the so-called Global South. India sees itself as key player in this loose group of developing nations.  And that, Mr Lammy says, involves less lecturing by Britain and more listening.  He was keen to talk about shared interests on green technology and shared threats in the Indo-Pacific, namely China.  He was less keen to talk about his hosts subsidising Russia’s war machine in Ukraine by buying many tanker loads of cheap Russian oil and gas.  “Across the democratic community, there will always be differences of opinion,” he averred. Which is one way of excusing an ally for aiding an enemy. The subtext to all this - implicit rather than explicit - was that with so much political instability among Britain’s traditional allies on both sides of the Atlantic, the government was keen to revive and reset – to use Mr Lammy’s favoured phrase – its relations with other allies. And India is the biggest prize. He said Britain’s relationship with India had been “underperforming” but both countries’ interests were aligned on many issues. He said the UK must cooperate with India “in this tough, geopolitically-challenging time”. For Indian ministers, Mr Lammy’s trip was seen as good moment to invest in a British government that may be in power for some time.  It was also a chance to refocus the UK on the possibility of a trade deal between the two countries - which India hopes would force the UK to relax its visa regime for Indian students and business professionals. They clearly welcomed the fact Mr Lammy had made an early visit, and had brought a plane-load of tech entrepreneurs with him. Away from the economics, there was also some unstated politics.  India has just lost in Rishi Sunak a British prime minister of Asian origin with close family links to the country.  Labour was aware of that, and wanted to fill the gap quickly.  The Jeremy Corbyn era is also still fresh is some Indian minds, and Mr Lammy’s early trip will come as some reassurance. This trip to the subcontinent was hot and humid. Mr Lammy’s suit was too dark and thick. But the great-grandson of a lady from Calcutta will probably think it was worth the sweat in diplomatic gain.

697,Biden to tell US it's time to 'pass the torch' to Harris,"US President Joe Biden will tell Americans it's time to ""pass the torch to a new generation"" in a televised address from the White House explaining his historic decision to step aside as the Democratic candidate in this November's election. The Oval Office speech will be his first public remarks since the 21 July announcement, which paved the way for Vice-President Kamala Harris to run as the party's nominee instead. The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, meanwhile, said at a rally that Ms Harris was a ""radical left lunatic"".  Opinion polls so far indicate a tight race between the former president and Ms Harris in a hypothetical match-up. Mr Biden is also expected to lay out his plans to ""finish the job for the American people"" before the end of his term in January next year. Ms Harris, who earlier this week secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates, has already received an endorsement from the current president. In the first 36 hours after Sunday's announcement that he was quitting the race, the fledgling Harris campaign raised more than $100 (£77m) - a record-breaking sum. Mr Biden is due to speak at 20:00 local time (01:00 BST) on Wednesday. Excerpts of his speech show that Mr Biden will argue that ""the defence of democracy is more important than any title"". “I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people,” he will say. “But this sacred task of protecting our union is not about me. It’s about you. Your families. Your futures. It’s about ‘we the people’.” Mr Biden will also outline his remaining months as president, vowing to remain “focused on doing my job” and fighting what he sees as threats to democracy. “That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy,” he will say. “I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.” “The great thing is America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do,” he will say. “History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.” The 81-year-old's decision has upended an already dramatic race for the White House. His exit followed weeks of pressure from top Democrats and donors in the wake of his disastrous performance against the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump late last month. Speaking at his own rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump attacked both Ms Harris and Mr Biden, whom he called the most damaging president in US history.  ""For three-and-a-half years lying Kamala Harris has been the ultraliberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,"" he said. “She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office."" Speaking at a news briefing at the White House earlier in the day, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Mr Biden was ""proud"" of his decision to withdraw, which she said showed him to be ""honorable"". Ms Jean-Pierre added that Mr Biden's choice was ""not about his health"", but declined to give further details. She also told reporters Mr Biden would be “absolutely” capable of finishing his term and serving another, and she denied there was any ""cover-up"" surrounding his cognitive faculties. Many top Democrats praised Mr Biden's decision to step away from the race, including his former boss, Barack Obama. ""Joe Biden has been one of America's most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me,"" Mr Obama said in a statement. ""We've also been reminded - again - that he's a patriot of the highest order."" Ms Harris, for her part, has already begun campaigning. On Tuesday, she addressed a crowd of about 3,000 in a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She lauded Mr Biden's decades-long ""legacy of accomplishment"", adding that it has ""been one of the great honours of my life"" to serve under him. ""In one term... he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who served two terms in office,"" she said. ""I know we are all deeply, deeply grateful for his continuing service to our nation."" Some Republicans have called for Mr Biden to step down as president, arguing that he cannot run the country if he cannot run for office. Mr Biden has vowed to stay in the White House until the end of his term. On Thursday, Mr Biden is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, as well as with the families of US hostages still being held in Gaza.",2024-07-24 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047281jj8do,Unknown,Unknown,
696,Pilot survived Nepal crash after cockpit split from plane,"The pilot who survived a deadly plane crash in Nepal was saved after his cockpit was sheared off by a freight container seconds before the rest of the aircraft crashed in flames. Captain Manish Ratna Shakya, the sole survivor of the disaster that killed 18 people at Kathmandu airport, is being treated in hospital but BBC Nepali has confirmed he is talking and able to tell family members he was “all good”. Rescuers told the BBC that they had reached the stricken pilot as flames neared the cockpit section of the aircraft embedded in the container. “He was facing difficulty to breathe as the air shield was open. We broke the window and immediately pulled him out,” Senior Superintendent of Nepal Police Dambar Bishwakarma said. ""He had blood all over his face when he was rescued but we took him to the hospital in a condition where he could speak,” he added. Nepal's civil aviation minister Badri Pandey described how the aircraft had suddenly turned right as it took off from the airport, before crashing into the east side of the runway. CCTV footage shows the aircraft in flames careering across part of the airport before part of it appears to fall into a valley at the far edge of the site.  ""It hit the container on the edge of the airport... then, it fell further below,"" Mr Pandey said. ""The cockpit, however, remained stuck inside the container. This is how the captain survived.” “The other part of the plane crashed into a nearby mound and it tore into pieces. The entire area away from the region where the cockpit fell down caught fire and everything was burnt,” Mr Pandey said. The pilot was ""rescued within five minutes of the crash"" and ""was very scared but had not lost consciousness at that time"", according to a statement released by the Nepali army. An army ambulance then took him to hospital. According to the hospital's medical director, Dr. Meena Thapa, he suffered injuries to his head and face and will soon undergo surgery to treat broken bones in his back.  ""We have treated injuries on various parts of his body,"" Thapa told BBC News Nepali, ""He is under observation in the neuro surgery ward.""  On Wednesday evening, Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma visited the hospital, where he met members of the pilot's family. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash.  The head of Tribhuvan International Airport said that an initial assessment showed that the plane had flown in the wrong direction. ""As soon as it took off, it turned right, [when it] should have turned left,"" Mr Niraula told BBC Nepali. Nepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record. In January 2023, at least 72 people were killed in a Yeti Airlines crash that was later attributed to its pilots mistakenly cutting the power. It was the deadliest air crash in Nepal since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu Airport. Saruya Airlines operates flights to five destinations within Nepal, with a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets, according to the company’s website.",2024-07-24 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxw21rj7elro,Unknown,Unknown,
695,Graphic footage shows US officers standing over body of Trump gunman,"Bodycam footage captured shortly after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump shows Secret Service and local law enforcement officers near the lifeless body of the gunman. A trail of blood can be seen near the body of the deceased gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was able to fire at the former president from a roof overlooking the outdoor rally in Pennsylvania 10 days ago. One audience member, Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed and two others - David Dutch, 57 and James Copenhaver, 57 - were badly wounded but are in a stable condition. The new footage emerged hours after US Secret Service director Kim Cheatle resigned over security failures surrounding the assassination attempt. The bodycam video captured by Butler County Emergency Services Unit was posted on X by the office of Republican Senator Chuck Grassley. ""A Beaver County sniper seen and sent the pictures out, this is him,"" one Secret Service agent can be heard saying in the video, referring to the shooter's body. ""I don't know if you got the same ones I did?"" an officer asks the agent of the photos. ""I think I did, yeah, he's [the shooter] got his glasses on,"" the agent replies. The officer adds the sniper ""sent the original pictures, and seen him (the shooter) come from the bike, and set the book bag down, and then lost sight of him"".  The agent also asks about whether an abandoned bike that was found in the area belonged to the shooter. ""We don't know,"" an officer replies. Discussions can also be heard about ""victims in the crowd"" and ""people detained who were filming"". Senator Grassley is one of many members of Congress demanding a full investigation into the incident. Lawmakers questioned Ms Cheatle about security preparations ahead of the campaign rally during a six-hour House of Representatives Oversight Committee hearing on Monday. Ms Cheatle said she took responsibility for the security lapses, but during the hearing she pushed back on calls to resign. She called the shooting ""the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades"". Witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man - suspect Crooks - with a rifle on a rooftop at the rally minutes before shots were fired. Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper shortly after getting a volley of shots off. Trump was injured in the right ear. He later said he felt the bullet ""ripping through the skin"". Blood was visible on Trump's face as protection officers rushed him away. On Tuesday night, Ms Cheatle resigned in a letter sent to staff saying as director she took ""full responsibility for the security lapses"".

694,Frantic digging at scene of deadly Ethiopia landslides,"At the scene Ethiopia’s deadliest landslides men are still digging through mounds of mud with their bare hands, spades and pick axes to find those missing - their efforts punctuated by the wails of women and children mourning the 229 people whose bodies have so far been found. They are victims of a cruel act of nature: on Sunday, heavy rains caused a landslide in a village perched high on a mountain in the remote Gofa zone. With four homes engulfed by the landslide, nearby villagers and police officers came in large numbers to dig through the mud in the hope of finding the occupants alive, while women and children looked on, praying and consoling each other. The search continued on Monday, only for a second landslide to occur, burying hundreds of people - no-one knows exactly how many - under the mud. When I arrived in Gofa, in the south-west of Ethiopia, late on Wednesday, between 100 and 200 mostly young men, were still digging as relatives sat nearby, hoping for the best. The diggers had no earth-moving equipment - nothing has been flown in so far and it is impossible to bring it in as there is no road leading to the village.  There is only a narrow and now-muddy footpath along a cliff. It is a dangerous and steep climb up - and the walk down is also dangerous. When a body has been found families have been forced to carry their relative down this footpath for a formal burial.  Sombre-looking men have been building tombs over graves, while women and children in these farming communities have not stopped weeping. Disaster relief officials have been quoted as saying that drones are being used in the search-and-rescue operations. One man I spoke to said he spotted them on Tuesday, but he has not seen any since. For the villagers, there is only one option: to keep digging with spades, pick axes and their bare hands in the hope of finding their loved ones - alive. Fortunately, the weather held up on Wednesday, making it easier.  Gofa is part of the state known as Southern Ethiopia, located around 320km (199 miles) south-west of the capital, Addis Ababa. It is among the areas of the country that have been hit by particularly heavy rain and flooding in recent months. But instances of landslides and floods go back further. In May 2016, at least 50 people were killed in floods and landslides following heavy rain across the south of the country. The UN’s humanitarian office (Ocha) says $3bn (£2.3bn) is needed for Ethiopia to help those affected by El Niño over the last year - which has brought drought and flooding - as well as conflict, but the drive had been “woefully underfunded”. “With the extremes of rain coming we also expect more of these kinds of emergencies to continue,” Ocha's Ethiopia head, Paul Handley, told the BBC's Newsday programme.  In the area engulfed by the landslides, there were concerns about the stability of the slope and 10,000 people in the area needed to be evacuated “out of harm’s way”,  Mr Handley added.

692,What one Moscow square says about Russia's worsening relations with West,"Moscow's Europe Square is no more. The city’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, has signed an order renaming this place Eurasia Square.  It's a little change that says a lot about the direction in which Russia is moving: away from the West. It’s not the prettiest square in the Russian capital. It's certainly no match for Red Square, with the breathtaking onion domes of St Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin. Eurasia Square is built beside the bustling ""Kyiv Railway Station"" and a hotel, where the BBC’s Moscow Office was once located. There’s a fountain and an unusual composition created by a Belgian sculptor entitled ""The Abduction of Europe"". I remember when this square was constructed just over 20 years ago. It was built as a symbol of unity on the continent of Europe. There were once dozens of flags of different European countries flying here. They were removed last year, and now the name’s gone too. Goodbye Europe; hello Eurasia. But what exactly is Eurasia? Different countries have different concepts of Eurasia. President Vladimir Putin officially terms Russia a Eurasian power. He uses the word to mean Russia is geographically in Europe and Asia but civilisationally distinct from both. Europe Square's commemorative plaque still stands. It reads: “As a token of stronger friendship and unity between the European countries, the government of Moscow has decided to create the ensemble of the Square of Europe in the Russian capital.” The reality is that Russia’s war in Ukraine and Western sanctions have put enormous strain on relations between Moscow and Europe. The Russian authorities talk constantly now of the need to tilt east and look towards China, North Korea, Asia as a whole. Europe isn’t just out of fashion - it is portrayed by the Russian authorities as the enemy. It’s not the first time that the Moscow authorities have played politics with street names after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022 the street where the US embassy is located was renamed “Donetsk People’s Republic Square,” a reference to the self-proclaimed breakaway region of Ukraine, which Russia later claimed to have annexed. In similar fashion, the following month the area around the British embassy became “Luhansk People’s Republic Square"". Back on (former) Europe Square, what do passers-by make of the change to Eurasia? “It’s the right decision,” Olga tells me. “We’re not friends with Europe right now. I don’t want to be in Europe.” “Eurasia is good,” says Anna. “Russia borders Europe and Asia. I was born in Kazakhstan, so this is fine with me.” “Europe has different standards now,” Pasha tells me. “They think in a different way. We’re gradually splitting away.” But Yevgeniya is disappointed. She sees the name change as ""a sign of conflict between different countries."" ""It’s so sad,"" she adds. But at the end of the day, does a name really matter? Following the 1917 Russian Revolution so many streets and squares in Russia were renamed to feature the word ""communism"". Did it help the Soviet Union build communism? Not in the slightest. The decision to ditch the word Europe from a square doesn’t mean that Russia won’t one day, once again, look West.",2024-07-24 23:10:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng8e3j72yo,Unknown,Unknown,
691,British police filmed stamping on man's head at airport,"A police officer has been filmed kicking and stamping on the head of a man lying on the ground at Manchester Airport. The uniformed male officer is seen holding a Taser over the man, who is lying face down, before striking him twice while other officers shout at onlookers to stay back in a video shared widely online. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said firearms officers had been attacked while attempting to arrest someone following a fight in the airport's Terminal 2 on Tuesday. The force said it had referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) over the events and one officer had been removed from operational duties.  In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said: ""We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about.  ""The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm. ""One male officer has been removed from operational duties and we are making a voluntary referral of our policing response to the Independent Office of Police Conduct."" The IOPC said it would assess GMP's referral ""and decide what further action is required"". Firearms officers had been called to the airport at about 20:25 BST on Tuesday after reports of an altercation by members of the public, a police spokesman said. Three officers were ""punched to the ground"" in a ""violent assault"" when they attempted to arrest one of the suspects, he added. “As the attending officers were firearms officers, there was a clear risk during this assault of their firearms being taken from them."" Three officers were taken to hospital for treatment, with one female officer suffering a broken nose. Two men were arrested on suspicion of assault, assault on an emergency worker, affray, and obstructing police, while two other men were also arrested on suspicion of affray and assault on an emergency worker, police confirmed. Amar Minhas from Leeds told the BBC he was coming through arrivals when he saw the scene unfold. He said police officers had approached one of the men, in his early 20s, and told him he was a wanted man, before “they pinned him up against a wall”. Another man then “started on the police” and a fight ensued, he said. The man who was being pinned against the wall started “throwing punches, he was Tasered, and fell to the floor”, Mr Minhas said. “That’s when the policeman kicked him."" The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, described the video as ""disturbing"" and said he recognised ""the widespread and deep concern"" it had caused. He said he had raised his concerns with GMP's deputy chief constable. Andy George, president of the National Black Police Association, described the video as ""difficult to watch"". In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: ""Whilst policing is a really difficult job, we are trained to a higher standard and held to a higher standard."" Home Office minister Dame Diana Johnson also posted on X: “I am aware of disturbing footage from an incident at Manchester Airport this afternoon and understand the public concern it has prompted. “I have asked for a full update from Greater Manchester Police.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

711,Why tech bros are turning to Trump,"Donald Trump, whose time in office made him a pariah to many in the business world, has found new champions among tech leaders as his path back to the White House takes shape. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, became the biggest name yet to throw his weight behind the former president this month, endorsing him and getting involved in fundraising efforts. The move capped weeks of mounting support from the tech world, as influential venture capitalists and tech leaders, including former Democratic donor Allison Huynh, investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and the Winklevoss twins, players in the world of crypto, rallied publicly around Trump. Support for Trump is hardly universal.  But it marks a sharp turn from just a few years ago, when companies rushed to distance themselves from Trump in the weeks after the 2021 US Capitol riot.  Coming from Silicon Valley, where backing a ban on gay marriage - a Republican cause - once cost an executive his job, the change is especially striking. At a cryptocurrency event at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Nicholas Longo, 27, of wealth management firm Fortuna Investors, said when he voted for Trump four years ago he felt there was stigma attached. ""In 2020, it would have been inadvisable for me to express support for Donald Trump,” he said. Now, all that has changed. The shift in the political winds has long been evident on social media, where Mr Musk and investor David Sacks are among those to regularly scorn President Joe Biden.  But their decision to open their wallets to the Trump campaign is poised to significantly expand their influence beyond their traditional circle - with major consequences for the election. The support from tech leaders has helped Trump close the fundraising gap that he faced against Mr Biden a few months ago.  ""He was pretty far behind and struggling at the end of April,""  said Sarah Bryner, research director at OpenSecrets. ""In the last eight weeks, it's a completely different campaign.""  She said the pledges sent a strong signal on how the tide is turning, noting that signs of victory at the polls often help push potential donors off the fence.  ""Success begets success,"" she said.  Data from OpenSecrets shows Democrats claiming the larger share of venture capitalist donations in recent elections - and Mr Biden's decision to bow out of the race is expected to ignite further interest. However, Trump's new friends remain committed.  According to the Wall Street Journal earlier this month, Mr Musk pledged $45m a month to the Trump campaign - which would make him one of the biggest donors this year.  The billionaire has acknowledged his work on fundraising efforts tied to the campaign, but denied the sum, saying his contributions will be at a ""much lower level"". ""I believe in an America that maximizes individual freedom and merit. That used to be the Democratic Party, but now the pendulum has swung to the Republican Party,"" Mr Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns that was formerly known as Twitter, after Mr Biden dropped out.  Analysts said the backing from key figures in the tech world suggested that Trump was widening his appeal. ""He's convinced Republicans he's not as bad as they say... and now we're seeing that's broadening out,"" said Sal Russo, a veteran Republican consultant based in California. ""Do I think he's going to win Santa Clara County? No, but he's going to do better,"" said Mr Russo. Tech leaders have said they are concerned about the Biden administration's crackdown on crypto, and cautious approach to artificial intelligence. For example, a recent executive order requires firms to comply with government AI safety standards. ""Bad government policies are now the #1 threat to Little Tech,"" Mr Andreessen and Mr Horowitz, whose firm invests in start-ups and is a big player in crypto and AI, wrote in a recent essay. ""The time has come to stand up."" Mr Musk's decision to back Trump might appear a startling shift for a man who had historically shunned political donations. He reportedly once waited in line for six hours to shake Barack Obama’s hand, and as recently as 2018 described himself as politically moderate. In 2017, he was among the first members to quit a White House business council, parting ways with Trump over climate change policies.  His company, Tesla, makes electric cars, which Trump has repeatedly criticised as expensive and impractical.  However, Mr Musk has long bristled at oversight by financial regulators. His criticism of Mr Biden ramped up two years ago, after he did not get an invite to a White House business meeting, a snub that led him to tell CNBC he felt unfairly ""ignored"".  On social media, he has increasingly waded into other debates over Covid lockdowns, the war in Ukraine, China policy and transgender issues.  Mr Musk, whose SpaceX rocket firm does billions of dollars of government business, has a relationship with a possible Trump administration to consider as well. Democrats said the shift in the tech world has been motivated by self-interest, noting that Mr Biden has proposed new taxes on multi-millionaires and unrealised capital gains.  He has also alienated some with his embrace of organised labour, and his administration's pursuit of tech companies in anti-monopoly and other cases.  Businessman Mark Cuban, who supports Democrats, suggested that the gravitation towards Trump was a ""bitcoin play"" - a bet that cryptocurrency value could be boosted by high inflation and political chaos that Democrats say would result under a Trump administration. Stanford Business School professor Neil Malhotra, who has studied the political views of tech founders, said it would be a mistake to conflate the ""most vocal people on Twitter"" with the industry overall - or even its elites, whose views historically have straddled both parties. A 2017 survey he and colleagues conducted found that as a group, tech leaders   were aligned with Democrats on issues such as gay marriage and abortion - even taxes. However, they swung Republican in strongly opposing regulation. He noted that since the survey, new social issues such as policing, schooling and transgender rights have come to the fore. San Francisco has been a key battleground in those debates, driving some of the tech world backlash.  ""The suspicion is that most people in venture capital are still centre-left,"" Prof Malhotra said. But, he added: ""There’s definitely a movement to the Republican Party."" Evan Swarztrauber, an adviser to the Foundation for American Innovation thinktank, said tech leaders were betting Trump would be more hands-off on crypto and AI. But the gamble is not without risk.  As president, Trump won praise from the business community by cutting taxes, putting anti-labour officials in charge of labour rights and generally veering away from regulation. But he also took a markedly more interventionist approach to the economy - and to tech - than previous administrations - starting a trade war with China, ordering a TikTok ban, and launching some of the ongoing anti-monopoly lawsuits against tech companies. Since then, he has pushed the Republican party further in that direction - while at the same time moderating or reversing himself on issues such as the TikTok ban and crypto. Jennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow in tech policy for the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump may be shifting his stance on some tech issues, noting that he is now the owner of a social media platform. JD Vance, Trump's choice for vice-president, also previously worked in venture capital and got key support from PayPal's Peter Thiel during his 2022 senate campaign. But she warned that the effort to distinguish between the interests of ""big"" tech and ""little"" tech would prove difficult when it comes time to govern. David Broockman, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said Trump was finding success in the business world by presenting himself as more moderate than other members of his party on social issues such as abortion. After boasting of being ""proudly the person responsible"" for removing Roe v Wade protections, Trump has rejected claims he will back a national ban pushed by many conservatives, and says the matter should be left up to the states. But Prof Broockman noted that Trump also ran a relatively moderate campaign in 2016, only to adopt more extreme policies once in office.  Those hurt his public approval and eventually frayed Republican ties to Wall Street, a traditional source of support for the party.  ""Tech and other business leaders are banking on a lot of Trump's more eccentric policy ideas ... just not happening,"" Prof Broockman said. ""But they really could happen."" Outside of tech, Trump has backed radical changes including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, a dramatic reduction in the government workforce and a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the country. But Garrett Johnson, co-founder of the Foundation for American Innovation and now an executive at a venture-backed tech firm, said he thought that as time had passed more tech and business elites have come around to Trump's views. ""Trump singlehandedly made the threat that China poses to our country a national topic,"" he said. ""He was right and everyone else had to come along."" ""So absolutely I think that is part of the dynamic, of the vibe shift,"" he said. ""Was he right on everything? No, but on many big issues Trump was right.""

709,"Gaza release deal has to happen now, hostage's mother says","Ayelet Levy Shachar turned down an invitation to get on Benjamin Netanyahu’s plane to Washington. Her daughter, Naama Levy, was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen from an Israeli army observation post near the Gaza border on 7 October. It was not a political decision, she told me, saying she’d been “honoured” to be asked by the Israeli prime minister, but the timing was wrong. Ayelet’s face lights up when she talks about Naama, who turned 20 years old in captivity, describing her as a determined and fun-loving young woman, a good student and athlete. She’s hopeful her nine-month nightmare might be coming to an end. “We have heard from defence and security forces that they're reaching the point of breaking a deal,” she says. “And we have never before been in such a promising point at that sense.” “Nothing should be distracting [us] at this point... this is what we should be dealing with right now. I'm asking and hoping that our prime minister’s commitment to this will be his first priority.” Some relatives of men and women still held captive in Gaza did travel to Washington with the Israeli prime minister. They were joined by Noa Argamani, the 26-year-old woman who was rescued by Israeli forces in June. It was a controversial decision, as those campaigning for the hostage release deal had been holding protests urging Mr Netanyahu not to go before bringing their loved ones home. When the Israeli prime minister arrived in the US on Monday, he told families of the hostages that an agreement could be nearing, but that military pressure on Hamas must continue. “We see that the enemy's spirit is starting to break,” he said at the first meeting of his visit. “I believe if we are steadfast in this, we can achieve a deal.” “I am not prepared in any way to give in on the victory over Hamas.” Israel launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the attack on southern Israel last October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory’s health ministry. Mr Netanyahu has been resisting pressure to accept a proposed ceasefire deal that would allow an exchange of the remaining 116 hostages, 44 of whom are believed to be dead, for Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s security establishment has been signalling that an agreement is possible since Hamas recently dropped its demand for an upfront guarantee of a permanent ceasefire. According to Israeli media reports and BBC sources close to the indirect talks, the negotiations have since bogged down again on Israeli demands that soldiers maintain supervision of corridors along the Egyptian border and in the centre of Gaza, in particular on Mr Netanyahu’s insistence for a mechanism to prevent armed fighters from returning to the northern part of the strip. ""Now is the money time,” Col Lior Lotan, a close adviser to Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, told Israel’s Channel 12 News on Friday. “The terms of the deal includes risks that the defence establishment can tolerate... All the heads of the security services say this. To counter them with a hypothetical, as if it were possible to get more through more military pressure, would be wrong.” Warning: Some readers may find the image below disturbing. This week, Israel confirmed that two more of the hostages had died in captivity several months ago, one of them possibly killed by Israeli military fire - a reminder of the cost of delaying a deal. Ayelet told us that Naama had arrived at the observation post just two days before the Hamas attack on Israel last year, after completing her basic training. “I don’t think she knew where the safe room was,” her mother said. She did find it and sent a message from there, the last her family heard before a video surfaced showing her with tied hands and bloodied sweatpants being forced into the back of a jeep. Last week, the families of the five female soldiers kidnapped from the observation post published photos of them in their early days of captivity, to remind the world about their daughters’ fate. These were screenshots taken from a Hamas video retrieved by the Israeli army during operations in Gaza. One photo shows four of the young women sitting on mattresses, some of them with bandages. Naama is not among them. She is not being held with the others, said Ayelet. There is an image of her with one of her eyes discoloured and swollen shut. Based on information from hostages released during a previous ceasefire and exchange deal in November, Naama’s family understand that her captors moved her from place to place to avoid Israeli military action, and that she had shrapnel injuries in her legs, but was able to walk. They’ve been told by Israeli security forces since then there is “proof of life” without being given details. The latest information they have is that she’s being held in Hamas tunnels. Mr Netanyahu is sending the Israeli negotiating team to Doha on Thursday to continue the talks. The process keeps Ayelet’s hope alive, mixed with desperation as a resolution remains elusive. “Both sides are coming closer with their demands,” she says. “Even saying that it sounds wrong to me, because how can you be talking about demands when you're talking about my daughter's life? We are over nine months so I’m actually feeling desperate. It has to happen. It has to happen.” Thinking about her daughter helps give her strength to cope with the grinding fear and uncertainty. “I wake up in the morning and she's still there. I count the days, I count the minutes. How can I stop?” she says. “I think she's very strong. And maybe I'm, you know, focusing on that, on that belief that she's very strong and determined, and smart. And she can survive this.”",2024-07-24 23:10:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3e05n1xy3o,Unknown,Unknown,
708,Surge in attacks brings fear to calmer parts of Kashmir,"On 9 June, Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir saw one of its deadliest attacks in years. Nine Hindu pilgrims were killed and more than 30 people were injured after militants opened fire on a bus that was making its way to a shrine in the region. The firing that took place in Reasi - one of 10 districts in Jammu - is among numerous attacks on the army and civilians in the region in recent months. Violence is not new to the scenic region, but a recent trend has worried experts - the centre of militant activity seems to be shifting from Kashmir Valley to the relatively less-affected Jammu area. The Himalayan region of Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan. Since 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars and a limited conflict over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim but only partly control. An armed insurgency against Delhi's rule in the Indian-administered region since 1989 has claimed thousands of lives. The Indian government says that violence has reduced since 2019, when it revoked a constitutional provision that gave the region special autonomy. But there seems to be a sharp uptick in violence in recent months, particularly in Jammu, stoking fears of militancy returning to that region. Since 2021, there have been 33 militant-related attacks in Jammu, according to official data. In 2024 alone, the region has seen eight attacks, in which 11 soldiers have been killed and 18 injured. Civilian deaths in Jammu in the first six months of this year were 12, the same number as the whole of 2023. The attacks occurred in Rajouri, Poonch, Doda, Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi and other areas of the Jammu division. Like the Kashmir valley, Jammu too is near the Line of Control, the de facto border with Pakistan. Delhi has accused Islamabad of supplying militants with weapons, drugs, and money via drones. Pakistan has not officially responded to these allegations. Experts say the recent spate of attacks in Jammu suggests that militant activity has spread deeper into the federal territory. One reason, some say, could be the high concentration of security forces and intelligence activity in the valley, which may have forced militants to move southwards. Others think it is a deliberate attempt to divert the army’s attention from other strategic areas in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the insurgency began, the valley has been the epicentre of the conflict. Militancy had spilled over into Jammu in the late 1990s, but the region has been relatively calm since 2002. So, the rise in militant activity in Jammu since 2021 (two years after India scrapped the region's special status) and the back-to-back strikes in the past few months have deeply unsettled the entire security apparatus in Jammu and Kashmir. Reports indicate that militants, armed with sophisticated assault rifles and well-trained in jungle warfare, have been using the forests and treacherous terrain of Jammu to hide from the security forces. The attacks took place in areas of the Jammu province where the terrain is tough and road connectivity is poor, making it hard for security forces to reach the spot on time.  Retired Colonel Bhuwanesh Thapa, father of a soldier who was killed in Doda last week, told reporters that his son had called him before leaving for the search operation and that his team had been preparing to undertake a six to seven-hour trek to reach the location. Shesh Paul Vaid, a former police chief who had been involved in anti-insurgency operations in the valley, believes that the spike in militant attacks in Jammu is a ploy to “divert attention” from Kashmir. He also attributes the spurt in violence to a ""well-thought-out policy"" by China and Pakistan to stretch out India’s armed forces. Like Pakistan, China too shares a disputed border with India in the Himalayan region. Known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), it falls close to Ladakh, a mountainous territory to the east of Jammu and Kashmir.  According to reports, India’s stand-off with China in the Ladakh region since 2020 has compelled it to send additional troops to the cold desert. These forces were reportedly pulled out from Jammu, leaving the region vulnerable to militant activities. For long, India's strategic community has feared the prospect of a two-front war along its northern and western borders. Experts believe that any military collusion between Pakistan and China will stretch India’s defences. “The thinning of troops [in Jammu] is making an impact. The militants are taking advantage of it,” said Lt Gen Deependra Singh Hooda, a former military commander. Lt Col Suneel Bartwal, an army spokesperson in Jammu, told the BBC that the army had been conducting a series of “joint and co-ordinated operations” with police to eliminate “foreign terrorists”. He added that a number of measures had been taken to enhance synergy between various security agencies in the region. Some experts also point out that India's intelligence network in Jammu is less developed than in Kashmir due to its relative calm and fewer incidents of violence since 2002. Political analyst Zafar Choudhary says for the past three decades, counter-insurgency specialists have been stationed in Kashmir and not in Jammu. “They [forces] have understood the terrain and topography of the Kashmir valley over the years, [but] not much of Jammu,” he says.",2024-07-24 23:10:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728l7n57n7o,Unknown,Unknown,
710,Drenched in blood - how Bangladesh protests turned deadly,"Anti-government protests have sparked nationwide clashes in Bangladesh between police and university students. At least 150 people have been killed - and some of those caught up in the bloodshed have described to the BBC what happened.  One student said demonstrators in the capital Dhaka just wanted to hold a peaceful rally, but the police ""ruined"" it by attacking them as they were gathering. A student leader now recovering in hospital described how he was blindfolded and tortured by people claiming to be police. Meanwhile, an emergency department doctor said they were overwhelmed as dozens of young people with gunshot wounds were brought in at the height of the clashes. Security forces are accused of excessive force but the government has blamed political opponents for the unrest, which erupted after quotas were imposed on government jobs. Most of these have now been scrapped on Supreme Court orders. A nationwide internet blackout since Thursday has restricted the flow of information in the country, where a curfew is being enforced by thousands of soldiers. Limited connectivity was restored on Tuesday night, with priority given to companies such as banks, technology firms and media outlets. Mobile phones have started pinging with WhatsApp messages between friends and families, but users say the internet is slow, while mobile internet and sites such as Facebook remain suspended. The violence is the most serious challenge in years to Sheikh Hasina, 76, who secured her fourth straight term as prime minister in January, in a controversial election boycotted by the country's main opposition parties. WARNING: This piece contains descriptions of violence that some readers may find distressing. Raya (not her real name), a student at the private BRAC university, told BBC Bangla she first joined the protests on Wednesday 17 July, but it was the following day that clashes with police got ""really horrible"". ""Police attacked students by throwing tear gas shells after 11:30am. At that moment, a few students picked up those tear gas shells and threw them back towards the policemen,"" was how she described it. She said the police later started using rubber bullets and at one point trapped the students in their campus, even stopping them from taking the badly injured to hospital. Then, in the afternoon, the police ordered them to leave. ""On that day, we just wanted to do a peaceful rally, but the police ruined the whole environment before we could do anything,"" Raya said. Things took an even darker turn on 19 July, the day when most of the fatalities happened. By 10:00, hundreds of protesters were battling police at Natun Bazaar near  Rampura, not far from a normally secure district that's home to numerous embassies which now resembled a war zone. The protesters were hurling bricks and stones at police who responded with shotgun fire, tear-gas and sound grenades, while a helicopter was firing from the air. BBC reporters saw fires everywhere, burnt and vandalised vehicles left on the street, barricades – set up by police as well as protesters – dismantled steel road barriers and broken branches scattered on the road. The police could be seen asking for reinforcements and ammunition which was quickly running out.  By this time hospitals in the city were starting to see large numbers of injured, many arriving on foot drenched in blood.  Emergency departments were overwhelmed as hundreds of patients flooded in over a short span of time.  “We referred critically injured patients to Dhaka Medical College Hospital as we could not manage them here,” one doctor who did not want to be named told BBC Bangla, saying most of the victims had been shot with rubber bullets. Also speaking on condition of anonymity, another doctor at a government hospital said for a few hours it seemed like every other minute someone injured came in.  ""On Thursday and Friday, most of the patients came with injury from gunshots,"" the doctor said. ""On Thursday we performed 30 surgeries on a single six-hour shift. ""It was unnerving even for an experienced doctor... some of my colleagues and I were really nervous to treat so many injured young people."" The situation got worse by Friday evening with the government declaring a nationwide curfew and deploying the army on the streets. It was after Friday's violence that one of the student leaders, Nahid Islam, went missing. His father said he was taken from a friend's house at midnight on Friday, and reappeared more than 24 hours later. Nahid himself then described how he had been picked up and taken to a room in a house, interrogated and subjected to physical and mental torture by people claiming to be detectives. He says he fainted and only regained consciousness early on Sunday morning, at which point he walked home and sought hospital treatment for blood clots on both shoulders and his left leg. In response to his allegations, Information Minister Mohammad Ali Arafat told the BBC the incident would be investigated but that he suspected ""sabotage"" - that someone was trying to discredit the police. ""My question is, if someone from the government has gone, why would they pick him up, detain him for 12 hours and release him somewhere, so that he can come back and make such a complaint?"" There are also questions about those who died, some of whom do not seem to have a proven connection to the protest movement. BBC Bangla spoke to relatives of Maruf Hossain, 21, who was jobhunting in Dhaka after finishing his studies. His mother said she told him not to go out during the protests but he was shot in the back while trying to escape the fighting, and later died in hospital. Another of the dead, Selim Mandal, a construction worker, was trapped in a fire which broke out in the early hours of Sunday morning after violence in the area at a site where he was both working and living. His charred body was found with those of two others. The cause of the fire is unknown. Hasib Iqbal, 27, who died in the violence, was said to be a member of the protest movement but not deeply involved. His family said he wasn't really a part of it, but they're not sure how he died.  His father was shocked to learn of the death of his son, who had gone to Friday prayers. “We were supposed to go to prayers together, but since I was a little late, he went to the mosque alone,” Mr Razzaq told BBC Bengali. Mr Razzaq later went out to look for him but only found out he had died hours later. His death certificate said he died of asphyxiation but relatives at his funeral found black marks on his chest. Mr Razzaq does not plan to file a complaint with the police because ""my son will never come back"". ""My only son,"" he said, ""I never dreamed of losing him like this.""",2024-07-24 23:10:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng5v03gd4o,Unknown,Unknown,
704,Kamala Harris is counting on her sorority sisters,"There are many glass ceilings a Kamala Harris presidency could shatter. One of them is that she could be the first black sorority member to sit in the Oval Office. The US vice-president, who spoke on Wednesday at the biennial convention of Zeta Phi Beta, is a life-time member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. The two organisations are among the predominantly black sororities and fraternities that make up the National Pan-Hellenic Council. Commonly called the Divine Nine, its nearly four million members are poised to become a secret weapon as Ms Harris seeks the presidency. Less than 24 hours after Joe Biden endorsed his deputy to seek the Democratic nomination in his place, the group vowed to launch an ""unprecedented voter registration, education and mobilisation"" drive. As a non-profit, the National Pan-Hellenic Council is non-partisan and cannot officially endorse Ms Harris. But it is promising a campaign that ""will activate the thousands of chapters and members in our respective organisations to ensure strong voter turnout in the communities we serve"". That is in line with how the Divine Nine historically gets behind its own. Its members have supported Ms Harris, 59, in the past as she climbed the ladder of national politics. Greek life on US university campuses typically evokes images of young white men or women living together in group houses and drinking booze out of red solo cups. But black Greek-letter clubs emerged at the turn of the 20th century as support systems that offered kinship to black students experiencing segregation and social isolation at majority-white institutions.  The first black fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, began as a study group at Cornell in 1906, according to The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities by Lawrence C Ross. Its membership has included civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Olympic gold medallist Jesse Owens. Ms Harris pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation's oldest black sorority, as a senior - or fourth-year student - at Howard University in Washington DC. She has previously said the experience ""changed my life"". Both in its individual parts and as a collective, the Divine Nine is built around shared values of scholarship, civic engagement and community service. It has lobbied in the past for everything from federal anti-lynching legislation and women's suffrage to high school tutoring and financial aid opportunities for black youth, according to Mr Ross's book. Membership is for life, he writes, which is ""almost spiritual"" and ""makes you realize that your life on earth has more meaning than just your own selfish needs"". Of her AKA connection, Ms Harris said in 2019: ""Throughout your life, you find friends who become family and – like family – they help shape you and your life experiences. For me, that was the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. who became my sisters."" That year, as the then-California senator launched a campaign for president, her fellow ""sorors"" canvassed and phone-banked to get out the vote. When she became Mr Biden's running mate, images of AKAs and other Divine Niners, accessorised with heels and pearls, went viral for their Stroll to the Polls in Atlanta, in the battleground state of Georgia. The Biden-Harris ticket went on to narrowly win the state, powered in part by strong black turnout. Though Ms Harris's candidacy for the November 2024 election is only a few days old, the backing of her sisters is already providing consequential. On a Sunday night Zoom call, the group Win With Black Women - which includes several Divine Nine members - helped raise more than $1m (£775,000) in roughly three hours for the nascent campaign. ""People are just energised,"" Crystal Sewell, an AKA leader, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. ""And really really excited about possibilities [as] it relates to VP Harris and her candidacy."" Ms Harris, who is seeking to make history as America's first female president, is leaning into that enthusiasm. Speaking to 6,000 fired up Zeta Phi Beta women at a convention centre in Indianapolis on Wednesday, she promised them ""we are not playing around"" if she defeats Donald Trump this November. Her keynote address was scheduled weeks ago, but - touching on topics such as abortion, gun control and Project 2025 - the vice-president laid out the stakes of her candidacy. ""We face a choice between two different visions for our nation,"" she told the crowd. ""One focused on the future, the other focused on the past. With your support, I am fighting for our nation's future."" ""So let us continue to fight,"" she added, ""because when we fight, we win.""",2024-07-24 23:10:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05p714907o,Unknown,Unknown,
707,Nicolás Maduro: The leader who promised to win 'by hook or by crook',"When President Nicolás Maduro took to the stage on 4 February this year to mark the anniversary of a failed coup lead by his mentor, Hugo Chávez, his rhetoric was always going to be fiery. The fourth of February is the day when followers of Chavismo, the political movement created by the late Chávez, celebrate its foundation in 1992.  Speaking to a loyal crowd of Chavistas dressed in their traditional red T-shirts, he urged them to show ""nerves of steel"" ahead of this July's presidential election. He had good reason to do so. Last October, 2.4 million Venezuelans cast their vote in a primary organised by a coalition of opposition parties.  It was won by María Corina Machado with 93% of the vote. Ms Machado has since become Mr Maduro's most formidable opponent, managing what had eluded others before her - to unite the notoriously divided Venezuelan opposition behind one leader. During his 11 years in power, Mr Maduro has managed to run rings around the opposition time and time again, aided by the fact that opposition leaders often seemed to spend more time attacking each other than concentrating on beating him.  And maybe it was that nervousness which led Mr Maduro not just to predict a victory in the upcoming election - something many candidates do - but to add that he would win ""by hook or by crook"". To opposition activists who have long bemoaned being the victims of government harassment, the president's remark came as no surprise.  But it is nevertheless a telling slip of the tongue from the leader of a movement which likes to portray itself as representing a mass of Venezuelans, whose loyal support, they argue, has afforded it many an election victory and kept it in power without interruption since 1999.  It is not the first time Mr Maduro's words have raised eyebrows.  Mr Maduro's detractors have long made fun of his verbal gaffes and his humble beginnings as a bus driver.  But the 61-year-old has used his past to his advantage, cultivating his image as a ""man of the people"", dancing salsa with his wife during his rambling TV shows and never missing an occasion to whack a baseball, throw a basketball or spar with a boxer.  And while he never achieved the popularity among Chavistas that his predecessor Hugo Chávez had, he has so far managed to remain the movement's uncontested leader.  This was far from a given when he was picked by Hugo Chávez in 2012 as his heir after the latter was diagnosed with cancer.  Many had thought Chávez would choose Diosdado Cabello, a fiery and combative military man, for the role of acting president while the ailing leader was receiving treatment in Cuba.  But Chávez instead anointed Mr Maduro, whom he had just named vice-president after serving six years as Chávez's foreign minister. Following Chávez's death in March 2013, Mr Maduro narrowly won the election the president's death had triggered, defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles by 1.6 percentage points - a result Mr Capriles disputed. In 2018, Mr Maduro sailed to victory by a wide margin in elections which were roundly dismissed as neither free nor fair.  The main opposition coalition had decided to boycott the polls after a raft of candidates were arrested or had fled the country, leaving the field virtually empty for Mr Maduro.  Arguably, one of Mr Maduro's main achievements has been how he has managed over the past 11 years not only to prevent any challenges to his rule within his PSUV party, but also to form strong alliances with those who have backed him.  His defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, has been in the post for almost a decade, ensuring that the armed forces remain behind him. The support of the armed forces was key when the then leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself the rightful president in January 2019, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election in 2018 had been fraudulent.  The hope of the opposition that Mr Guaidó would replace Mr Maduro in the presidential palace was soon quashed, with all the major institutions remaining under the firm control of the government.  Allies of Mr Maduro also control the main electoral body, the Supreme Court and the Attorney-General's office, among others. Suspicious of outsiders, he surrounds himself with a close-knit group of trusted politicians, whom he rotates through different high-ranking posts.  Among them is Delcy Rodríguez, who has served as his communications minister, his foreign minister and most recently, as his vice-president.  Her brother Jorge is another close Maduro ally, who currently heads the government-controlled National Assembly.  Mr Maduro and some in his inner circle - including his defence minister - have been further welded together by being charged by the US authorities in 2020 with ""narco-terrorism"" and drug trafficking.   The president used the indictment to portray himself as a fighter against ""US imperialist forces"", which he claims are targeting him because he ""stands up for the people"". He also blames US sanctions for the dire economic crisis which Venezuela has suffered under his leadership.  Almost eight million Venezuelans have left the country over the past decade, driven out by a combination of widespread shortages and increasing political repression.  To stop the economy's freefall, in 2019 Mr Maduro relaxed some of the strict foreign currency regulations brought in by Chávez. Shortages have eased since then, but those without access to foreign currency continue to struggle. Opinion polls suggest Mr Maduro's popularity has plummeted over the years, in large part because of the economic downturn he has presided over. Nevertheless, his socialist PSUV party can still draw on a hard core of supporters, as well as considerable number of people who have benefited financially from his rule.  His government's actions in recent months, however, appear to betray his worry that his powerful party machine may not be able to win the election if the vote is free and fair.  First, the comptroller-general, a government ally, banned his foremost rival, María Corina Machado, from running for office - a decision which was later confirmed by the government-controlled Supreme Court. Then, the woman whom the opposition coalition had chosen to replace her on the ballot was prevented from registering.  Finally, a relatively unknown former diplomat, Edmundo González, was confirmed as the opposition coalition's unity candidate in April.  Mr González has sailed past Mr Maduro in the opinion polls in record time, with some giving the 74-year-old a lead of 40% over the president.  In response, Mr Maduro's rhetoric has become more belligerent, even evoking the risk of a ""civil war"" should he lose.  “If you don't want a bloodbath in Venezuela, a civil war brought about by the fascists, then let's strive for the biggest success, the biggest victory in the electoral history of our people,"" he told voters less than two weeks before the election.  Invoking a bloodbath may seem extreme, but Mr Maduro has much to lose, were he to be defeated at the polls. Not only has the US offered a $15m reward (£11.6m) for his capture on ""narcoterrorism"" charges, but he is also under investigation at the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity committed by the security forces during the crackdown on a wave of anti-government protests in 2017.  No one should be surprised if, faced with an election defeat, the former bus driver refuses to accept that he has reached the end of the line.  Many fear he will not go quietly.

723,Police filmed stamping on man's head at airport,"A police officer has been filmed kicking and stamping on the head of a man lying on the ground at Manchester Airport. The uniformed male officer is seen holding a Taser over the man, who is lying face down, before striking him twice while other officers shout at onlookers to stay back in a video shared widely online. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said firearms officers had been attacked while attempting to arrest someone following a fight in the airport's Terminal 2 on Tuesday. The force said it had referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) over the events and one officer had been removed from operational duties.  In a statement, Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry said: ""We know that a film of an incident at Manchester Airport that is circulating widely shows an event that is truly shocking, and that people are rightly extremely concerned about.  ""The use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm. ""One male officer has been removed from operational duties and we are making a voluntary referral of our policing response to the Independent Office of Police Conduct."" The IOPC said it would assess GMP's referral ""and decide what further action is required"". Firearms officers had been called to the airport at about 20:25 BST on Tuesday after reports of an altercation by members of the public, a police spokesman said. Three officers were ""punched to the ground"" in a ""violent assault"" when they attempted to arrest one of the suspects, he added. “As the attending officers were firearms officers, there was a clear risk during this assault of their firearms being taken from them."" Three officers were taken to hospital for treatment, with one female officer suffering a broken nose. Two men were arrested on suspicion of assault, assault on an emergency worker, affray, and obstructing police, while two other men were also arrested on suspicion of affray and assault on an emergency worker, police confirmed. Amar Minhas from Leeds told the BBC he was coming through arrivals when he saw the scene unfold. He said police officers had approached one of the men, in his early 20s, and told him he was a wanted man, before “they pinned him up against a wall”. Another man then “started on the police” and a fight ensued, he said. The man who was being pinned against the wall started “throwing punches, he was Tasered, and fell to the floor”, Mr Minhas said. “That’s when the policeman kicked him."" The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, described the video as ""disturbing"" and said he recognised ""the widespread and deep concern"" it had caused. He said he had raised his concerns with GMP's deputy chief constable. Andy George, president of the National Black Police Association, described the video as ""difficult to watch"". In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: ""Whilst policing is a really difficult job, we are trained to a higher standard and held to a higher standard."" Home Office minister Dame Diana Johnson also posted on X: “I am aware of disturbing footage from an incident at Manchester Airport this afternoon and understand the public concern it has prompted. “I have asked for a full update from Greater Manchester Police.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

721,China to raise retirement age as population gets older,"China will gradually raise its statutory retirement age in the next five years to try to cope with its ageing population and buckling pension system. Life expectancy in the country has now risen above the United States, to 78 years, from just 36 years at the time of the Communist revolution in 1949. But China's retirement age remains one of the lowest in the world - at 60 for men, 55 for women in white-collar jobs and 50 for working-class women. The plan to raise retirement ages is part of a series of resolutions adopted last week at a five-yearly top-level Communist party meeting, known as the Third Plenum. ""In line with the principle of voluntary participation with appropriate flexibility, we will advance reform to gradually raise the statutory retirement age in a prudent and orderly manner,"" the party's central committee said in a key policy document highlighting the reforms. It did not specify how much the age of retirement would be raised and by when, but a China Pension Development Report released at the end of 2023 wrote that ""65 years old may be the final result after adjustment"".  The plan has been on the cards for a few years, as China's pension budget dwindles.  The state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said in 2019 that the country's main state pension fund will run out of money by 2035 - and that was an estimate before the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit China's economy hard. At the same time, the country's huge population has fallen for a second consecutive year in 2023 as the birth rate continues to decline. The state-run Global Times newspaper quoted demographers in China saying that the plan to raise the age of retirement highlights ""voluntariness"" and ""flexibility"", which shows that the authorities acknowledge there is no one-size-fits-all policy when it comes to retirement. However the plan has drawn some scepticism on the Chinese internet. ""Those who wish to retire early are burnt out from their laborious jobs, but those who are in comfortable, lucrative roles will not choose to retire. What kind of jobs will the younger generation end up with?"" one user wrote on Weibo, an X-like platform.  Some said a delayed retirement would only mean delayed access to their pensions. ""There is no guarantee that you would still have a job before the statutory retrement age,"" one user wrote.",2024-07-24 23:10:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd9v48yn8ro,Unknown,Unknown,
718,"Assault by fashion mogul Peter Nygard ‘derailed my life’, says victim","A woman who was raped by former fashion mogul Peter Nygard decades ago told a Canadian court that the incident left her traumatised for years. “It breaks my heart to reflect on the derailment of my life caused by this,” said the woman, who was assaulted by Nygard in 1989 when she was in her 20s. Nygard, once the head of a lucrative global apparel empire, is being sentenced this week for sexually assaulting four women. The 83-year-old was convicted last November by a Toronto jury, having denied the charges. Nygard appeared in-person in a Toronto courtroom for the beginning of his sentencing hearing on Wednesday, and was wearing a black sweatshirt with its hood up, and a black puffer jacket overtop. He wore a face-mask and what appeared to be a visor, and his face was barely visible. His two-day sentencing, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, had been repeatedly pushed back, with two of his lawyers resigning over ethical concerns, causing delays. Nygard listened silently as victim impact statements were read in court, including from three of his accusers who detailed how the assaults left them with severe depression and anxiety, and in some instances, derailed their careers. ""The actions that Nygard took have impacted my life in a debilitating way,"" said one woman.  “I did not feel safe being seen. Therefore I did not trust men and did not engage in long-term relationships with anyone for my entire life,” she said.  “Now a 63-year-old woman, I’m deeply saddened by the lack of love in my life.” The sentencing will not be the end of Nygard’s legal challenges. He faces separate sexual assault and sex trafficking charges in Montreal, Winnipeg and in the US.  He has denied any wrongdoing and the other charges have not been tested in court.  Nygard is accused of using his influence and wealth to systematically assault and traffic women in both the US and Canada over a number of decades, when he was at the helm Nygard International, his global clothing design and manufacturing business. Over his six-week criminal trial in Toronto last autumn, prosecutors argued that Nygard - once estimated to be worth at least $700m (£542m) - used his “status” to assault five women in a series of incidents that occurred from the late 1980s to 2005. Most of the women detailed similar stories, in which Nygard lured them with the promise of work or professional help in the fashion industry. Each of them were then invited separately to a tour by Nygard at his Toronto office that ended in his private bedroom suite.  One prosecutor described the room as having “a giant bed … and a bar and doors, doors with no handles and automatic locks controlled by Peter Nygard”. Nygard then raped or sexually assaulted the women inside the bedroom, the court heard. The victims were aged 16 to 28 at the time. On Wednesday, Crown prosecutor Neville Golwalla asked Toronto Superior Court Justice Robert Goldstein to sentence Nygard to 15 years, which he said would take into account his crimes as well as time already served behind bars. “It took decades for these women to get justice and for their experiences to be validated,” he added. His lawyer Gerri Wiebe asked for a lesser sentence, citing Nygard's age and deteriorating health.  The court heard that chronic pain has limited his mobility, and he has type 2 diabetes and glaucoma that requires surgery.  Ms Wiebe argued a lengthy sentence would reduce his life expectancy, and ""would deprive him of any hope of release or rehabilitation"".  Nygard has been in custody since his arrest in late 2020. He has been held at an infirmary inside a Toronto detention center, the court heard, where he has been afforded privileges like his own phone and access to email through his assistant.  During the Toronto trial last year, his defence lawyers argued that his accusers, who are also part of a US class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of his alleged victims, were motivated by financial gain. Nygard also claimed during the trial that he did not recall four of the five women in the case, and that he would have never acted “in that kind of manner”. A jury found him guilty on four counts and not guilty on a fifth count of sexual assault and on one count of forcible confinement. Nygard will now face another sexual assault case in Montreal, where he has been charged with assaulting and forcibly confining a woman more than two decades ago. A preliminary inquiry in that case is set to begin in January 2025. Nygard is also facing charges in Winnipeg related to offences allegedly committed in 1993, involving a woman who was 20 years old at the time. In that case, he is alleged to have held the woman captive and raped her after inviting her to a modeling job. He has denied the charges. Once his criminal cases in Canada are completed, he is expected to be extradited to the US, where authorities claim he engaged in a ""decades-long pattern of criminal conduct"" involving at least a dozen victims across the globe. The US Department of Justice charged him with sex trafficking and racketeering offenses and accused him of targeting “women and minor-aged girls who came from disadvantaged economic backgrounds or had a history of abuse”. A separate class-action lawsuit has also been filed against him by 57 women in the US, though it was put on hold amid his criminal proceedings. In 2020, Nygard stepped down as chairman of his firm shortly before it filed for bankruptcy after US authorities raided its New York headquarters.",2024-07-24 23:10:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ck5gxleelk1o,Unknown,Unknown,

Video shows how a humpback whale suddenly appeared out of the water before flipping over a small, 23-foot (7m) vessel. Two people can be seen falling into the ocean as the huge mammal turns their boat upside down. The footage was filmed by Colin Yanger, who says he was on a nearby boat whose occupants pulled the individuals to safety. The US Coast Guard says no one sustained injuries, and it has reported the incident to the Center of Coastal Studies Marine Animal Hotline and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",2024-07-24 23:10:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80x7kyw2w9o,Unknown,Unknown,
716,Timothee Chalamet sings Bob Dylan in film trailer,"Timothee Chalamet is seen singing as Bob Dylan in the first trailer for a new film in which he plays the folk-rock legend as a young man. The biopic, titled A Complete Unknown, has been given a December release date for the US - a prime time to be in contention for next year's Oscars. The film starts with Chalamet's Dylan arriving in Greenwich Village, New York, in 1961 with his acoustic guitar in his hand and $12 in his pocket, and ends after he controversially ""went electric"" four years later. In the trailer, Chalamet is seen with Dylan's distinctive tousled hair, performing his 1963 classic A Hard Rain’s a‐Gonna Fall. Director James Mangold - who also made Oscar-winning 2005 Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line - said the actor had been ""brave enough to stand out there and make himself vulnerable, throwing himself at this"". His vocals generally went down well on social media. ""Timmy doing his own singing AND PULLING IT OFF. Color me impressed,"" wrote one user on X. ""Did Timothee sing the songs himself? If yes then incredible, it sounds so much like Dylan. Wow,"" another said. However, some were less impressed. ""That singing ain’t it,"" one wrote. Mangold told Rolling Stone the actors did their own singing - with the proviso that he could fix anything necessary in post-production. ""You want everyone putting everything on the line every moment,"" he said. ""But it’s not [like] if one of our actors hit a bad note, I don’t have an alternative take or the ability to replace that one beat. ""If Timmy’s brave enough to stand out there and make himself vulnerable, throwing himself at this, I should be brave enough to stand behind the camera and shoot. ""And Timmy was a partner in this. He very much wanted to. And the multiple years of preparation that we had on this movie because of false starts with Covid and stuff meant that Timmy really had a kind of incubation as a musician that was years in happening."" A Complete Unknown follows Dylan's rise to fame, as the artist who revolutionised American music with his personal and poetic folk-rock songs. Mangold said he was attracted to ""this idea of a talent like Bob, so vexing, so provocative, so filled with fiction and fact"". ""This idea of this incredible, artistic character landing in New York with $12 in his pocket - trying to thread the needle of how one goes from there to there is so interesting to me,"" he said. The director got the blessing of the real Dylan, who is listed as an executive producer. Chalamet has already starred in two of the biggest films of the past year - Wonka and Dune: Part Two. The 28-year-old could now be in contention for his second Oscar nomination, after being nominated for his breakthrough film, Call Me by Your Name, in 2018. The cast of A Complete Unknown also includes Edward Norton as folk legend Pete Seeger and Monica Barbaro as singer Joan Baez. Dylan has previously been played on screen by Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw and Marcus Carl Franklin - all in the 2007 film I'm Not There.",2024-07-24 23:10:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7e2pg00ndo,Unknown,Unknown,
713,Katy Perry's comeback single falters in charts,"Katy Perry’s comeback has faltered after Woman’s World, the first single from her new album, debuted at number 63 in the US chart and at 47 in the UK. It’s a disappointing return for the pop star, who will release her seventh album 143 in September. As well as being torn apart on social media, Woman’s World – and its video – have been critically panned, with many feeling its feminist messaging is out of touch. The Guardian asked ""what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?"", The Cut stated that ""Perry is stuck in 2016"", and Rolling Stone raised the question: ""Did Katy Perry release the worst comeback single of all time?"" On the song, Perry sings about women being sisters, mothers, champions, winners and superheroes all while being sexy and confident – with a catchy chorus of ""It’s a woman’s world, and you're lucky to be living in it"". The video goes one step further, with Perry (dressed as Rosie the Riveter) and other women dancing around a construction site in tiny outfits. Scenes from the video include the women using urinals, brandishing sex toys, and Perry being hit by an anvil – which prompts her to grow bionic legs. There's also an appearance from YouTuber Trisha Paytas, dragging a monster truck. Later, in a behind-the-scenes video posted on Instagram, Perry explained that the video was meant to be ""satire"", ""slapstick"" and ""very on the nose"". But in her review, the Guardian's Laura Snapes said Perry was struggling to match her pop star peers at the top of the charts, such as Chappell Roan. ""Roan – along with Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx – is modelling how to be a pop star in 2024: they’re inventive, self-aware, silly, deep, some of the qualities Perry had at the peak of her promise but seems to have lost for ever,"" she wrote. Perry has also drawn criticism for working with producer Dr Luke on the single, particularly given that the track is about female empowerment. Fellow singer Kesha sued Dr Luke in 2014, seeking to void their contract because, her lawyers claimed, he had ""sexually, physically, verbally, and emotionally abused [Kesha] to the point where [she] nearly lost her life"". Dr Luke denied the claims. They reached an agreement to settle a years-long defamation lawsuit last year. When Perry announced the collaborators for her new album, Kesha – who has just released her first track as an independent artist – tweeted ""lol"", widely seen as a jibe at her fellow pop star. Kesha was later pictured in a vest top bearing the same message. With 2010 album Teenage Dream, Perry became the first female artist to have five number one songs from the same album on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. She has also had five number one singles in the UK, but these were spread out over a decade - from 2008’s I Kissed A Girl through to Feels, her 2017 collaboration with Calvin Harris, Pharrell Williams and Big Sean. Perry’s last album, Smile, was released in 2020 and - while it had mixed reviews - hit the top five in the UK and US. Its lead single Daisies peaked at number 37 on the UK chart.",2024-07-24 23:10:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkgpwklq1eo,Unknown,Unknown,
719,World breaks hottest day record twice in a week,"The record for the world's hottest day has tumbled twice in one week, according to the European climate change service. On Monday the global average surface air temperature reached 17.15C, breaking the record of 17.09C set on Sunday. It beats the record set in July 2023, and it could break again this week. Parts of the world are experiencing powerful heatwaves including the Mediterranean, Russia and Canada.  Climate change is driving up global temperatures as greenhouse gas emissions released when humans burn fossil fuels warm the Earth's atmosphere. ""While fluctuations are to be expected, as the climate continues to warm, we are likely to keep seeing records being broken, and each new record is taking us further into uncharted territory,"" says Prof Rebecca Emerton, a climate scientist at the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The naturally-occurring climate phenomenon El Niño also added heat to the climate in the first six months of this year but its effects have now waned.  Extreme heat is a serious health hazard, with thousands of deaths attributed to high temperatures every year.  In 2000-2019, almost half a million heat-related deaths around the world occurred each year, according to the World Health Organization. China has issued heat alerts this week, with central and northwestern areas of the country recording temperatures higher than 40C. Russia has been battling wildfires in Siberia, and Spain and Greece also endured days of high temperatures. In the US, more than 40 million people on Tuesday faced dangerous temperatures, and wildfires have broken out in western areas of the country. The global average temperature usually peaks in July or August during summer in the northern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere has large land masses - like the US or Russia - that warm up faster than the oceans that dominate the southern hemisphere. The recent sudden rise in temperatures is also down to significantly-above-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica, according to Prof Emerton. Large swings in temperature are not unusual in Antarctica at this time of year - they also contributed to record temperatures in 2023. Sea ice in the region is almost as low as this time last year, which also leads to above-average sea temperatures in the Southern Ocean. “The hottest day record has been broken once again because the world continues to burn huge amounts of oil, gas, and coal,"" says Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. “Every broken record is a warning that our climate is heating to dangerous levels. These warnings are becoming much more frequent; however, we have all the tools, technology and knowledge to stop things from getting worse – replace fossil fuels with renewable energy and get emissions down to net zero as quickly as possible,"" she added.

738,Whistleblower behind Dujardin video wants to 'save dressage',"This video can not be played Charlotte Dujardin: Video shows Olympian whipping horse The whistleblower who released a video that appears to show Charlotte Dujardin ""excessively"" whipping a horse during a training session did so in a bid to ""save dressage"", says her lawyer. Britain's Dujardin, a six-time Olympic dressage medallist, withdrew from the Paris Games on Tuesday after the video emerged, saying it showed her ""making an error of judgement"". The video, obtained by the BBC, shows Dujardin repeatedly whipping a horse around its legs during the session. After her withdrawal from the Olympics, the 39-year-old was provisionally suspended by equestrian's governing body the FEI, which received the footage on Monday. Dujardin said in a statement: ""What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse. ""I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment."" Speaking to BBC Sport, the whistleblower's lawyer, Stephan Wensing, said his client had mixed feelings about the reaction since the news broke, but she believed it is a widespread issue in dressage. ""It's not fun to ruin a career. She's not celebrating; she doesn't feel like a hero,"" he said. ""But she told me this morning this had to be done because she wants to save dressage."" The Charlotte Dujardin case explained GB's Dujardin given provisional ban and out of Games Equestrian at the Paris 2024 Olympics On Wednesday Dujardin had her UK Sport funding suspended pending the outcome of the FEI investigation, while she has also been dropped as an ambassador for horse welfare charity Brooke, which said it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the video. ""Our whole ethos is around kindness and compassion to horses, and to see the opposite of this from someone with such a high profile is beyond disappointing,"" it said. Two of Dujardin's sponsors, equestrian insurance company KBIS and Danish equestrian equipment company Equine LTS, have removed their backing. Equite LTS said they are ""shocked and saddened by the video"" and ""do not condone this form of behaviour"". KBIS said they ""cannot and will not condone behaviour"" that goes against providing the ""best care possible"" for horses. Dujardin had been set to compete in both the individual dressage and team event alongside Carl Hester and world champion Lottie Fry, on horse Imhotep. She needed a medal of any colour to take the outright lead as most-decorated British female Olympian from now-retired cyclist Dame Laura Kenny. Charlotte Dujardin has been replaced by Becky Moody On Tuesday Dujardin said the video was ""filmed four years ago"", but Wensing said it was from two and a half years ago. ""When she filmed this and was aware of this two and a half years ago, she was thinking everything this superstar, the best rider, is doing, must be OK. This must be the way to train horses and how to deal with it,"" he said. ""Charlotte Dujardin was explaining during the lesson that she wanted the horse lifting the legs up more in canter. ""Later on, [the whistleblower] was thinking 'this is not OK'. She had spoken with several people in the profession and they all warned her 'don’t fight'. ""She was really afraid. There was a sort of fear culture and she was also thinking 'when I do something, it will be victim-blaming'."" The timing of the release of the video has also been questioned, with Madeleine Hill, a former dressage reporter for magazine Horse & Hound, telling the BBC Radio 4 Today programme it felt like ""sabotage"". She believes the FEI should have waited until after the Olympics before imposing any sanctions, adding that ""top riders are being persecuted"" on social media by people who are against the use of horses in sport. However, Wensing said it was the recent removal of a rider from the Denmark dressage team that encouraged his client to report Dujardin. Earlier this month Danish TV station TV2 reported, external that Denmark's reserve rider Carina Cassoe Kruth had been replaced in the Paris squad on the eve of the team announcement after a controversial training video was sent to the Danish Riding Association. Kruth told TV2 she ""deeply regretted"" her ""clear error"". ""Because of the Olympics, [the whistleblower] was thinking if I don't do anything now [Dujardin] will probably win medals,"" Wensing said. ""On the other hand, people are thinking wrong that she could have done this during the Olympics, and that would destroy the whole British team. ""Now the team can organise themselves and use the alternate. It's not like the whole British dressage team has gone now. There could be a worse timing.""",2024-07-24 23:10:57,https://www.bbc.com/sport/equestrian/articles/cw0y240r78qo,Laura Scott,2024-07-24 23:10:57,
737,Dupont inspires France as party starts in Paris,"This video can not be played Watch the tries of the day from the men's rugby sevens pool matches Antoine Dupont underlined why he is one of the faces of the Paris Olympics with a stunning solo try as France secured a spot in the quarter-finals of the men's rugby sevens. While the opening ceremony does not take place until Friday, rugby sevens was chosen as one of the curtain-raising events to get the party started in the French capital. A boisterous and celebratory atmosphere greeted the home players in a near-80,000 crowd in the nation's largest stadium. But France started tentatively with a 12-12 draw against the United States in their opening Pool C match. A joyful mood then turned nervy as Uruguay led their second outing until scrum-half Dupont swung the game in their favour. His scurrying run, demonstrating both his speed and strength, put France 12-7 ahead and laid the platform for Les Bleus to go on and win 19-12. Ireland have joined the hosts in the last eight after winning both of their Pool A matches on the first day of Games action. This video can not be played Dupont try extends France's lead against Uruguay Dupont is a megastar in the 15-a-side ranks, captain of his country and voted 2021 World Player of the Year, and switching to the smaller format has been a huge fillip for the event. The 27-year-old decided to skip the Six Nations earlier this year to prioritise his nation's bid for sevens glory on home soil. After an initially frosty response, that decision appears to have eventually further endeared Dupont to the French public. The biggest sports paper, L'Equipe, lauded him over Wednesday’s front pages,  before an idolising Stade de France crowd  regularly chanted his name. ""The atmosphere was good and helped us to win,"" said Dupont. ""Maybe we did not do our best but hopefully it is going to help us more in the next game. “We need to raise our level. If not, we will not go too far. We need to be focused on the game and not distracted, because we are capable of better."" France are second in the pool, behind Fiji, with five points from their opening two matches. The top two teams from three pools go through to the knockout stage, while the two best third-placed sides also advance. France next play defending Olympic champions Fiji, who beat both Uruguay and the US, in their final pool match on Thursday which means they are assured of qualification. Despite being drawn in what was seemingly a tough pool, Ireland breezed through without the need to beat New Zealand in their final match on Thursday. James Topping's side, which also features 15-a-side converts such as Hugo Keenan, harbours hopes of a medal and illustrated why with an opening 10-5 win over South Africa. That was backed up by an emphatic 40-5 victory over Japan to the delight of the Irish fans present.

736,'Right time' for me to retire - Murray,"This video can not be played Paris 2024: Andy Murray tells BBC sports editor Dan Roan it is the 'right time' to retire from tennis Andy Murray says it is the ""right time"" for him to retire from tennis after the Paris Olympics - and he is ""happy"" with the decision. The two-time Olympic singles champion confirmed on Tuesday the Games, where he will play in the doubles with Dan Evans, will be his final event. Murray, 37, said recent injuries, which prevented him playing singles in his Wimbledon farewell earlier this month, mean he is now content with ending his career. ""I didn't feel that way a few months ago when I thought that this is when I was going to stop,"" said the Scot in his first interview since the announcement. ""I didn't want to. Now I want to.  ""I know it is the right time for me."" All you need to know about Paris 2024 How City of Light changed the Olympics Murray, who has been hampered by a series of injuries in recent years, said in February he did not plan to play beyond the summer, but did not give an indication of when his final tournament would be. An ankle injury in March and a back issue which required surgery in June put emotional farewells at Wimbledon and the Olympics - titles he won twice in his glittering career - in jeopardy, but he was able to play doubles with his brother Jamie at Wimbledon, where they lost in the first round. Murray said his back issue will likely prevent him from entering the singles in Paris - a decision which must be made before Thursday's draw - but he and Evans are capable of doing ""very well"" in the doubles. ""Me and Dan made the commitment to each other, that is what we will prioritise,"" he added. ""That gives the team and us the best opportunity to get a medal.  ""My back is still not perfect. I didn't feel great in the build-up to Wimbledon and during it. I feel better here."" Evans will still play in the men's singles, along with Cameron Norrie and Jack Draper, while Team GB will also be represented in the doubles by Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury. Either British pair could be drawn against high-profile opponents, including 14-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal and his fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz – the Roland Garros and Wimbledon champion. Murray's final match at Wimbledon was expected to be in the mixed doubles with Emma Raducanu but his fellow Briton pulled out to protect a wrist issue that threatened her campaign in the singles. Speaking for the first time on the incident, Murray said he and Raducanu have not spoken since her withdrawal, but he respected her decision. ""Getting to finish playing at Wimbledon on Centre Court with my brother was unbelievably special,"" he added. ""It is something we never experienced. That wasn't how I planned it, but that is how it ended up and I am really happy about that. I am not frustrated or bitter about it."" Asked about his plans following retirement, Murray said he wanted to spend more time with his family, ""become a scratch golfer"" but would ""love"" to be involved in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics ""in some capacity"". ""I don't know what the rest of my life will look like,"" he added. ""I will still stay in touch with the sport."" Murray famously won Olympic singles gold at London 2012, beating Swiss great Roger Federer on Wimbledon's Centre Court, and then defended his title in Rio de Janeiro four years later. ""Every time I have come to the Olympics it feels totally different [to other tennis events] and I personally love it. For me it has been an amazing experience,"" he said. ""I love being around athletes, being part of the team, representing my country. For me it has been right up there.""

Later on Wednesday, Denmark's Holger Rune, the world number 16, announced his withdrawal because of wrist pain. ""I am really sorry that I will be unable to play the Olympics. It's something I've been looking forward to playing and being a part of,"" Rune said on X. Marketa Vondrousova, silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago, pulled out on Tuesday with a hand injury, while Polish world number seven Hubert Hurkacz also withdrew. Other notable absentees include Britain's Emma Raducanu, world number three Aryna Sabalenka and two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur. But Djokovic, Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz and US Open winner Coco Gauff are all slated to play. The Olympics take place just 13 days after Wimbledon ended and finish three weeks before the US Open begins. The Olympic tennis competition consists of men's and women's singles and doubles, as well as the mixed doubles. Andy Murray is set to compete for Great Britain as he ends his playing career, with Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie also in Paris in singles. Murray will play doubles with Evans, while Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski are real medal contenders in the same event.

732,'Circus' football opener 'pathetic' - Mascherano,"This video can not be played Watch the story of Argentina's game against Morocco that lasted four hours Argentina coach Javier Mascherano has described the chaotic ending to his team's  2-1 loss to Morocco in the men's Olympic football tournament as a ""disgrace"" and ""a circus"". Crowd trouble forced the first football match of Paris 2024 to be suspended for nearly two hours, with the game eventually completed in an empty stadium. With Morocco leading 2-1 Argentina appeared to level the match 16 minutes into second-half injury time, which sparked bottles being thrown on to the turf and a pitch invasion by some supporters in Morocco colours. The referee led both sets of players off the pitch at 16:05 BST, with the match resuming at 18:00 after fans had left the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne. Shortly before restarting, Argentina's equaliser was ruled out for offside following intervention from the video assistant referee (VAR). Morocco held on to their lead across three additional minutes. Former midfielder Javier Mascherano is a two-time gold medallist with Argentina Morocco beat Argentina in game marred by crowd trouble ""I have not been a coach for long, but never in my career as a player have I seen a situation like that,"" said Mascherano, who won gold with Argentina in 2004 and 2008. ""It is a circus. But that is how it is. We cannot control it. I told the boys that now we need to look forward, try to get the six points that will allow us to qualify and that all this should fill us with energy and anger for what we have ahead of us."" For some time the outcome of the match was unclear, with the official International Olympic Committee (IOC) website indicating it had ended. Mascherano said the team captains initially ""decided not to play on"" and that the organiser ""called Fifa"" - world football's governing body - before deciding to restart the match. ""It is a disgrace that this should happen and poison the tournament. This wouldn't even happen in a neighbourhood tournament. It's pathetic,"" he added. ""Beyond the Olympic spirit, the organisation needs to be up to standard and at the moment, unfortunately, it is not."" A statement from the tournament organisers said: ""The football match between Argentina and Morocco at the Saint-Etienne Stadium was suspended due to a pitch invasion by a small number of spectators. ""The match then restarted and was able to conclude safely. Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions.""

730,USA man made Irish citizen after DNA test surprise,"A man from Arizona believes he is one of the first people to be awarded an Irish passport based solely on a DNA test. Prof John Portmann was born in Phoenix in Arizona in the summer of 1963.  But about 60 years later he found out, via a DNA test, that his ancestry is 100% Irish. And Prof Portmann has since been awarded Irish citizenship. As a baby, he was taken into the care of the Sisters of Mercy nuns in Phoenix.  He was then adopted and for most of his life, did not want to know more about his birth parents because he was worried about what he might find.  But just a few years ago, his adoptive sister convinced him to try a DNA test. Prof Portmann told BBC NI that he waited ""about two months"" for the DNA test results. He then received the results via email when he was out for dinner one night. Prof Portmann described how some of the email's content was confusing but a line he ""could understand said you are 100% Irish"". ""I thought it must be a mistake. I thought maybe my little vial got confused with someone else's because I didn't feel Irish. I didn't think I was Irish and 100% as well,"" he said. Prof Portmann found a DNA expert from Canada who he described as a ""DNA detective"" or ""a DNA angel"". She reassured him that it wasn't a mistake. And from then, Prof Portmann said he couldn't stop thinking about Ireland, what his relationship to it might be and about his biological mother and father.  He said: ""Although since childhood I had managed to push the thoughts out of my head, all of a sudden it was impossible to keep them out. I thought about them night and day."" ""That's what really started the whole search,"" he added. ""It was the DNA that revealed my past to me...DNA changed my life,"" Prof Portmann said. And while he is not the first person to find out more about where he came from, he believes he is the first person to be granted Irish citizenship from just a DNA test. And he is pleased to have been given an Irish passport. He told BBC NI: ""The Irish passport is quite special. It's the only one that gives you privileges not only in the EU but also in the UK."" Prof Portmann has met a cousin through the same DNA website. Their biological fathers were brothers. He also found out more of his biological family's history. Prof Portmann described how his father died in 2005, probably with ""no idea that I would ever be able to find out who he was"", and his mother died in 2019. ""I do wonder what she thought, what her life was like"", he said. He said that his mother's family did not know she had a child. ""I guess that she carried great shame with her throughout her life and that's sad,"" Prof Portmann said. But Prof Portmann was able to contact his mother's widower who is still alive.  His mother's widower knew about him and he had told his five daughters, expecting them to be shocked. But one of them also said she knew about their mother's other child. He described how when his mother ""knew that she was dying and the end was near, she gave this young woman a picture of me."" His mother asked her to put the picture of him into her hands so that she would be buried with a picture of him. Prof Portmann described how ""it's a nice feeling"" to know that his mother never forgot him.  ""It could be that... maybe she might have had me and just sort of moved on with her life, and tried not to think about me as I tried very hard not to think about her,"" he said.  ""But it is wonderful to know that she did think about me."" ",2024-07-24 23:10:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ve28453gpo,Unknown,Unknown,
