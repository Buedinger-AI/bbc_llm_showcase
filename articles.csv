0,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  A source close to Ms Harris told BBC News she would continue to hit the road on behalf of the campaign. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

1,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, suggests that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June found that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 12:44:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 01:44:08,Unknown
2,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees, and was nearly hit by a falling tree myself. A full-length mirror was lying next to my car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

3,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. It has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 12:44:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 11:44:08,Unknown
4,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 12:44:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 10:44:08,Unknown

6,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 03:44:09,Unknown
7,How to pull off an election all-nighter,"Hello there election enthusiasts! I love the idea of a full night of election drama - sitting up in front of the television, the BBC News live page updating on my laptop, slowly converting a mountain of snacks into a wasteland of empty wrappers and mainlining unseemly quantities of tea.  But we’re fighting biology here, fellow election-night crew. So I’ve been chatting to sleep experts to come up with the definitive guide to getting through the night and not becoming a sleep-deprived monster the next day.  I'm going for the hardcore plan - we've got to be up all day Thursday whether that's for work or childcare, then we're watching the whole thing overnight and we're back in the office on Friday.  There's a milder plan too (that we'll discuss at the end) but all the tips here will help you see democracy in action. In an ideal world you need to be well-rested before you even get to Thursday night.  There's no such thing as “sleep banking” ahead of time but if you're already wrecked then it's going to be a struggle. The core of our plan is going to involve a solid nap strategy.  Napping cannot replace the remarkable restorative power of a night’s sleep but it is scientifically proven to boost to alertness and concentration levels - essential for keeping up with the results. “If you’re staying up all night, I’d have a pre-emptive nap before it starts and have another in the middle of the night,” says Dr Allie Hare, a sleep medicine consultant at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London. Nap three is on Friday morning, pre-work or pre-school-run, to get us out of the door, and number four is in the middle of the day.  “There’s a natural lull after lunch so that’s a good time to do it,” says Dr Hare. She thinks the “push through Friday” approach is best for most people in order to avoid completely disrupting their usual sleeping pattern. Nap technique is a delicate art. You’re aiming for 20-30 minutes in order to get a restorative boost, but go any longer and you’ll mess yourself up.  “If you drop into a deeper sleep, coming out of that can leave you really groggy,” says Professor Russell Foster from the University of Oxford. It's called sleep inertia - that feeling when you wake up worse than when you nodded off. Nap-pros have perfected the art of “pre-loading” and this comes expert-recommended. The idea is if you have a coffee immediately before your 20-minute nap (set a timer on your phone) and then the caffeine hits its peak just as the nap ends, you’re perky and ready to go as soon as you wake up. “It’s a good idea,” says Prof Foster. So I'm thinking naps at 21:00 on Thursday, then 02:00, 06:00 and 14:00 on Friday - but make that pattern work for you. You are still going to feel tired, so bright lights are your friends.  During the night, keep the lights on full-whack, and during the day, spend your time outside to trick your brain into thinking you're supposed to be awake. If you want to stay wired throughout the night then the odds are you’re going to need a performance-enhancing drug - hello caffeine!  The drug is a stimulant so it makes you feel less tired and more alert.  But again, we need a plan and we don't want too much. Prof Foster argues for the judicious use of tea and coffee, but would “personally avoid” energy drinks as they are packed with sugar. “You will crash afterwards and go in completely the opposite direction,” he says. However, energy drinks do give you a bigger caffeine hit. You could hunt out a zero-sugar option, but don't go overboard. “Don’t overdose on the caffeine and have palpitations and anxiety,” says Dr Hare. You’re also going to want to leave several hours for the caffeine to wear off so it doesn’t disrupt Friday night's sleep. Put the kettle down by mid-afternoon on Friday. Oh, and remember to keep yourself well-hydrated overnight in order to keep that brain ticking over. Not just coffee - water too.  And whether you're celebrating, commiserating or just along for the ride, booze could be fun. It is not, however, an elite strategy.  “Do not have alcohol involved in any of this - I realise everyone will but the sleep advice is don't, it's just a sedative and it'll make it harder,” says Dr Hare.  You're going to have to accept that disrupting your sleep is going to have a knock-on effect on your hunger hormones.  Your brain will sense levels of the hormone leptin dropping and ghrelin shooting up, and the combined effect is that you will feel the urge to binge.  “You will have cravings and be tempted to send out for pizza and grab the Twixes,” says Prof Foster. “So beware, you’ll be more hungry.”  You can't really dodge this but you can plan for it, surrounding yourself with food focused on protein and slow-release carbohydrates.  Prof Foster suggests protein drinks or unsalted nuts to provide energy without sending blood sugar levels on a rollercoaster of highs and crashes. “As a treat, you could throw some raisins in,” he chuckles. But don't rely on that box of chocolates.  Dr Hare's advice is: “Don’t eat crap all night.”  If you try, she says you will feel “absolutely dreadful”. Well done! You’ve made it through the night. I hate to break it to you - you might not be a very nice person right now. Even one night without sleep alters the brain’s ability to process information and emotions. Classic signs are increased irritability and anxiety, and a loss of empathy. Frustration is also a classic, as well as increased impulsivity. Prof Foster says: “You are just not the normal, nice, measured individual you would otherwise be.” You're going to suffer from negative salience too.  This is where your world-view becomes warped and negative comments and experiences hit harder.  A tired brain also leads to increased risk-taking. Prof Foster says this can make you “more likely to drift into illegal drug use… that’s what your brain does when tired and emotional”.  So yeah, watch out for that. I hope it's clear that you're not really you right now, so you might want to take things easy and avoid any difficult conversations. “You might be thrilled with the result and be disinhibited, or less than happy and more reactive to being provoked,” says Prof Foster.  So think twice about having 'that' conversation and save life-changing decisions until later. “You certainly need to be sensitive to those difficult conversations,” says Prof Foster. Also - do not drive.  After an all-nighter, if you need to get somewhere, then walk, take a taxi or use public transport.  By four or five in the morning your brain is as impaired as if you had enough booze to be over the drink-drive limit. “Big decisions, meaningful marital conversations and driving - do not do any of these things,” says Dr Hare. Shift workers may be laughing their way through this piece thinking, “What a bunch of lightweights!” If you had a long run-up you could try shifting your body clock so you're awake at night and asleep for the day, but it's probably too late for that now.  Some people do attempt a different strategy to the all-nighter, though.  The idea is to stay up to watch the exit-poll projections, which give you the first hint of the result when it is released at 22:00.  Then have a sleep for a few hours while the ballots are being counted, and wake up early in the morning to catch the peak of the action.  This does hit the problem of sleep inertia we mentioned earlier, but Prof Foster says older people will find this easier to pull off. Sleep patterns change as we age and older people will “have more fragmented sleep” so it is easier for them to wake and feel okay.  On the other hand, young people who are woken by an alarm “feel groggy and crap”. “People will know what works for them,” he says. The other idea is to sleep on Friday morning if you don't have any commitments.  Just be careful you don't KO all day and then can't sleep on Friday night, throwing your whole weekend out of kilter.  Dr Hare says: “If you do have to make major decisions then get whatever sleep you can, even if it messes up your following night's sleep, otherwise power-nap through it.” So good luck, brave election adventurers - whatever you do, you should be fine by Monday. See you on the other side! ",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c047gr9mgxxo,"James Gallagher,",2024-07-04 04:44:09,Unknown

9,How the BBC reports polling day,"The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election, 4 July. The BBC prepares detailed election guidelines which are written and published for each election, and they include guidance about polling day.  On polling day, the BBC does not report on any of the election campaigns from 06:00 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk, or on social media and other channels. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. The lists of candidates, as well as the manifesto guides, remain available online during polling day. Coverage of what is happening on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather.  It tends to focus on giving information that will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself until the polls have closed. That means no opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until the polls have closed. While the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish ""exit polls"" which includes surveys on how people have said they have voted in the election and may also offer a prediction on the election result based on what voters have said.   The BBC, however, is still able to report on events which are not directly related to the elections; and if there are stories about the mechanics of polling day, especially if they might contain important information to help voters, such as an incident at their local polling station, then that too can be reported, but, of course, with impartiality and editorial justification.  From 22:00 BST, after the close of the polls, the election guidelines no longer apply - but the BBC must still report on the election, of course, with the impartiality requirements set out by both Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines.

11,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 10:44:09,Unknown
12,Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks,"It's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks. Up until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use. But these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono. In 2021, Mr Kono had ""declared war"" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: ""We have won the war on floppy disks!"" Mr Kano has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would ""get rid of the fax machine"".  Once seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change. For instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.  The announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a ""symbol of an anachronistic administration"".  ""The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,"" read another comment on X.  Others comments were more nostalgic. “I wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,” one user wrote. Created in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.  A three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information. Sony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.  As part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.  But Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.  Many Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.  People are moving away from those stamps at a ""glacial pace"", said local newspaper The Japan Times. And it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o,"Kelly Ng,",2024-07-04 07:44:09,Unknown
13,Jeff Bezos to sell another $5bn of Amazon shares,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he will sell another 25 million shares in the technology giant, worth nearly $5bn (£3.9bn). It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off. Mr Bezos stepped down as the company's chief executive in 2021 and is currently its executive chair and remains its largest shareholder. He founded Amazon in 1994 in a garage in Bellevue, Washington, when the internet was still in its infancy. The company started out as an online bookseller, touting the world's largest collection of ebooks. Since then Amazon has become one of the world's leading online retail and cloud computing companies. He also founded the rocket company Blue Origin, which in May sent six customers to the edge of space. Mr Bezos is the world's second richest person, according to the Forbes Billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of around $214bn.",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvm3354qo,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 06:44:09,Unknown

15,Australian senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 08:44:09,Unknown
16,'Meat assaults' - Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at frontlines positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-04 01:44:09,Unknown

18,India's X alternative Koo to shut down services,"Millions of social media users in India are stranded after homegrown microblogging platform Koo, which had branded itself as an alternative to X, announced it was shutting services. The platform's founders said a shortage of funding along with high costs for technology had led to the decision.  Launched in 2020, Koo offered messaging in more than 10 Indian languages. It gained prominence in 2021 after several ministers endorsed it amid a row between the Indian government and X, which was then known as Twitter.  The spat began after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government asked the US-based platform to block a list of accounts it claimed were spreading fake news. The list included journalists, news organisations and opposition politicians. X complied initially but then restored the accounts, citing ""insufficient justification"".  The face-off continued as the government threatened legal action against the company's employees in India. Amid the row, a flurry of supporters, cabinet ministers and officials from Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) migrated to Koo overnight. Many of them shared hashtags calling for X to be banned in India. By the end of 2021, the app had touched 20 million downloads in the country.  However, the platform has struggled to get funding in the last few years.  On Wednesday, founders Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka said that Koo was ""just months away"" from beating X in India in 2022, but a ""prolonged funder winter"" had forced them to tone down their ambitions.  “We explored partnerships with multiple larger internet companies, conglomerates and media houses but these talks didn’t yield the outcome we wanted,” they wrote on LinkedIn.  “Most of them didn’t want to deal with user-generated content and the wild nature of a social media company. A couple of them changed priority almost close to signing.” In February, Indian news websites had reported that Koo was in talks to be acquired by news aggregator Dailyhunt. But the talks did not succeed. In April 2023, Koo fired 30% of its 260-member workforce as the company faced severe losses and a lack of funding. The founders said they would have liked to keep the app running - but the cost of technology services for that was high and so, they “had to take this tough decision”.",2024-07-04 12:44:09,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced3l44v98do,"Zoya Mateen,",2024-07-04 07:44:09,Unknown

24,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseilles, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 12:44:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-04 01:44:10,Unknown
25,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

26,"Chickens, lost rings and other strange polling day stories","On election day, millions of us will be casting our votes.  Around 150,000 polling station staff will be running 40,000 polling stations across the UK.  Electoral service managers will have woken up at the crack of dawn knowing they won't get anymore sleep until well into Friday after the counting is done. It is a big job and a serious business - but here are a few stories from the lighter side of running elections. We've got used to seeing dogs in polling stations.  Poultry, less so.  Council workers Sara Chane and Lindsey Carroll were at the polling station in Skelmersdale, Lancashire in May 2021 for the local elections when a chicken wandered in. With no accompanying human - and no valid voter ID - Sara and Lindsey began trying to track down the chicken's owner, including enlisting the help of a nearby florists, all while continuing to run the polling station. ""Come in, don't mind the chicken, we told voters,"" says Lindsey.  ""She was very lovely, very friendly,"" adds Sara.  Eventually a family of farmers offered to take the chicken away while it’s rightful owner was tracked down. But minutes later, a five-year-old boy turned up to looking for his pet, who he said was named Matilda. Lindsey says that began a frantic hunt to reunite the boy with Matilda, amid fears the wayward bird had inadvertently been handed to chicken farmers. ""We were panicking at this point,"" says Lindsey. ""Have we given this chicken to someone who is just going to kill her?"" Eventually Matilda was tracked down and reunited with her rightful owners - but not before a little more trauma for the bird. Matilda, it transpired had been placed in a pen with a number of other chickens who had rounded on her and given her a literal hen-pecking. The relieved owners took their pet chicken home and gave her a bath, while Lindsey and Sara carried on with their democratic duties. A few hours later, Matilda's family returned to the polling station with chocolates and a tray of eggs as a thank you for helping them retrieve their fugitive feathered friend. Chickens aren't the only unexpected polling station visitors.  Peter Stanyon, chief executive of Association of Electoral Administrators, recalled one incident from the south-west of England when a voter was on a hunt. Seeing the polling station, they decided the pursuit of democracy was more urgent and rode their horse straight into the polling station. At other times, polling stations can get quiet. Nevertheless clerks find ways of passing the time.  Peter remembers one worker in Merseyside who got in trouble when, during a lull, he volunteered to be a last-minute stand-in Santa Claus for a children's Christmas party in the room above the polling station. He thought he had got away with it but got a shock when the next person to sit on his knee was a council inspector who had come by the polling station to see how things were getting on.  In Wakefield, one woman accidentally dropped her £40,000 engagement ring into the ballot box, along with her ballot paper.  Once sealed, a ballot box cannot be reopened until the election count.  It meant the unfortunate bride-to-be had to turn up at the count hours later and wait for the box to be opened. ""It was a valuable ring,"" says Peter, but ""not more valuable than democracy."" The rule stating that a ballot box cannot be reopened has unfortunate consequences for polling station workers as well as the affianced.  Until about 15 years ago, ballot boxes were closed shut with sealing wax. Occasionally the heat from the wax could lead to smouldering. Polling station workers couldn't open the box to put out the potential flames so instead had to find a way to get liquid into the box to put out the fire without causing too much damage to the votes. Often, the ballot papers aren't damaged by flames, but the voters themselves.  Tom Lynan has been an electoral services manager in West Lancashire for nine years. He says rude words and anatomical drawings on ballot papers are common. During elections for police and crime commissioners, Tom says voters used to like to add Batman or Commissioner Gordon as their second preferences. He also says his sister-in-law once threatened to write spoilers for Game of Thrones episodes on her ballot paper, knowing that he would likely have to read it overnight. Despite that particular challenge, Tom still enjoys his job. He says there is ""pride in being able to facilitate democracy for the people of the borough"".  He says: ""People have protested and fought over the right to vote, and we are the custodians of the process that is the foundation of this country and its values. ""The day before polling day is like Christmas Eve and we are the elves, but rather than presents being delivered it is an election being delivered.""",2024-07-04 12:44:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy008l7d5j4o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-04 04:44:10,Unknown
27,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

28,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been exceptionally warm for this early in the season. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 12:44:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-03 14:44:10,Unknown
29,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at frontlines positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 12:44:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-04 01:44:11,Unknown
30,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",2024-07-04 12:44:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngl45jz1zo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-03 12:44:11,Unknown
31,Gazans seek shelter as Khan Younis exodus continues,"Tens of thousands of Palestinians are seeking shelter and a safe location, as the exodus from Gaza’s second city of Khan Younis continues in response to Israeli military evacuation orders. The UN estimates that 250,000 people in eastern parts of the city are affected by the orders issued on Monday, which suggest Israeli forces are set to re-enter. Reports say an Israeli air strike on Tuesday killed 12 Palestinians in an Israeli-designated humanitarian area to which people have been told to flee. A major hospital in Khan Younis also now stands empty, after all its patients and medical personnel left. Much of the city was destroyed in a long Israeli offensive earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians had moved there to escape another Israeli operation in nearby Rafah. Explosions, shelling and gunfire were also heard throughout Gaza City on Wednesday as Israeli forces continue to battle Hamas and other armed groups in the eastern Shejaiya district for a seventh day. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,950 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Speaking from Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, Louise Wateridge of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) told the BBC that its staff on the ground had been observing the “very chaotic” movement of civilians from eastern Khan Younis. “[It’s] different from previous displacements, when we’ve seen trucks and vehicles loaded up,” she said.  ""There are limited vehicles available, there’s limited fuel, the roads are so dangerous, the situation is so unsafe. People are really at this stage carrying what they can in their hands and moving. It’s devastating.” Marwan, a father of four who has a pregnant wife, told the BBC that it had taken his family three hours to travel about 7km (4 miles) on a donkey-pulled cart from Khan Younis to al-Mawasi, which is inside a Israeli-designated “humanitarian area” that lacks basic services. “We left in a rush, so we couldn’t get all of our luggage and important things,” he said. “I called a friend who resides in al-Mawasi. He told me there is a place next to me and you can come.” He added: “For the bathroom, I have to dig in the sand and the mud and make a big hole.” On Tuesday afternoon, nine members of an extended family who had fled Khan Younis were reportedly among 12 people killed in an Israeli air strike on a residential building in the central town of Deir al-Balah, which is also inside the “humanitarian area”. The Associated Press cited hospital records as saying that Dr Hossam Hamdan, a 62-year-old dermatologist, his wife, their adult son and daughter were among the dead. Four of Dr Hamdan’s grandchildren and the mother of two of them were also killed, along with two other residents of the building and a man who was on the street outside, it added. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was checking the reports. Late on Tuesday, the World Health Organization announced that the European Gaza hospital in eastern Khan Younis was completely empty, after its 320 patients and all of its medical staff left in response to an evacuation order for the surrounding area.  Most of the patients had been referred to Nasser hospital, which was now at full capacity and had a shortage of medical supplies and drugs for surgery, it warned. “European Gaza Hospital - one of the largest referral hospitals in the south - must be protected and made operational immediately. Gaza cannot afford to lose more hospitals,” wrote WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on X, formerly Twitter. An Israeli defence agency said it did not order the European hospital’s patients and staff to leave. But the head of the emergency department said the Hamas-run health ministry had said they should evacuate. A spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in London, Orly Goldschmidt, said the evacuation orders were part of Israel’s efforts to minimise civilian casualties and accused Hamas members of embedding themselves in residential areas. ""We know that they are also hiding in Khan Younis and we want the civilian population to be out of it, so that we won't harm the Palestinian population and only kill Hamas members,” she told the BBC on Tuesday. The IDF has not announced the start of an operation in eastern Khan Younis. But the evacuation orders are seen as a sign that it will be the next area to be re-entered by Israeli troops because they believe Hamas and allied fighters have regrouped there. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said on Monday that it had fired a barrage of about 20 rockets from Khan Younis towards border communities in southern Israel. It was the heaviest such attack from Gaza in months, but no casualties were reported. Another 80,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza are estimated to have been affected by Israeli evacuation orders covering Gaza City’s eastern Shejaiya district, which Israeli troops re-entered last week. Medics told Reuters news agency that four people had been killed in an air strike there on Wednesday, while the IDF said it had struck and dismantled more than 50 “terrorist infrastructure sites” over the past day. The IDF also said strikes had killed “terrorists who posed a threat” to its troops in central Gaza. Local health officials said three people had been killed in a strike on a car in Deir al-Balah, and that another five had been killed in two strikes in the nearby urban Maghazi refugee camp. In the southernmost city of Rafah, Israeli forces were reported to have shelled several areas in the city and continued to demolish apartment blocks. The IDF said a “targeted” operation was continuing in Rafah and that ground forces backed by aircraft had “dismantled several terror infrastructure sites and eliminated terrorists”.",2024-07-04 12:44:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2wevpg7yo,"David Gritten,",2024-07-03 14:44:11,Unknown
32,Farmer survives crocodile attack by biting back,"An Australian farmer says he is lucky to be alive after repelling a crocodile attack by biting back at the animal. Cattle producer Colin Deveraux has spent a month in hospital after being bitten by the 3.2m (10ft) saltwater crocodile in the Northern Territory. He told ABC News he bit the crocodile's eyelid in his struggle to survive. Mr Deveraux said his ordeal began after he stopped at a billabong (lake) while he was travelling to build fencing near the Finniss River last month. He paused by the lake after noticing fish swimming in the middle of its retreating waters. After he stepped away again, the crocodile ""latched"" onto his right foot, shaking him like a ""rag doll"" and pulling him into the water. Mr Deveraux told ABC he first tried kicking the crocodile in the ribs with his other foot - before biting the reptile back. ""I was in such an awkward position… but by accident my teeth caught his eyelid. It was pretty thick, like holding onto leather, but I jerked back on his eyelid and he let go. ""I leapt away and took off with great steps up to where my car was. He chased me for a bit, maybe four metres, but then stopped."" Mr Deveraux said he used a towel and some rope to stop the bleeding in his leg, before his brother drove him 130km (80 miles) north to the Royal Darwin Hospital. ""If he [the crocodile] had bitten me somewhere else it would have been different,"" he said. ""It means I've got to change what I do. I've been walking around that swamp country too long fixing fences and living life, but it's opened my eyes."" According to the local government, crocodiles are the basis for an important industry in the Northern Territory and are protected by law. They are considered to be of huge scientific and human interest as well as a valuable tourist attraction. The last fatal crocodile attack happened in April this year on the Kennedy River in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland.",2024-07-04 12:44:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-67354430,"Thomas Mackintosh,",2024-07-04 12:44:11,Unknown
33,IVF help for wild rhinos from zoo cousins,"Collecting eggs from a two tonne rhino is far from easy - but the procedure is being carried out in zoos across Europe in a bid to help the wild population. The hope is that cutting-edge fertility technology could boost the genetic diversity of southern white rhinos in Africa. The species was almost extinct, plummeting to a few dozen rhinos  - so the animals are all descended from this tiny group. Scientists believe rhinos in zoos, which have more genetic diversity because they are carefully cross bred, could widen the gene pool with the help of IVF. It’s technology that has seen a recent breakthrough: in January, researchers announced that they had achieved the world’s first rhino IVF pregnancy. One of the animals taking part in the southern white zoo project is 22-year-old Zanta from Dublin Zoo in Ireland.  “Zanta has wonderful genetics that are worth preserving, but we know from a previous reproductive assessment that she can’t breed,” says Frank O’Sullivan, a vet at the zoo. “The main reason we want to do the procedure is to bypass that, harvest her eggs and then they'll be fertilised. The great thing is Zanta will be represented in future generations of rhinos.” A team of fertility specialists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany has flown to Ireland to carry out the procedure. Zanta is anaesthetized with a dart, then once she’s fully sedated the scientists get to work. Amidst the regular beeps of the equipment monitoring Zanta’s vital signs, the researchers cluster around a screen that’s showing an ultrasound of the rhino’s ovaries. She’s been given special hormone injections to help her produce eggs. The researchers are able to locate them inside follicles, small sacs of fluid, that appear as black circles on the screen. Using an ultra-fine needle, and a great deal of precision, they are able to extract the eggs. It’s taken the team a long time to develop this technology. The IVF pregnancy announced in January was in southern whites - with the team successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother. A calf was never born because the mother died from an unrelated bacterial infection early in the pregnancy. However, the scientists believe the pregnancy shows the technique is viable. Their ultimate aim is to repeat this with the southern white rhino’s all but extinct cousin - the northern white rhino - for a project called Biorescue. There are only two of these animals left on the planet - both of them females. But the scientists believe the reproductive advances they’ve made could also help with the southern white rhino’s genetic problems. Today southern whites number in their thousands, but it wasn’t always that way. At the end of the 19th Century, the species was almost wiped out through hunting and land clearance. Some estimates suggest there were as few as 20 animals left. The animals have slowly bounced back and now they are classified as near threatened, but starting off from this very small group has left them with a lack of genetic diversity. This puts them at risk, says Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of reproduction at Leibniz IZW. “If you have a very narrow gene pool, a virus, for example, can jump from one individual to the other because each individual is the same and the immune system acts like the same,” he explained. Southern whites in zoos, on the other hand, have more diversity because of the way their breeding is carefully planned. “We’re trying to apply this new technology to rescue Zanta’s genes and bring them back to Africa, so that we have a wider gene pool for the future,” he says. In a makeshift lab next to the rhino enclosure, the scientists peer intently into a microscope to assess what they’ve collected. Susanne Holtze, part of the Leibniz team, says that they’ve managed to harvest four eggs.   Rhino IVF is still in its infancy - a calf has not yet been born from the technique - but the team is building a store of embryos made with eggs and sperm collected from across Europe and the hope is that they can one day be implanted into surrogates. “It's a lot of effort and in the end we actually come home with a few cells. But these cells have the potential to become embryos and to form a new rhino - a huge two tonne animal, so it’s worth it,” Dr Holtze said. Back in the enclosure, not long after the procedure has been completed, Zanta wakes up. She’s a little unsteady on her feet at first, but once everyone is sure she’s OK, she heads outside. Her keeper calls her name and she soon strolls over for a gentle scratch behind her ears. Although she doesn’t know it, the few eggs that she's donated could make a big difference, helping the survival of future generations of southern white rhinos.

Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 12:44:11,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 19:44:11,Unknown
36,Brazil blocks Meta from using social media posts to train AI,"Brazil has blocked Meta from using Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. It comes weeks after the company abandoned similar plans to use UK and European users' posts for the same purpose. On Tuesday, Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) said it would immediately suspend Meta's latest privacy policy, which allows it to train generative AI models such as chatbots based on posts from its users. A Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was ""disappointed by the decision"", adding that their approach complied with local privacy laws. ""This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,"" the company added. Meta has a significant market in Brazil. There are 102 million Facebook users and more than 113 million Instagram users in the country. The ANPD said it had acted over the ""imminent risk of serious and irreparable damage, or difficulty repairing fundamental rights of the affected [account] holders"".  Meta was given five working days from ANPD's decision to show it has amended its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information found in public posts to train generative AI. If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935). The company's updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU).  Under its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users' information would be used to ""develop and improve"" its AI products.  In Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages. But that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.  On 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a ""step backwards"" for AI in Europe. However Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil. Pedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD's decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta's data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users. Meta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used. Brazil's data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers' posts could be collected and used to train Meta's AI systems, which could be in breach of the country's data protection law. In addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts. The BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts  from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.

37,Ten Hag signs new Manchester United deal until 2026,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has signed a contract extension with the club until 2026. The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth.

38,Australian Senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 12:44:12,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 08:44:12,Unknown
39,Body found in search for child missing in croc attack,"Australian police have found human remains while searching for a 12-year-old they believe was the victim of a crocodile attack. The child was last seen on Tuesday, swimming with family near the remote Aboriginal town of Nganmarriyanga - about a seven-hour drive southwest of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT). “This is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search,” said Senior Sgt Erica Gibson, adding that police would provide support to everyone impacted. Earlier Sgt Gibson had told ABC News that a black crocodile had been seen in the immediate area. As many as 40 members of the community helped police officers in their search for the child, which started shortly after the 12-year-old was reported missing.  They scoured the area by foot, by boat and with the use of helicopters, covering challenging terrain with thick vegetation and a narrow, winding waterway. No details were given on whether the crocodile suspected to have attacked the child had been found. Earlier on Wednesday NT Police Minister Brent Potter said wildlife officers had been authorised to ""remove"" the crocodile from the area once it was located and reiterated the government's safety message. ""We live in a place where crocodiles occupy our water places... it's just a reminder to stay out of the water as best we can."" Found all around the northern edges of Australia - from Broome in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland - saltwater crocodiles were hunted to near extinction but numbers have bounced back since the practice was banned in the 1970s. The NT is now home to an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere else in the world. Attacks though are uncommon. There have been at least two other crocodile attacks in the NT in the past year - a nine-year-old boy was injured in January while swimming in Kakadu National Park, and a farmer escaped a beast's jaws by biting it back in October - but there has not been a fatal attack there since 2018. Queensland, however, has had a series of deadly attacks in recent years, including a 16-year-old boy who was killed in the Torres Strait in April.",2024-07-04 12:44:12,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c729d8e0r09o,"Katy Watson,",2024-07-04 06:44:12,Unknown
40,EU hits Chinese electric cars with steep tariffs,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.",2024-07-04 12:44:12,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 12:02:12,Unknown

We knew United had decided to stick with Ten Hag. We also knew he was about to head into the final year of his contract, which contained an option to extend until 2026. It would have been destabilising - and for Ten Hag probably a bit wearing - to be continually asked about his contract position in the season ahead. It would also send out the wrong message to prospective new signings. It made perfect sense therefore, to trigger the extension.

43,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

Already regarded as the best sprinter of all time, now the Manx Missile has earned the prize he desperately sought with his 35th victory in cycling's greatest race at Saint Vulbas on Wednesday - his 165th career victory. He will be immortalised in the race's history after surpassing Eddy Merckx to become its greatest ever stage winner. In a post on social media Belgian Merckx, who won the Tour five times between 1969-1974, wrote: ""Congratulations Mark for this historic performance. A good guy who has beaten my record on the Tour."" Cavendish had jointly held the record for most Tour stage wins with Merckx since winning his 34th stage in 2021. At the age of 39, surpassing a tally previously considered almost out of reach for any modern-day rider let alone a sprinter, is an achievement that speaks of the longevity and breadth of success of his career. ""The Tour de France is bigger than cycling. I love it, I love racing the Tour,"" Cavendish said. ""Every little detail has been put towards today.""  Cavendish's love affair with the Tour began on 7 July 2008 at Chateauroux - the first of four stage victories in that edition of the race. His breakthrough moment arguably came on the track in 2005, with a world title in the madison, after springing to prominence in the newly-formed British Cycling academy under the supervision of Rod Ellingworth.   But his ability to read a finish, weave into position and produce devastating accelerations have all served to make him formidable in La Grande Boucle. Cavendish knighted in King's Birthday Honours Mark Cavendish is the second-oldest rider to win a Tour de France stage Since drawing level with Belgian legend Merckx in 2021, Cavendish has had to deal with a knifepoint robbery and the uncertainty of finding a new team at the age of 37. There was also the bitter disappointment of leaving the Tour with a broken collarbone 12 months ago, while injuries and depression contributed to him not winning once during 2019 and 2020. Yet here he is in his 15th Tour, displaying the confidence of the rider who was virtually impossible to beat between 2008 and 2012 when he claimed 23 stage wins, including four on the Champs-Elysees. ""Without the Tour de France cycling does not exist,"" Cavendish said in his 2023 Netflix documentary, Mark Cavendish: Never Enough. With 35 victories out of 215 completed stages he also has a strike rate of almost one in six. It is a remarkable feat for a rider who has been described as having a sharp tongue and fiery temper by former team-mates - and as a ""pain in the ass"" by the straight-talking Vasilis Anastopoulos, who worked with Cavendish at Quick Step and is now head of performance at the Manxman’s current Astana Qazaqstan team. The Greek coach has been credited by Cavendish for helping rejuvenate his career during their time together at the Belgian Quick Step team, and for playing a pivotal role in his 2021 and 2022 success at both the Tour and Giro d’Italia. Cavendish's former lead-out man Mark Renshaw is now Astana's sporting director. ""He's amazing. He’s just like a fine wine who gets better and better,"" Renshaw said of the sprinter.   ""The team had so much confidence in him and they had that all year. We've changed the team to look after him and he has been mega committed.  ""I don’t know how many days he's been with his family but this year it has not been many and that is the type of commitment you need."" Mark Cavendish and Peter Kennaugh rode together at Team Sky It was notable to see the sheer number of riders waiting to embrace Cavendish at the conclusion of Wednesday's 177.4 km route from Saint Jean de Maurienne to Saint Vulbas. But when he was struggling in the heat on a brutal opening stage containing over 3,600m of climbing, there had been doubts as to whether this historic win would even be possible. An emotional Anastopoulos said: ""We spent three months in Greece from 2 April, every day believing. On the first day [of the Tour] he had heat stroke so we thought we had done something wrong, but he did it again. ""He was super strong at the end. He was the old Cavendish."" Race leader Tadej Pogacar said at the finish line: ""Incredible. A 35th victory for Mark. I used to watch him on television and we loved him. He came to me and said 'don’t you break my record' - but I don’t think I can."" Speaking on ITV 4, Cavendish's former Team Sky team-mate Peter Kennaugh also gave a glowing tribute to his childhood friend.  ""You can never give up faith in Mark Cavendish. I know this will mean everything to Mark because he is so much more than a sprinter,"" Kennaugh said. ""What he has achieved is not just going down in cycling history but sporting history. It is incredible. ""He thrives off people telling him he can't do it and he's had that his whole career until this very day.  ""This was about much more than modern cycling and what we see every day. It was about passion, dedication and his love for the sport and willingness to never give up."" 2008: Cholet to Châteauroux 2008: Figeac to Toulouse 2008: Lavelanet to Narbonne 2008: Narbonne to Nîmes 2009: Monaco to Brignoles 2009: Marseille to La Grande-Motte 2009: Limoges to Issoudun 2009: Vatan to Saint-Fargeau 2009: Bourgoin-Jallieu to Aubenas 2009: Montereau-Fault-Yonne to Paris 2010: Épernay to Montargis 2010: Montargis to Gueugnon 2010: Sisteron to Bourg-lès-Valence 2010: Salies-de-Béarn to Bordeaux 2010: Longjumeau to Paris 2011: Carhaix to Cap Fréhel 2011: Le Mans to Châteauroux 2011: Blaye-les-Mines to Lavaur 2011: Limoux to Montpellier 2011: Créteil to Paris 2012: Visé to Tournai 2012: Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde 2012: Rambouillet to Paris 2013: Cagnes-sur-Mer to Marseille 2013: Tours to Saint-Amand-Montrond 2015: Livarot to Fougères 2016: Mont Saint-Michel to Utah Beach 2016: Granville to Angers 2016: Arpajon-sur-Cère to Montauban 2016: Montélimar to Villars-les-Dombes 2021: Redon to Fougères 2021: Tours to Châteauroux 2021: Albertville to Valence 2021: Nîmes to Carcassonne 2024: Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne to Saint-Vulbas",2024-07-04 12:44:12,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/articles/cne4m21zkvno,Steven Sutcliffe,2024-07-04 12:44:12,Unknown
45,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Pads Off: Jimmy/Mattchin - listen to the full podcast on BBC Sounds Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

47,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

48,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

49,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago.

50,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:39:19,Unknown
51,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:39:19,Unknown
52,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
53,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown

57,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

58,Israel examining Hamas response to ceasefire plan,"Israel says it is studying a response by Hamas to a Gaza ceasefire plan outlined by President Biden at the end of May. It comes after Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators Egypt and Qatar ""about the ideas"" it has been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until it eliminates Hamas. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC Hamas is no longer insisting on a full ceasefire at the outset of the three-phase plan. President Biden said the plan which he outlined was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal. The first phase would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve a ""permanent end to hostilities"" and the third phase a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and completion of return of dead hostages' remains. A joint statement from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Mossad intelligence agency on Wednesday night said the mediators had ""conveyed to the [Israeli] negotiating team Hamas's remarks on the outline of the hostages deal"". ""Israel is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,"" it added. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Thursday that Hamas has given up the condition of a complete ceasefire in exchange for new conditions related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's southern border area known as the Philadelphi corridor and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of Hamas’s response submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere is positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 37,953 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 10:49:19,Unknown
60,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 08:39:20,Unknown
61,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-03 23:39:20,Unknown
62,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:53:20,Unknown
63,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

64,"Project 2025: The Trump presidency wish list, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  On Wednesday, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted pushback from the Biden campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have renewed attention on the Project 2025 document.  It is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency. But Democrats have taken aim at the Heritage paper, seeking to get campaign value out of some of its more drastic measures.  Last month, Congressman Jared Huffman of California announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. Mr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in an early June statement.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. Trump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-03 21:39:20,Unknown
65,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

66,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 01:39:20,Unknown
67,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:52:20,Unknown
68,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:39:20,Unknown

70,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngl45jz1zo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
71,Revered screenwriter Robert Towne dies aged 89,"Robert Towne, who wrote films including Chinatown and Mission: Impossible, has been remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters following his death at the age of 89. Towne won an Oscar for his 1974 crime and corruption thriller Chinatown, which starred Jack Nicholson as a private detective. He was nominated for four Oscars during his career in total, including for co-writing 1975's Shampoo with the film's star Warren Beatty. Lee Grant, who won best supporting actress for her role in that film, paid tribute to Towne on X. ""His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic & entirely originally [sic],"" she wrote. ""He gave me the gift of Shampoo. He gave all of us the gift of his words & his films. There isn’t another like him. There won’t be again."" Towne also had a high reputation as a script doctor, fixing or adding to existing scripts, such as 1967's Bonnie and Clyde and 1972's The Godfather. Towne often didn't get an official credit, but The Godfather's writer-director Francis Ford Coppola used his Oscars best adapted screenplay acceptance speech to thank him for writing a pivotal and ""very beautiful"" scene between Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's characters in a garden. ""That was Bob Towne's scene,"" Coppola told the 1973 award ceremony. Towne also earned his own Oscar nominations for writing 1973's The Last Detail - also starring Nicholson - and 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. However, he had handed over writing duties on Greystoke and disliked the results so much that he took his name off the credits and used the pseudonym PH Vazak instead. Vazak was the name of his Hungarian sheepdog. Towne had no such qualms about Chinatown, but did admit to having fierce rows with director Roman Polanski throughout the writing and filming process. ""We fought every day, over everything,"" he said. Scott Tobias wrote in the Guardian last month: ""There has been no greater original screenplay in the last 50 years than the one Robert Towne wrote for Chinatown. ""None more elegantly plotted and politically charged, none more literate and historically evocative, none more pungent in its hard-bitten dialogue and sophisticated in its play on noir archetypes."" In 2006, Chinatown was ranked third on a Writers Guild of America list of the greatest screenplays ever - ahead of The Godfather in second and Casablanca in first, meaning Towne had at least a hand in two of the top three. In 2017, Vulture placed him at number three on its list of the best screenwriters of all time. Following his death, the American Film Institute wrote on X: ""From writing masterpieces like Chinatown, Shampoo & countless others, his influence is everlasting."" Towne's Chinatown sequel, The Two Jakes, failed to make the same impact when it was released in 1990. He also wrote 1990 racing drama Days of Thunder and 1993 legal thriller The Firm, both of which starred Tom Cruise. And when Cruise launched the Mission: Impossible film franchise in 1996, Towne co-wrote the first instalment and had the sole writing credit on the second. He also served as both writer and director on a string of films, including 1982's athletics drama Personal Best. The New York Times reported that he had affairs with the film's stars Patrice Donnelly and Mariel Hemingway, leading to the end of his first marriage, to actress Julie Payne. Towne also wrote and directed 1988's Tequila Sunrise, starring Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer; and was credited as a ""consulting producer"" on the 2014-15 season of TV's Mad Men. Towne is survived by his second wife Luisa, and daughters Chiara and Katharine.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g3dy6jdlpo,"Ian Youngs,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
72,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:39:21,Unknown
73,World's oldest cave art found showing humans and pig,"The oldest example of figurative cave art has been discovered in the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi by Australian and Indonesian scientists. The painting of a wild pig and three human-like figures is at least 51,200 years old, more than 5,000 years older than the previous oldest cave art. The discovery pushes back the time that modern humans first showed the capacity for creative thought. Prof Maxime Aubert from Griffith University in Australia told BBC News that the discovery would change ideas about human evolution. “The painting tells a complex story. It is the oldest evidence we have for storytelling. It shows that humans at the time had the capacity to think in abstract terms,” he said. The painting shows a pig standing still with its mouth partly open and at least three human-like figures.  The largest human figure has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod. The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout. It also seems to be holding a stick, one end of which may be in contact with the pig’s throat. The last human-like figure seems to be upside-down with its legs facing up and splayed outwards. It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig’s head. The team of scientists was led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, an Indonesian rock art specialist from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) in Jakarta. He says that that narrative storytelling was a crucial part of early human culture in Indonesia from a very early point in time. “Humans have probably been telling stories for much longer than 51,200 years, but as words do not fossilise we can only go by indirect proxies like depictions of scenes in art – and the Sulawesi art is now the oldest such evidence by far that is known to archaeology,” he said. The first evidence for drawing were found on rocks in the Blombos Caves in southern Africa and dates back to between 75,000 to 100,000 years ago. These consist of geometric patterns.  The new painting, in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, shows representational art – an abstract representation of the world around the person or people that painted it.  It therefore represents an evolution in the thought processes in our species that gave rise to art and science. The question is what triggered this awakening of the human mind, according to Dr Henry Gee, who is a senior editor at the journal Nature, where the details were published. “Something seems to have happened around 50,000 years ago, shortly after which all other species of human such as Neanderthals and the so-called Hobbit died out.  “It is very romantic to think that at some point in that time something happened in the human brain, but I think it is more likely that there are even earlier examples of representational art”. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that there may be examples of ancient representational art in Africa, where modern humans first evolved, but we have not found any yet. “This find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread. “If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge. Obviously this oldest date is work on one panel at one site - hopefully more dating will be done at more sites to confirm this apparently crucial finding”. The new dating was made possible using a new method which involves cutting tiny amounts of the art using a laser. This enables researchers to study different parts of the artwork in greater detail and come up with a more accurate dating. As the new method becomes more widely used, several sites with cave art across the world may be re-dated, possibly pushing back further the emergence of representational art. Until 10 years ago, the only evidence of ancient cave art was found in places such as Spain and Southern France.  It led some to believe that the creative explosion that led to the art and science we know today began in Europe. But the discovery of coloured outlines of human hands in South Suluwesi in 2014 shattered that view Then in November 2018, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh  on the Indonesian Island of Borneo, scientists found the then oldest representational artwork, thought to  be more than 40,000 years old, of an unknown animal. Prof Adam Brumm from Griffith University said that the latest Indonesian cave art discoveries cast new light on the important role of storytelling in the history of art. “It is noteworthy that the oldest cave art we have found in Sulawesi thus far consists of recognisable scenes: that is, paintings that depict humans and animals interacting in such a way that we can infer the artist intended to communicate a narrative of some kind – a story,” he said.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewjq4dxwo,"Pallab Ghosh,",2024-07-03 14:39:21,Unknown

76,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-03 23:39:21,Unknown
77,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:39:21,Unknown
78,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House.

A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

79,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:39:21,Unknown
80,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

81,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 01:39:21,Unknown
82,Australian Senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 06:39:21,Unknown
83,'Almost whole island homeless' in Hurricane Beryl's wake,"Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her. Virtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said. “Union Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,” said Ms Coy in a video message. “There are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.” Fisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed.  “Everything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,” he said. A resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level. “It’s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island – easily 90% – has been erased.” The extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice. “I was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we would make it out at all.” His cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town.  She said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open. “The pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.” “No one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.” An organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien’s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well. Still, he said the community’s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families. “And obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,” he added. Alizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island – from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents. Plus, of course, generators. With power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX. For its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem.  In a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: ""Hurricane Beryl – this dangerous and devastating hurricane – has come and gone and it’s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.” He also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration. On Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope. “I hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they’re able to rebuild the island but I don’t think so”, said Sebastien. “This is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.” Katrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could. “We’re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.” For years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island’s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean.  Heartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl. Beryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h). Thousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. Yet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren’t even worse. “The most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.” “After witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.”",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724x1rjlpno,"Will Grant,",2024-07-03 11:39:21,Unknown
84,Jeff Bezos to sell another $5bn of Amazon shares,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he will sell another 25 million shares in the technology giant, worth nearly $5bn (£3.9bn). It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off. Mr Bezos stepped down as the company's chief executive in 2021 and is currently its executive chair and remains its largest shareholder. He founded Amazon in 1994 in a garage in Bellevue, Washington, when the internet was still in its infancy. The company started out as an online bookseller, touting the world's largest collection of ebooks. Since then Amazon has become one of the world's leading online retail and cloud computing companies. He also founded the rocket company Blue Origin, which in May sent six customers to the edge of space. Mr Bezos is the world's second richest person, according to the Forbes Billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of around $214bn.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvm3354qo,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 04:39:21,Unknown
85,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 10:47:21,Unknown

The head-to-head does favour Katie Boulter a bit more, 6-1. However, their last match in Nottingham was three hours and 13 minutes long, it was quite the epic battle. I'll be very interested and excited to see what sort of battle comes today.  It will be interesting to see how each of them deals with the nerves because there will be an added pressure playing a compatriot and both of them are in exactly the same position.

88,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

89,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

90,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

92,Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United have triggered a one-year extension in Erik ten Hag's contract to keep him at the club until 2026.  The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth. ""With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.” United are in talks with Ten Hag to restructure his backroom staff. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was PSV Eindhoven manager from 2022-23, is expected to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.

93,Sutton's Euro 2024 quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through. Sutton's prediction: 2-1",2024-07-04 11:39:22,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg64lzxqz26o,Chris Bevan,2024-07-04 10:39:22,Unknown
94,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

95,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

96,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But a senior Hamas official privately acknowledged to the BBC, months ago, that they were losing support as a result of the war. And even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. Glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation.  International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:52:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 11:40:57,Unknown
97,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:52:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:52:57,Unknown
98,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. Glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation.  International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:52:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 11:40:57,Unknown
100,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:52:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:52:57,Unknown

102,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:52:58,Unknown

104,Israel examining Hamas response to ceasefire plan,"Israel says it is studying a response by Hamas to a Gaza ceasefire plan outlined by President Biden at the end of May. It comes after Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators Egypt and Qatar ""about the ideas"" it has been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until it eliminates Hamas. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC Hamas is no longer insisting on a full ceasefire at the outset of the three-phase plan. President Biden said the plan which he outlined was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal. The first phase would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve a ""permanent end to hostilities"" and the third phase a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and completion of return of dead hostages' remains. A joint statement from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Mossad intelligence agency on Wednesday night said the mediators had ""conveyed to the [Israeli] negotiating team Hamas's remarks on the outline of the hostages deal"". ""Israel is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,"" it added. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Thursday that Hamas has given up the condition of a complete ceasefire in exchange for new conditions related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's southern border area known as the Philadelphi corridor and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of Hamas’s response submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere is positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 37,953 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

105,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram.

106,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 08:52:58,Unknown
107,EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 09:52:58,Unknown
108,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-03 23:52:58,Unknown
109,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:52:58,Unknown
110,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

111,"Project 2025: The Trump presidency wish list, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  On Wednesday, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted pushback from the Biden campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have renewed attention on the Project 2025 document.  It is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency. But Democrats have taken aim at the Heritage paper, seeking to get campaign value out of some of its more drastic measures.  Last month, Congressman Jared Huffman of California announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. Mr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in an early June statement.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. Trump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-03 21:52:58,Unknown
112,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

113,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 00:52:58,Unknown
114,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:52:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:52:59,Unknown
115,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:52:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:52:59,Unknown
116,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

117,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans?

118,Revered screenwriter Robert Towne dies aged 89,"Robert Towne, who wrote films including Chinatown and Mission: Impossible, has been remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters following his death at the age of 89. Towne won an Oscar for his 1974 crime and corruption thriller Chinatown, which starred Jack Nicholson as a private detective. He was nominated for four Oscars during his career in total, including for co-writing 1975's Shampoo with the film's star Warren Beatty. Lee Grant, who won best supporting actress for her role in that film, paid tribute to Towne on X. ""His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic & entirely originally [sic],"" she wrote. ""He gave me the gift of Shampoo. He gave all of us the gift of his words & his films. There isn’t another like him. There won’t be again."" Towne also had a high reputation as a script doctor, fixing or adding to existing scripts, such as 1967's Bonnie and Clyde and 1972's The Godfather. Towne often didn't get an official credit, but The Godfather's writer-director Francis Ford Coppola used his Oscars best adapted screenplay acceptance speech to thank him for writing a pivotal and ""very beautiful"" scene between Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's characters in a garden. ""That was Bob Towne's scene,"" Coppola told the 1973 award ceremony. Towne also earned his own Oscar nominations for writing 1973's The Last Detail - also starring Nicholson - and 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. However, he had handed over writing duties on Greystoke and disliked the results so much that he took his name off the credits and used the pseudonym PH Vazak instead. Vazak was the name of his Hungarian sheepdog. Towne had no such qualms about Chinatown, but did admit to having fierce rows with director Roman Polanski throughout the writing and filming process. ""We fought every day, over everything,"" he said. Scott Tobias wrote in the Guardian last month: ""There has been no greater original screenplay in the last 50 years than the one Robert Towne wrote for Chinatown. ""None more elegantly plotted and politically charged, none more literate and historically evocative, none more pungent in its hard-bitten dialogue and sophisticated in its play on noir archetypes."" In 2006, Chinatown was ranked third on a Writers Guild of America list of the greatest screenplays ever - ahead of The Godfather in second and Casablanca in first, meaning Towne had at least a hand in two of the top three. In 2017, Vulture placed him at number three on its list of the best screenwriters of all time. Following his death, the American Film Institute wrote on X: ""From writing masterpieces like Chinatown, Shampoo & countless others, his influence is everlasting."" Towne's Chinatown sequel, The Two Jakes, failed to make the same impact when it was released in 1990. He also wrote 1990 racing drama Days of Thunder and 1993 legal thriller The Firm, both of which starred Tom Cruise. And when Cruise launched the Mission: Impossible film franchise in 1996, Towne co-wrote the first instalment and had the sole writing credit on the second. He also served as both writer and director on a string of films, including 1982's athletics drama Personal Best. The New York Times reported that he had affairs with the film's stars Patrice Donnelly and Mariel Hemingway, leading to the end of his first marriage, to actress Julie Payne. Towne also wrote and directed 1988's Tequila Sunrise, starring Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer; and was credited as a ""consulting producer"" on the 2014-15 season of TV's Mad Men. Towne is survived by his second wife Luisa, and daughters Chiara and Katharine.",2024-07-04 11:52:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g3dy6jdlpo,"Ian Youngs,",2024-07-03 11:52:59,Unknown
119,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:52:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:52:59,Unknown
120,World's oldest cave art found showing humans and pig,"The oldest example of figurative cave art has been discovered in the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi by Australian and Indonesian scientists. The painting of a wild pig and three human-like figures is at least 51,200 years old, more than 5,000 years older than the previous oldest cave art. The discovery pushes back the time that modern humans first showed the capacity for creative thought. Prof Maxime Aubert from Griffith University in Australia told BBC News that the discovery would change ideas about human evolution. “The painting tells a complex story. It is the oldest evidence we have for storytelling. It shows that humans at the time had the capacity to think in abstract terms,” he said. The painting shows a pig standing still with its mouth partly open and at least three human-like figures.  The largest human figure has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod. The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout. It also seems to be holding a stick, one end of which may be in contact with the pig’s throat. The last human-like figure seems to be upside-down with its legs facing up and splayed outwards. It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig’s head. The team of scientists was led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, an Indonesian rock art specialist from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) in Jakarta. He says that that narrative storytelling was a crucial part of early human culture in Indonesia from a very early point in time. “Humans have probably been telling stories for much longer than 51,200 years, but as words do not fossilise we can only go by indirect proxies like depictions of scenes in art – and the Sulawesi art is now the oldest such evidence by far that is known to archaeology,” he said. The first evidence for drawing were found on rocks in the Blombos Caves in southern Africa and dates back to between 75,000 to 100,000 years ago. These consist of geometric patterns.  The new painting, in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, shows representational art – an abstract representation of the world around the person or people that painted it.  It therefore represents an evolution in the thought processes in our species that gave rise to art and science. The question is what triggered this awakening of the human mind, according to Dr Henry Gee, who is a senior editor at the journal Nature, where the details were published. “Something seems to have happened around 50,000 years ago, shortly after which all other species of human such as Neanderthals and the so-called Hobbit died out.  “It is very romantic to think that at some point in that time something happened in the human brain, but I think it is more likely that there are even earlier examples of representational art”. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that there may be examples of ancient representational art in Africa, where modern humans first evolved, but we have not found any yet. “This find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread. “If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge. Obviously this oldest date is work on one panel at one site - hopefully more dating will be done at more sites to confirm this apparently crucial finding”. The new dating was made possible using a new method which involves cutting tiny amounts of the art using a laser. This enables researchers to study different parts of the artwork in greater detail and come up with a more accurate dating. As the new method becomes more widely used, several sites with cave art across the world may be re-dated, possibly pushing back further the emergence of representational art. Until 10 years ago, the only evidence of ancient cave art was found in places such as Spain and Southern France.  It led some to believe that the creative explosion that led to the art and science we know today began in Europe. But the discovery of coloured outlines of human hands in South Suluwesi in 2014 shattered that view Then in November 2018, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh  on the Indonesian Island of Borneo, scientists found the then oldest representational artwork, thought to  be more than 40,000 years old, of an unknown animal. Prof Adam Brumm from Griffith University said that the latest Indonesian cave art discoveries cast new light on the important role of storytelling in the history of art. “It is noteworthy that the oldest cave art we have found in Sulawesi thus far consists of recognisable scenes: that is, paintings that depict humans and animals interacting in such a way that we can infer the artist intended to communicate a narrative of some kind – a story,” he said.",2024-07-04 11:52:59,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewjq4dxwo,"Pallab Ghosh,",2024-07-03 14:52:59,Unknown

122,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

123,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But a senior Hamas official privately acknowledged to the BBC, months ago, that they were losing support as a result of the war. And even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. Glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation.  International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 11:41:00,Unknown
124,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:53:00,Unknown
125,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.

126,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:53:00,Unknown
127,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

128,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 00:53:00,Unknown
129,Australian Senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 06:53:00,Unknown
130,'Almost whole island homeless' in Hurricane Beryl's wake,"Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her. Virtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said. “Union Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,” said Ms Coy in a video message. “There are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.” Fisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed.  “Everything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,” he said. A resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level. “It’s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island – easily 90% – has been erased.” The extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice. “I was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we would make it out at all.” His cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town.  She said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open. “The pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.” “No one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.” An organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien’s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well. Still, he said the community’s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families. “And obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,” he added. Alizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island – from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents. Plus, of course, generators. With power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX. For its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem.  In a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: ""Hurricane Beryl – this dangerous and devastating hurricane – has come and gone and it’s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.” He also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration. On Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope. “I hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they’re able to rebuild the island but I don’t think so”, said Sebastien. “This is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.” Katrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could. “We’re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.” For years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island’s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean.  Heartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl. Beryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h). Thousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. Yet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren’t even worse. “The most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.” “After witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.”",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724x1rjlpno,"Will Grant,",2024-07-03 11:53:00,Unknown
131,Jeff Bezos to sell another $5bn of Amazon shares,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he will sell another 25 million shares in the technology giant, worth nearly $5bn (£3.9bn). It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off. Mr Bezos stepped down as the company's chief executive in 2021 and is currently its executive chair and remains its largest shareholder. He founded Amazon in 1994 in a garage in Bellevue, Washington, when the internet was still in its infancy. The company started out as an online bookseller, touting the world's largest collection of ebooks. Since then Amazon has become one of the world's leading online retail and cloud computing companies. He also founded the rocket company Blue Origin, which in May sent six customers to the edge of space. Mr Bezos is the world's second richest person, according to the Forbes Billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of around $214bn.",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvm3354qo,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 04:53:00,Unknown
132,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram.

133,Watch Wimbledon day four: Murrays in action plus all-British battles,"Boulter v Dart Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC TV I've never understood why Harriet Dart doesn't have her ranking higher, I think she is around 100 at the moment but she is such a great athlete. Everything looks very neat and tidy, she moves effortlessly on the court. The area of weakness for her is her second serve. Everyone has talked about it for many, many years, she has talked about it herself.  So she has to try and protect that second serve because that's the area where players will step in and give it a good crack.  She played that incredible match against Katie Boulter in Nottingham which ended 7-5 in the final set. There is quite a little bit of needle between the two of them, I think there always is when you have fellow British players playing up against each other and of course there is a place in the third round at stake so I think it will be what we call a popcorn match. Get ready to watch that one because I think it will be really incredible and they bring different qualities to the court. Harriet will be absorbing the pace, beautiful groundstrokes into the corners and then you've got Katie Boulter with a big serve, big booming heavy groundstrokes. A little bit of a contrast but it is going to make for very, very good watching so I'm looking forward to that one.",2024-07-04 11:53:00,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/live/cx00297vj1vt,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

135,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

136,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

137,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

139,Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United have triggered a one-year extension in Erik ten Hag's contract to keep him at the club until 2026.  The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth. ""With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.” United are in talks with Ten Hag to restructure his backroom staff. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was PSV Eindhoven manager from 2022-23, is expected to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.

140,Sutton's Euro 2024 quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

141,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

142,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

143,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But a senior Hamas official privately acknowledged to the BBC, months ago, that they were losing support as a result of the war. And even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. Glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation.  International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 11:40:41,Unknown
144,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:59:41,Unknown
145,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. Glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation.  International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 11:40:41,Unknown
147,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 22:59:41,Unknown

149,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:59:41,Unknown

While on holiday in Aspen, Colorado with partner Corey Gamble, Jenner broke the news to her daughters, Kendall, Kim and Khloé Kardashian. ""I wanted to tell you guys something because I hadn’t told you yet, but I went to the doctor and I had my scan,"" she said. ""And this just makes me really emotional, but… they found a cyst and like a little tumour on my ovary. ""So I went to the doctor, and Dr A said I have to have my ovaries taken out. And I'm just really emotional about it because they came in handy with you guys. ""It’s also a thing about getting older,"" she added. ""It’s a sign of 'we’re done with this part of your life.'

151,Israel examining Hamas response to ceasefire plan,"Israel says it is studying a response by Hamas to a Gaza ceasefire plan outlined by President Biden at the end of May. It comes after Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators Egypt and Qatar ""about the ideas"" it has been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until it eliminates Hamas. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC Hamas is no longer insisting on a full ceasefire at the outset of the three-phase plan. President Biden said the plan which he outlined was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal. The first phase would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve a ""permanent end to hostilities"" and the third phase a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and completion of return of dead hostages' remains. A joint statement from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Mossad intelligence agency on Wednesday night said the mediators had ""conveyed to the [Israeli] negotiating team Hamas's remarks on the outline of the hostages deal"". ""Israel is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,"" it added. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Thursday that Hamas has given up the condition of a complete ceasefire in exchange for new conditions related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's southern border area known as the Philadelphi corridor and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of Hamas’s response submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere is positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 37,953 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

152,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 10:59:41,Unknown
153,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 07:59:41,Unknown
154,EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.",2024-07-04 11:59:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 09:59:41,Unknown
155,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 11:59:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-03 23:59:42,Unknown
156,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:59:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:59:42,Unknown
157,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

158,"Project 2025: The Trump presidency wish list, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  On Wednesday, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted pushback from the Biden campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have renewed attention on the Project 2025 document.  It is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency. But Democrats have taken aim at the Heritage paper, seeking to get campaign value out of some of its more drastic measures.  Last month, Congressman Jared Huffman of California announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. Mr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in an early June statement.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. Trump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-04 11:59:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-03 20:59:42,Unknown
159,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

160,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:59:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 00:59:42,Unknown
161,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:59:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:59:42,Unknown
162,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:59:43,Unknown
163,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

164,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngl45jz1zo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-03 11:59:43,Unknown
165,Revered screenwriter Robert Towne dies aged 89,"Robert Towne, who wrote films including Chinatown and Mission: Impossible, has been remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters following his death at the age of 89. Towne won an Oscar for his 1974 crime and corruption thriller Chinatown, which starred Jack Nicholson as a private detective. He was nominated for four Oscars during his career in total, including for co-writing 1975's Shampoo with the film's star Warren Beatty. Lee Grant, who won best supporting actress for her role in that film, paid tribute to Towne on X. ""His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic & entirely originally [sic],"" she wrote. ""He gave me the gift of Shampoo. He gave all of us the gift of his words & his films. There isn’t another like him. There won’t be again."" Towne also had a high reputation as a script doctor, fixing or adding to existing scripts, such as 1967's Bonnie and Clyde and 1972's The Godfather. Towne often didn't get an official credit, but The Godfather's writer-director Francis Ford Coppola used his Oscars best adapted screenplay acceptance speech to thank him for writing a pivotal and ""very beautiful"" scene between Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's characters in a garden. ""That was Bob Towne's scene,"" Coppola told the 1973 award ceremony. Towne also earned his own Oscar nominations for writing 1973's The Last Detail - also starring Nicholson - and 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. However, he had handed over writing duties on Greystoke and disliked the results so much that he took his name off the credits and used the pseudonym PH Vazak instead. Vazak was the name of his Hungarian sheepdog. Towne had no such qualms about Chinatown, but did admit to having fierce rows with director Roman Polanski throughout the writing and filming process. ""We fought every day, over everything,"" he said. Scott Tobias wrote in the Guardian last month: ""There has been no greater original screenplay in the last 50 years than the one Robert Towne wrote for Chinatown. ""None more elegantly plotted and politically charged, none more literate and historically evocative, none more pungent in its hard-bitten dialogue and sophisticated in its play on noir archetypes."" In 2006, Chinatown was ranked third on a Writers Guild of America list of the greatest screenplays ever - ahead of The Godfather in second and Casablanca in first, meaning Towne had at least a hand in two of the top three. In 2017, Vulture placed him at number three on its list of the best screenwriters of all time. Following his death, the American Film Institute wrote on X: ""From writing masterpieces like Chinatown, Shampoo & countless others, his influence is everlasting."" Towne's Chinatown sequel, The Two Jakes, failed to make the same impact when it was released in 1990. He also wrote 1990 racing drama Days of Thunder and 1993 legal thriller The Firm, both of which starred Tom Cruise. And when Cruise launched the Mission: Impossible film franchise in 1996, Towne co-wrote the first instalment and had the sole writing credit on the second. He also served as both writer and director on a string of films, including 1982's athletics drama Personal Best. The New York Times reported that he had affairs with the film's stars Patrice Donnelly and Mariel Hemingway, leading to the end of his first marriage, to actress Julie Payne. Towne also wrote and directed 1988's Tequila Sunrise, starring Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer; and was credited as a ""consulting producer"" on the 2014-15 season of TV's Mad Men.

166,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:59:43,Unknown
167,World's oldest cave art found showing humans and pig,"The oldest example of figurative cave art has been discovered in the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi by Australian and Indonesian scientists. The painting of a wild pig and three human-like figures is at least 51,200 years old, more than 5,000 years older than the previous oldest cave art. The discovery pushes back the time that modern humans first showed the capacity for creative thought. Prof Maxime Aubert from Griffith University in Australia told BBC News that the discovery would change ideas about human evolution. “The painting tells a complex story. It is the oldest evidence we have for storytelling. It shows that humans at the time had the capacity to think in abstract terms,” he said. The painting shows a pig standing still with its mouth partly open and at least three human-like figures.  The largest human figure has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod. The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout. It also seems to be holding a stick, one end of which may be in contact with the pig’s throat. The last human-like figure seems to be upside-down with its legs facing up and splayed outwards. It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig’s head. The team of scientists was led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, an Indonesian rock art specialist from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) in Jakarta. He says that that narrative storytelling was a crucial part of early human culture in Indonesia from a very early point in time. “Humans have probably been telling stories for much longer than 51,200 years, but as words do not fossilise we can only go by indirect proxies like depictions of scenes in art – and the Sulawesi art is now the oldest such evidence by far that is known to archaeology,” he said. The first evidence for drawing were found on rocks in the Blombos Caves in southern Africa and dates back to between 75,000 to 100,000 years ago. These consist of geometric patterns.  The new painting, in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, shows representational art – an abstract representation of the world around the person or people that painted it.  It therefore represents an evolution in the thought processes in our species that gave rise to art and science. The question is what triggered this awakening of the human mind, according to Dr Henry Gee, who is a senior editor at the journal Nature, where the details were published. “Something seems to have happened around 50,000 years ago, shortly after which all other species of human such as Neanderthals and the so-called Hobbit died out.  “It is very romantic to think that at some point in that time something happened in the human brain, but I think it is more likely that there are even earlier examples of representational art”. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that there may be examples of ancient representational art in Africa, where modern humans first evolved, but we have not found any yet. “This find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread. “If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge. Obviously this oldest date is work on one panel at one site - hopefully more dating will be done at more sites to confirm this apparently crucial finding”. The new dating was made possible using a new method which involves cutting tiny amounts of the art using a laser. This enables researchers to study different parts of the artwork in greater detail and come up with a more accurate dating. As the new method becomes more widely used, several sites with cave art across the world may be re-dated, possibly pushing back further the emergence of representational art. Until 10 years ago, the only evidence of ancient cave art was found in places such as Spain and Southern France.  It led some to believe that the creative explosion that led to the art and science we know today began in Europe. But the discovery of coloured outlines of human hands in South Suluwesi in 2014 shattered that view Then in November 2018, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh  on the Indonesian Island of Borneo, scientists found the then oldest representational artwork, thought to  be more than 40,000 years old, of an unknown animal. Prof Adam Brumm from Griffith University said that the latest Indonesian cave art discoveries cast new light on the important role of storytelling in the history of art. “It is noteworthy that the oldest cave art we have found in Sulawesi thus far consists of recognisable scenes: that is, paintings that depict humans and animals interacting in such a way that we can infer the artist intended to communicate a narrative of some kind – a story,” he said.",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewjq4dxwo,"Pallab Ghosh,",2024-07-03 14:59:43,Unknown

169,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

170,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But a senior Hamas official privately acknowledged to the BBC, months ago, that they were losing support as a result of the war. And even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. Glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation.  International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-04 11:40:43,Unknown
171,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 22:59:43,Unknown
172,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

173,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

174,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:59:43,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:59:43,Unknown

176,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:59:44,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 00:59:44,Unknown
177,'Almost whole island homeless' in Hurricane Beryl's wake,"Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her. Virtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said. “Union Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,” said Ms Coy in a video message. “There are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.” Fisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed.  “Everything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,” he said. A resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level. “It’s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island – easily 90% – has been erased.” The extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice. “I was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we would make it out at all.” His cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town.  She said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open. “The pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.” “No one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.” An organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien’s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well. Still, he said the community’s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families. “And obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,” he added. Alizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island – from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents. Plus, of course, generators. With power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX. For its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem.  In a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: ""Hurricane Beryl – this dangerous and devastating hurricane – has come and gone and it’s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.” He also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration. On Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope. “I hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they’re able to rebuild the island but I don’t think so”, said Sebastien. “This is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.” Katrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could. “We’re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.” For years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island’s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean.  Heartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl. Beryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h). Thousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. Yet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren’t even worse. “The most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.” “After witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.”",2024-07-04 11:59:44,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724x1rjlpno,"Will Grant,",2024-07-03 11:59:44,Unknown
178,Major safety incident linked to Kevin Campbell death,"Serious concerns over the hospital care of former Arsenal and Everton footballer Kevin Campbell have been flagged up by a health trust, an inquest has heard. Mr Campbell, 54, died at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) on 15 June after being admitted a month earlier. Coroner Zak Golombek said Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the hospital, had declared a Level 5 patient safety incident - the most serious category - about aspects of his care. He said the provisional cause of death given for Mr Campbell was multi-organ failure due to a heart infection. No family members were present at Manchester Coroner's Court as Mr Golombek outlined background details during Thursday's inquest opening. He said that Mr Campbell had been admitted to MRI on 15 May. ""He had been reported to have been fit and well until around January 2024, when he had a number of admissions to hospital before this final admission,” he said. Mr Golombek said the health trust declared a Level 5 incident related to a delay in aspects of Mr Campbell's care and diagnosis, and concerns over decision-making processes concerning palliative care. Mr Golombek said the trust was conducting internal investigations and there would be extra evidence including the investigation report, witness statements from clinicians and a statement from Mr Campbell's next of kin. He said: ""I have also received notification from the trust that a medical cause of death can be offered and, therefore, I will consider evidence from the clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care as to the cause of his death. ""The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis."" He said final determinations on the medical cause of death and the care received by Mr Campbell ""will be made as part of the inquest process"". Proceedings have been adjourned for a hearing at a later date. Mr Campbell’s 24-year-old son Tyrese, who plays for Stoke City, tweeted at the time of his father’s death that ""the pain of this is indescribable and as a son you look at your dad as invincible”. ""He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone."" Kevin Campbell scored 148 goals in 542 appearances in a career involving eight clubs. He won four major trophies with Arsenal and also played for Leyton Orient, Leicester, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, Cardiff and West Bromwich Albion.

179,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

182,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

183,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

184,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

186,Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United have triggered a one-year extension in Erik ten Hag's contract to keep him at the club until 2026.  The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ten Hag to remain Man Utd manager after review Man Utd flew to Ibiza to ask me to stay - Ten Hag Football regulator 'won't be good' - Ratcliffe Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth. ""With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.” United are in talks with Ten Hag to restructure his backroom staff. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was PSV Eindhoven manager from 2022-23, is expected to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.  Chief football news reporter Simon Stone The announcement over Erik ten Hag's contract was virtually automatic once it became clear Manchester United had decided to stick with the Dutchman. His existing deal was due to expire in 2025 and it contained an option for an additional year. Ten Hag's terms have not been improved, so all that has happened really is the option has been triggered. Potentially of more significance is the planned arrival of Rene Hake from Go Ahead Eagles and former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has been out of work since quitting as PSV Eindhoven manager in 2023, as part of Ten Hag's revamped coaching team. With Dan Ashworth now in place and putting his name to United's statement in his first public utterances as sporting director, and Omar Berrada taking over as chief executive within a fortnight, the structures will soon be in place that Sir Jim Ratcliffe felt were missing before. Shortly, there will be no excuses for Ten Hag. Any semblance of another eighth-placed finish and he won't even get close to reaching the end of this repackaged new contract.

187,'Head and shoulders above everyone else' - Sutton's quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

188,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball. ""We piled pressure on at the end and it can hopefully click together.” Euro 2024 latest news and updates Euro 2024 fixtures and scores Euro 2024 groups Euro 2024 highlights Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast",2024-07-04 11:59:45,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg645ydk400o,Unknown,2024-07-04 11:59:45,Unknown
