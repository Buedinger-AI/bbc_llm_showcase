0,Israel examining Hamas response to ceasefire plan,"Israel says it is studying a response by Hamas to a Gaza ceasefire plan outlined by President Biden at the end of May. It comes after Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators Egypt and Qatar ""about the ideas"" it has been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until it eliminates Hamas. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC Hamas is no longer insisting on a full ceasefire at the outset of the three-phase plan. President Biden said the plan which he outlined was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal. The first phase would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve a ""permanent end to hostilities"" and the third phase a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and completion of return of dead hostages' remains. A joint statement from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Mossad intelligence agency on Wednesday night said the mediators had ""conveyed to the [Israeli] negotiating team Hamas's remarks on the outline of the hostages deal"". ""Israel is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,"" it added. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Thursday that Hamas has given up the condition of a complete ceasefire in exchange for new conditions related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's southern border area known as the Philadelphi corridor and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of Hamas’s response submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere is positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 37,953 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

1,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 10:49:19,Unknown
2,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

3,Kris Jenner shares plans for removal of her ovaries,"US reality TV star Kris Jenner has spoken emotionally about plans to have her ovaries removed. In scenes during reality show, The Kardashians, the US media personality and businesswoman revealed she was set to have the procedure after doctors found a cyst and a tumour. While on holiday in Aspen, Colorado with partner Corey Gamble, Jenner broke the news to her daughters, Kendall, Kim and Khloé Kardashian. ""I wanted to tell you guys something because I hadn’t told you yet, but I went to the doctor and I had my scan,"" she said. ""And this just makes me really emotional, but… they found a cyst and like a little tumour on my ovary."" ""So I went to the doctor, and Dr A said I have to have my ovaries taken out. And I'm just really emotional about it because they came in handy with you guys. ""It’s also a thing about getting older,"" she added. ""It’s a sign of 'we’re done with this part of your life.' It’s a whole chapter that’s just closed."" Jenner has six children. Kim, Khloé, Kourtney and Rob Kardashian, from her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian. She also has Kendall and Kylie Jenner, from her marriage to Caitlyn Jenner. Kris Jenner added that her biggest achievement was raising her family. ""People often ask me what is the best job you’ve ever had, and I always say mom,"" she said. ""The biggest blessing in my life was being able to give birth to six beautiful kids."" Speaking to the camera, Kim Kardashian empathised with why her mother was upset. ""To have a surgery and remove your ovaries is a really big deal,"" she said. ""I feel really sad for her. I couldn't even imagine being in that situation and how you would feel really scared to be going through that."" Kourtney also agreed, saying she ""would feel the same way"". ""It's like your womanly power,"" she added.  ""It doesn’t mean it’s taking away who she is or what she’s experienced, but I would feel this sentimental feeling of what it’s created."" Kendall added: ""I get that it's sad because they [her ovaries] have brought all her kids into the world, which is totally fair. ""But at the same time, what are we going to use those for anymore? If they're potentially hurting you, let's get them out of there.""",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydv4je6g11o,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-04 10:52:19,Unknown

5,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
6,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:39:19,Unknown
7,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:39:19,Unknown
8,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
9,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

20,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

19,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:39:20,Unknown
18,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

17,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 08:39:20,Unknown
16,"Project 2025: The Trump presidency wish list, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  On Wednesday, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted pushback from the Biden campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have renewed attention on the Project 2025 document.  It is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency. But Democrats have taken aim at the Heritage paper, seeking to get campaign value out of some of its more drastic measures.  Last month, Congressman Jared Huffman of California announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. Mr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in an early June statement.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025.

12,Revered screenwriter Robert Towne dies aged 89,"Robert Towne, who wrote films including Chinatown and Mission: Impossible, has been remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters following his death at the age of 89. Towne won an Oscar for his 1974 crime and corruption thriller Chinatown, which starred Jack Nicholson as a private detective. He was nominated for four Oscars during his career in total, including for co-writing 1975's Shampoo with the film's star Warren Beatty. Lee Grant, who won best supporting actress for her role in that film, paid tribute to Towne on X. ""His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic & entirely originally [sic],"" she wrote. ""He gave me the gift of Shampoo. He gave all of us the gift of his words & his films. There isn’t another like him. There won’t be again."" Towne also had a high reputation as a script doctor, fixing or adding to existing scripts, such as 1967's Bonnie and Clyde and 1972's The Godfather. Towne often didn't get an official credit, but The Godfather's writer-director Francis Ford Coppola used his Oscars best adapted screenplay acceptance speech to thank him for writing a pivotal and ""very beautiful"" scene between Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's characters in a garden. ""That was Bob Towne's scene,"" Coppola told the 1973 award ceremony. Towne also earned his own Oscar nominations for writing 1973's The Last Detail - also starring Nicholson - and 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. However, he had handed over writing duties on Greystoke and disliked the results so much that he took his name off the credits and used the pseudonym PH Vazak instead. Vazak was the name of his Hungarian sheepdog. Towne had no such qualms about Chinatown, but did admit to having fierce rows with director Roman Polanski throughout the writing and filming process. ""We fought every day, over everything,"" he said. Scott Tobias wrote in the Guardian last month: ""There has been no greater original screenplay in the last 50 years than the one Robert Towne wrote for Chinatown. ""None more elegantly plotted and politically charged, none more literate and historically evocative, none more pungent in its hard-bitten dialogue and sophisticated in its play on noir archetypes."" In 2006, Chinatown was ranked third on a Writers Guild of America list of the greatest screenplays ever - ahead of The Godfather in second and Casablanca in first, meaning Towne had at least a hand in two of the top three. In 2017, Vulture placed him at number three on its list of the best screenwriters of all time. Following his death, the American Film Institute wrote on X: ""From writing masterpieces like Chinatown, Shampoo & countless others, his influence is everlasting."" Towne's Chinatown sequel, The Two Jakes, failed to make the same impact when it was released in 1990. He also wrote 1990 racing drama Days of Thunder and 1993 legal thriller The Firm, both of which starred Tom Cruise. And when Cruise launched the Mission: Impossible film franchise in 1996, Towne co-wrote the first instalment and had the sole writing credit on the second. He also served as both writer and director on a string of films, including 1982's athletics drama Personal Best. The New York Times reported that he had affairs with the film's stars Patrice Donnelly and Mariel Hemingway, leading to the end of his first marriage, to actress Julie Payne. Towne also wrote and directed 1988's Tequila Sunrise, starring Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer; and was credited as a ""consulting producer"" on the 2014-15 season of TV's Mad Men. Towne is survived by his second wife Luisa, and daughters Chiara and Katharine.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g3dy6jdlpo,"Ian Youngs,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
14,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngl45jz1zo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
13,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

11,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:53:20,Unknown
10,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-03 23:39:20,Unknown
15,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 01:39:20,Unknown
27,'Almost whole island homeless' in Hurricane Beryl's wake,"Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her. Virtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said. “Union Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,” said Ms Coy in a video message. “There are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.” Fisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed.  “Everything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,” he said. A resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level. “It’s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island – easily 90% – has been erased.” The extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice. “I was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we would make it out at all.” His cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town.  She said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open. “The pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.” “No one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.” An organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien’s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well. Still, he said the community’s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families. “And obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,” he added. Alizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island – from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents. Plus, of course, generators. With power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX. For its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem.  In a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: ""Hurricane Beryl – this dangerous and devastating hurricane – has come and gone and it’s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.” He also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration. On Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope. “I hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they’re able to rebuild the island but I don’t think so”, said Sebastien. “This is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.” Katrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could. “We’re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.” For years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island’s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean.  Heartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl. Beryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h). Thousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. Yet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren’t even worse. “The most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.” “After witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.”",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724x1rjlpno,"Will Grant,",2024-07-03 11:39:21,Unknown

29,Jeff Bezos to sell another $5bn of Amazon shares,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he will sell another 25 million shares in the technology giant, worth nearly $5bn (£3.9bn). It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off. Mr Bezos stepped down as the company's chief executive in 2021 and is currently its executive chair and remains its largest shareholder. He founded Amazon in 1994 in a garage in Bellevue, Washington, when the internet was still in its infancy. The company started out as an online bookseller, touting the world's largest collection of ebooks. Since then Amazon has become one of the world's leading online retail and cloud computing companies. He also founded the rocket company Blue Origin, which in May sent six customers to the edge of space. Mr Bezos is the world's second richest person, according to the Forbes Billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of around $214bn.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvm3354qo,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 04:39:21,Unknown
28,World's oldest cave art found showing humans and pig,"The oldest example of figurative cave art has been discovered in the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi by Australian and Indonesian scientists. The painting of a wild pig and three human-like figures is at least 51,200 years old, more than 5,000 years older than the previous oldest cave art. The discovery pushes back the time that modern humans first showed the capacity for creative thought. Prof Maxime Aubert from Griffith University in Australia told BBC News that the discovery would change ideas about human evolution. “The painting tells a complex story. It is the oldest evidence we have for storytelling. It shows that humans at the time had the capacity to think in abstract terms,” he said. The painting shows a pig standing still with its mouth partly open and at least three human-like figures.  The largest human figure has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod. The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout. It also seems to be holding a stick, one end of which may be in contact with the pig’s throat. The last human-like figure seems to be upside-down with its legs facing up and splayed outwards. It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig’s head. The team of scientists was led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, an Indonesian rock art specialist from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) in Jakarta. He says that that narrative storytelling was a crucial part of early human culture in Indonesia from a very early point in time. “Humans have probably been telling stories for much longer than 51,200 years, but as words do not fossilise we can only go by indirect proxies like depictions of scenes in art – and the Sulawesi art is now the oldest such evidence by far that is known to archaeology,” he said. The first evidence for drawing were found on rocks in the Blombos Caves in southern Africa and dates back to between 75,000 to 100,000 years ago. These consist of geometric patterns.  The new painting, in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, shows representational art – an abstract representation of the world around the person or people that painted it.  It therefore represents an evolution in the thought processes in our species that gave rise to art and science. The question is what triggered this awakening of the human mind, according to Dr Henry Gee, who is a senior editor at the journal Nature, where the details were published. “Something seems to have happened around 50,000 years ago, shortly after which all other species of human such as Neanderthals and the so-called Hobbit died out.  “It is very romantic to think that at some point in that time something happened in the human brain, but I think it is more likely that there are even earlier examples of representational art”. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that there may be examples of ancient representational art in Africa, where modern humans first evolved, but we have not found any yet. “This find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread. “If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge. Obviously this oldest date is work on one panel at one site - hopefully more dating will be done at more sites to confirm this apparently crucial finding”. The new dating was made possible using a new method which involves cutting tiny amounts of the art using a laser. This enables researchers to study different parts of the artwork in greater detail and come up with a more accurate dating. As the new method becomes more widely used, several sites with cave art across the world may be re-dated, possibly pushing back further the emergence of representational art. Until 10 years ago, the only evidence of ancient cave art was found in places such as Spain and Southern France.  It led some to believe that the creative explosion that led to the art and science we know today began in Europe. But the discovery of coloured outlines of human hands in South Suluwesi in 2014 shattered that view Then in November 2018, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh  on the Indonesian Island of Borneo, scientists found the then oldest representational artwork, thought to  be more than 40,000 years old, of an unknown animal. Prof Adam Brumm from Griffith University said that the latest Indonesian cave art discoveries cast new light on the important role of storytelling in the history of art. “It is noteworthy that the oldest cave art we have found in Sulawesi thus far consists of recognisable scenes: that is, paintings that depict humans and animals interacting in such a way that we can infer the artist intended to communicate a narrative of some kind – a story,” he said.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewjq4dxwo,"Pallab Ghosh,",2024-07-03 14:39:21,Unknown
26,Australian Senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 06:39:21,Unknown
21,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

23,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

The head-to-head does favour Katie Boulter a bit more, 6-1. However, their last match in Nottingham was three hours and 13 minutes long, it was quite the epic battle. I'll be very interested and excited to see what sort of battle comes today.  It will be interesting to see how each of them deals with the nerves because there will be an added pressure playing a compatriot and both of them are in exactly the same position.

25,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

31,Sutton's Euro 2024 quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through. Sutton's prediction: 2-1",2024-07-04 11:39:22,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg64lzxqz26o,Chris Bevan,2024-07-04 10:39:22,Unknown
32,Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United have triggered a one-year extension in Erik ten Hag's contract to keep him at the club until 2026.  The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth. ""With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.” United are in talks with Ten Hag to restructure his backroom staff. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was PSV Eindhoven manager from 2022-23, is expected to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.

33,EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 09:52:58,Unknown
34,Major safety incident linked to Kevin Campbell death,"Serious concerns over the hospital care of former Arsenal and Everton footballer Kevin Campbell have been flagged up by a health trust, an inquest has heard. Mr Campbell, 54, died at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) on 15 June after being admitted a month earlier. Coroner Zak Golombek said Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the hospital, had declared a Level 5 patient safety incident - the most serious category - about aspects of his care. He said the provisional cause of death given for Mr Campbell was multi-organ failure due to a heart infection. No family members were present at Manchester Coroner's Court as Mr Golombek outlined background details during Thursday's inquest opening. He said that Mr Campbell had been admitted to MRI on 15 May. ""He had been reported to have been fit and well until around January 2024, when he had a number of admissions to hospital before this final admission,” he said. Mr Golombek said the health trust declared a Level 5 incident related to a delay in aspects of Mr Campbell's care and diagnosis, and concerns over decision-making processes concerning palliative care. Mr Golombek said the trust was conducting internal investigations and there would be extra evidence including the investigation report, witness statements from clinicians and a statement from Mr Campbell's next of kin. He said: ""I have also received notification from the trust that a medical cause of death can be offered and, therefore, I will consider evidence from the clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care as to the cause of his death. ""The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis."" He said final determinations on the medical cause of death and the care received by Mr Campbell ""will be made as part of the inquest process"". Proceedings have been adjourned for a hearing at a later date. Mr Campbell’s 24-year-old son Tyrese, who plays for Stoke City, tweeted at the time of his father’s death that ""the pain of this is indescribable and as a son you look at your dad as invincible”. ""He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone."" Kevin Campbell scored 148 goals in 542 appearances in a career involving eight clubs. He won four major trophies with Arsenal and also played for Leyton Orient, Leicester, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, Cardiff and West Bromwich Albion.

35,'Head and shoulders above everyone else' - Sutton's quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

38,Who could replace Biden as Democratic nominee?,"US President Joe Biden's feeble debate performance last week sent shockwaves across the Democratic party, raising questions about who could replace him on the presidential ticket should he decide to step down.  The move - though unlikely - would create a logistical nightmare, and could set up an ugly inter-party fight among Democrats just months before voters cast their ballots.  But with Democrats expressing panic and confusion over the future of Mr Biden's candidacy, it has led to discussions about whether the president, 81, is the right candidate to face former President Donald Trump in November. Many Democrats noted the importance of defeating Trump when arguing for or against Mr Biden's claim to the party's nomination.  There are a handful of ways the president could be replaced on the ticket, but chances are slim that Mr Biden would vacate his candidacy with just over four months until the election.  But, if he does, here are some the people who might replace him. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is already on the ticket, is an obvious choice to replace Mr Biden.  As vice president, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights after the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v Wade.  Ms Harris has proved to be a loyal ally to the president and fiercely defended his debate performance. After the event, she admitted the president had a ""slow start"" but argued he went on to provide more substantive answers than Trump.  “People can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance,” Harris told CNN Thursday night.  Ms Harris has the strong name recognition that comes from the job of vice  president, but she has struggled with low approval ratings throughout her tenure.  Forty-nine percent of Americans disapprove of Ms Harris, while 39% approve, according to polling averages tracked by FiveThirtyEight.  Ms Harris will also have a prime-time moment that could vault her ahead of the pack of potential presidential contenders when she faces off against Trump's pick for vice president. The BBC's US media partner CBS is scheduled to host a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention in August.   Gretchen Whitmer, the two term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular mid-west Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  California Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the Biden Administration's fiercest surrogates. He frequently appears on cable news networks praising Mr Biden.  But Mr Newsom has political ambitions of his own.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits have said he would be an appealing stand-in for Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  It is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden Administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as Transportation Secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Mr Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The quick repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  The list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.   Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.  Maryland Governor Wes Moore has found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker are often mentioned, as they have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested senate race in a swing-state, has also been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.  A Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama. Though the former first lady has repeatedly said she does not have presidential aspirations.

41,Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks,"It's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks. Up until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use. But these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono. In 2021, Mr Kono had ""declared war"" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: ""We have won the war on floppy disks!"" Mr Kano has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would ""get rid of the fax machine"".  Once seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change. For instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.  The announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a ""symbol of an anachronistic administration"".  ""The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,"" read another comment on X.  Others comments were more nostalgic. “I wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,” one user wrote. Created in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.  A three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information. Sony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.  As part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.  But Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.  Many Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.  People are moving away from those stamps at a ""glacial pace"", said local newspaper The Japan Times. And it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",2024-07-04 12:23:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o,"Kelly Ng,",2024-07-04 05:23:28,Unknown
39,"Nearly 30,000 evacuated from California wildfires","Tens of thousands of people in northern California have been ordered to evacuate as wildfires grow across the state amid a heatwave. Around 28,000 people were told to leave their homes after the Thompson Fire broke out this week, according to reports citing the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).  Dangerously hot, dry and windy weather is expected to continue, with the National Weather Service predicting temperatures could reach 118F (47C) in some areas early next week.  The city of Oroville, near where the Thompson Fire started, cancelled its 4 July fireworks celebration, and officials warned residents not to use fireworks to avoid the risk of starting blazes.  “The last thing we need is somebody who’s purchased fireworks from a local fire stand going out and doing something stupid,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. “Don’t be an idiot, cause a fire and create more problems for us.” Mr Honea said the area had seen four fires within the last couple weeks and cautioned that danger was far from over. “This is a bad fire season,"" he added. Fire season started recently in California and usually runs until October. The size and intensity of fires in the state have grown in recent years.  The amount of burned areas in the summer in northern and central California increased five times from 1996 to 2021 compared to the 24 year period before, which scientists attributed to human-caused climate change. This week, the National Weather Service issued excessive heat and red flag warnings - indicating hot, dry and windy weather - across the state. The agency said “dangerous” temperatures posed a major to extreme risk of heat stress or illnesses. According to CalFire, around two dozen fires that have burned more than 10 acres sparked across the state since the last week of June. The largest one, at nearly 14,000 acres, was in Fresno county. No one has died, and 74 structures across the state have been destroyed or damaged. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Butte County to provide resources. The Thompson Fire started in Oroville, about 70 miles north of the state capital Sacramento, on Tuesday. The city is around 20 miles from Paradise, which was devastated by the Camp Fire in 2018 that killed 85 people. Fires hit the region again in the years following.  As of Wednesday, 28,000 people had been ordered to evacuate the Oroville area, local CalFire spokesman Rick Carhart told the San Francisco Chronicle. The fire as of Thursday was around 3,500 acres and only 7% contained. Oroville City Council member Shawn Webber posted a video on Facebook on Wednesday showing hillsides charred and smoking on both sides of a road in the area. He wrote that firefighters “have done an excellent job protecting us from even more destruction”. California's state parks system said agencies responding to the fire “also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville”.",2024-07-04 12:23:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c10lve5zr81o,"Mallory Moench,",2024-07-04 11:55:28,Unknown
40,"'I'm as happy as I've been in my life,' says aid worker Simon Boas as he faces death","In September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life.  Over the following year, he knitted together his reflections on life into a book - A Beginner's Guide to Dying. The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication. In what he expects to be one of his final interviews, Simon spoke to Emma Barnett on the Today Programme, offering his reflections on life and death as he moved into hospice care.  My pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.   I used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come. It's been such a great bonus, actually.   The book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this.  In some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West.  I spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible.  I spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me.  I've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people.  It does us all good to think about it.  That's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things.  My family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years... All our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone.  And those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective. I hope people will think, ""I'm glad I read that - Simon's story"". And just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone.  You don't need to have been a politician or a mover and shaker or an aid worker or anything in life. All of us make a huge difference.  I love this quote from George Eliot's Middlemarch:  ""The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.” All of us make a huge difference in life. I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different.  If you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future.  All our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward.  We all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are. I love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands.  So, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu.  However, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family. I'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it.  But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready.  As Julian of Norwich said: ""All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.""  Simon Boas expects to move into a hospice on Thursday where he will be spending his final days surrounded by his family.  When the Today Programme checked in with him that morning he was, unsurprisingly, in good spirts.

42,Brazil blocks Meta from using social media posts to train AI,"Brazil has blocked Meta from using Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. It comes weeks after the company abandoned similar plans to use UK and European users' posts for the same purpose. On Tuesday, Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) said it would immediately suspend Meta's latest privacy policy, which allows it to train generative AI models such as chatbots based on posts from its users. A Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was ""disappointed by the decision"", adding that their approach complied with local privacy laws. ""This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,"" the company added. Meta has a significant market in Brazil. There are 102 million Facebook users and more than 113 million Instagram users in the country. The ANPD said it had acted over the ""imminent risk of serious and irreparable damage, or difficulty repairing fundamental rights of the affected [account] holders"".  Meta was given five working days from ANPD's decision to show it has amended its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information found in public posts to train generative AI. If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935). The company's updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU).  Under its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users' information would be used to ""develop and improve"" its AI products.  In Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages. But that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.  On 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a ""step backwards"" for AI in Europe. However Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil. Pedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD's decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta's data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users. Meta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used. Brazil's data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers' posts could be collected and used to train Meta's AI systems, which could be in breach of the country's data protection law. In addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts. The BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts  from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.

43,Major safety incident linked to footballer Kevin Campbell death,"Serious concerns over the hospital care of former Arsenal and Everton footballer Kevin Campbell have been flagged up by a health trust, an inquest has heard. Mr Campbell, 54, died at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) on 15 June after being admitted a month earlier. Coroner Zak Golombek said Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the hospital, had declared a Level 5 patient safety incident - the most serious category - about aspects of his care. He said the provisional cause of death given for Mr Campbell was multi-organ failure due to a heart infection. No family members were present at Manchester Coroner's Court as Mr Golombek outlined background details during Thursday's inquest opening. He said that Mr Campbell had been admitted to MRI on 15 May. ""He had been reported to have been fit and well until around January 2024, when he had a number of admissions to hospital before this final admission,” the coroner said. Mr Golombek said the health trust declared a Level 5 incident related to a delay in aspects of Mr Campbell's care and diagnosis, and concerns over decision-making processes about palliative care. Mr Golombek said the trust was conducting internal investigations and there would be extra evidence including the investigation report, witness statements from clinicians and a statement from Mr Campbell's next of kin. He said: ""I have also received notification from the trust that a medical cause of death can be offered and, therefore, I will consider evidence from the clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care as to the cause of his death. ""The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis."" He said final determinations on the medical cause of death and the care received by Mr Campbell ""will be made as part of the inquest process"". Proceedings have been adjourned for a hearing at a later date. Mr Campbell’s 24-year-old son Tyrese, who plays for Stoke City, tweeted at the time of his father’s death that ""the pain of this is indescribable and as a son you look at your dad as invincible”. ""He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone.""

46,Diddy faces new sexual assault case,"Embattled rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is facing another sexual assault case after a  woman came forward with fresh accusations against him. The complaint filed in New York by former porn star Adria English is the latest of several lawsuits filed against the star in recent months.  Mr Combs, who is one of rap's most successful moguls, has consistently denied all allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse, including the latest ones. The star is now reportedly also the subject of a federal criminal investigation, though there is no sign any charges are imminent, according to NBC News. Mr Combs's legal woes have mounted after accusations made by ex-girlfriend Cassandra ""Cassie"" Ventura in November. Earlier this year, he apologised after footage came to light that showed him attacking Ms Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016. The new case against in New York alleges that Mr Combs ""forced and coerced (Ms English) to engage in sex work for him"" at parties. It also alleges that the rapper threatened to ruin her career if she did not comply. A total of 33 allegations are made against Mr Combs and his associates in Ms English's 114-page filing, which gives an account of events between 2004 and 2009. “No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,” his lawyer told US media. The statement went on to say that ""Mr Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court”. Ms English is the latest in a string of women to make claims against Mr Combs in recent months, following a lawsuit launched by Ms Ventura that was settled by Mr Combs in November for an undisclosed sum.  She had accused him of rape and sexual trafficking over a decade. Mr Combs' team clarified that the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. Various allegations of sexual and physical abuse have been made against the rapper since then. His homes in Los Angeles and Miami, Florida, were raided earlier this year as part of a federal investigation into human trafficking. Mr Combs's team has been notified that he is a subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation, according to NBC News, citing two sources familiar with his legal issues. Details of the reported investigation have not been revealed, and neither federal officials or Mr Combs's legal team have commented on the matter specifically.",2024-07-04 14:54:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gl3z3dvyo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 13:54:49,
47,Ghana chef accused of faking Guinness World Records award,"A Ghanaian chef who claimed to have broken the world record for the longest non-stop cooking by an individual has been arrested over a dispute with his sponsor. Ebenezer Smith held a press conference on Tuesday announcing he was the new world-record holder after cooking continuously for 802 hours and 25 minutes. He presented a certificate purportedly from Guinness World Records (GWR) confirmed him as the record holder. But on Wednesday, a GWR spokesperson told BBC Pidgin the claims were ""not true"" and added that it was ""not our certificate"". In another response to a Ghanaian media outlet, GWR also explained they were not aware of his attempt and that they did not receive an application from him. The chef was arrested by the police shortly after announcing his purported award, over a dispute with his sponsor, the Amadia Shopping Centre, Spintex, in the capital Accra, where he held his cooking marathon in March. They accused him of breaching a contractual agreement by not informing them about the new developments regarding the alleged confirmation of the award. Many Ghanaians have expressed shock and disappointment on social media about the case, which was widely covered when Mr Smith claimed to have broken the record. The chef, who is still in police custody and has not been charged yet, has not commented on the accusations. His unsuccessful record attempt earlier this year attracted the support of several local celebrities. Several Ghanaians have attempted to break Guinness World Records in recent times, including media personality and entrepreneur Afua Asantewaa Aduonum, who attempted the longest singing marathon last year. Earlier this year another chef, Failatu Abdul Razak, attempted the longest cooking marathon in the northern city of Tamale. The current record for longest cooking marathon by an individual is held by Ireland's Alan Fisher at 119 hours, 57 minutes 16 seconds from 28 September-3 October last year, GWR said. It had previously been held by Nigerian chef Hilda Bacci, whose record stood at 93 hours 11 minutes. Her win caused a sensation in Nigeria with people trying to get themselves in the record books by doing things like crying or singing non-stop. She was dethroned by Mr Fisher months after being declared the record holder. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

48,"Chickens, lost rings and other strange polling day stories","On election day, millions of us will be casting our votes.  Around 150,000 polling station staff will be running 40,000 polling stations across the UK.  Electoral service managers will have woken up at the crack of dawn knowing they won't get anymore sleep until well into Friday after the counting is done. It is a big job and a serious business - but here are a few stories from the lighter side of running elections. We've got used to seeing dogs in polling stations.  Poultry, less so.  Council workers Sara Chane and Lindsey Carroll were at the polling station in Skelmersdale, Lancashire in May 2021 for the local elections when a chicken wandered in. With no accompanying human - and no valid voter ID - Sara and Lindsey began trying to track down the chicken's owner, including enlisting the help of a nearby florists, all while continuing to run the polling station. ""Come in, don't mind the chicken, we told voters,"" says Lindsey.  ""She was very lovely, very friendly,"" adds Sara.  Eventually a family of farmers offered to take the chicken away while its rightful owner was tracked down. But minutes later, a five-year-old boy turned up to looking for his pet, who he said was named Matilda. Lindsey says that began a frantic hunt to reunite the boy with Matilda, amid fears the wayward bird had inadvertently been handed to chicken farmers. ""We were panicking at this point,"" says Lindsey. ""Have we given this chicken to someone who is just going to kill her?"" Eventually Matilda was tracked down and reunited with her rightful owners - but not before a little more trauma for the bird. Matilda, it transpired had been placed in a pen with a number of other chickens who had rounded on her and given her a literal hen-pecking. The relieved owners took their pet chicken home and gave her a bath, while Lindsey and Sara carried on with their democratic duties. A few hours later, Matilda's family returned to the polling station with chocolates and a tray of eggs as a thank you for helping them retrieve their fugitive feathered friend. Chickens aren't the only unexpected polling station visitors.  Peter Stanyon, chief executive of Association of Electoral Administrators, recalled one incident from the south-west of England when a voter was on a hunt. Seeing the polling station, they decided the pursuit of democracy was more urgent and rode their horse straight into the polling station. At other times, polling stations can get quiet. Nevertheless clerks find ways of passing the time.  Peter remembers one worker in Merseyside who got in trouble when, during a lull, he volunteered to be a last-minute stand-in Santa Claus for a children's Christmas party in the room above the polling station. He thought he had got away with it but got a shock when the next person to sit on his knee was a council inspector who had come by the polling station to see how things were getting on.  In Wakefield, one woman accidentally dropped her £40,000 engagement ring into the ballot box, along with her ballot paper.  Once sealed, a ballot box cannot be reopened until the election count.  It meant the unfortunate bride-to-be had to turn up at the count hours later and wait for the box to be opened. ""It was a valuable ring,"" says Peter, but ""not more valuable than democracy."" The rule stating that a ballot box cannot be reopened has unfortunate consequences for polling station workers as well as the affianced.  Until about 15 years ago, ballot boxes were closed shut with sealing wax. Occasionally the heat from the wax could lead to smouldering. Polling station workers couldn't open the box to put out the potential flames so instead had to find a way to get liquid into the box to put out the fire without causing too much damage to the votes. Often, the ballot papers aren't damaged by flames, but the voters themselves.  Tom Lynan has been an electoral services manager in West Lancashire for nine years. He says rude words and anatomical drawings on ballot papers are common. During elections for police and crime commissioners, Tom says voters used to like to add Batman or Commissioner Gordon as their second preferences. He also says his sister-in-law once threatened to write spoilers for Game of Thrones episodes on her ballot paper, knowing that he would likely have to read it overnight. Despite that particular challenge, Tom still enjoys his job. He says there is ""pride in being able to facilitate democracy for the people of the borough"".  He says: ""People have protested and fought over the right to vote, and we are the custodians of the process that is the foundation of this country and its values. ""The day before polling day is like Christmas Eve and we are the elves, but rather than presents being delivered it is an election being delivered.""",2024-07-04 14:54:50,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy008l7d5j4o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-04 02:54:50,
49,How the BBC reports polling day,"The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election, 4 July. The BBC prepares detailed election guidelines which are written and published for each election, and they include guidance about polling day.  On polling day, the BBC does not report on any of the election campaigns from 06:00 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk, or on social media and other channels. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. The lists of candidates, as well as the manifesto guides, remain available online during polling day. Coverage of what is happening on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather.  It tends to focus on giving information that will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself until the polls have closed. That means no opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until the polls have closed. While the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish ""exit polls"" which includes surveys on how people have said they have voted in the election and may also offer a prediction on the election result based on what voters have said.   The BBC, however, is still able to report on events which are not directly related to the elections; and if there are stories about the mechanics of polling day, especially if they might contain important information to help voters, such as an incident at their local polling station, then that too can be reported, but, of course, with impartiality and editorial justification.  From 22:00 BST, after the close of the polls, the election guidelines no longer apply - but the BBC must still report on the election, of course, with the impartiality requirements set out by both Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines.

52,England's 'massive opportunity' to shock All Blacks,"Fly-half Marcus Smith will be key to England's hopes of securing a first series win in New Zealand New Zealand v England first Test Date: Saturday, 6 July Kick-off: 08:05 BST Venue: Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin Coverage: Listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds and follow live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app. When England last toured New Zealand 10 years ago, the All Blacks were on top of the rugby world. After winning the World Cup in 2011, Steve Hansen's side were on an extraordinary run that would culminate in back-to-back glory in 2015. A new crop of future All Blacks stars were coming through, while all-time greats like Richie McCaw and Dan Carter were still in their prime. Even without the injured Carter, and despite strong English performances in the first two Tests, the All Blacks eventually secured a 3-0 series win to cement their status as the dominant rugby nation on earth. The landscape is different in 2024. South Africa and France have stolen a march - the Springboks on the pitch and the French off it. The Japanese league has coaxed some great All Blacks into international sabbaticals or international retirements. Covid took its toll. ""It's been a few tough years, there is no doubt about that,"" said New Zealand Rugby Union boss Mark Robinson. The Henry-Hansen-Ian Foster lineage - which ran the All Blacks for 20 years - has been broken up, with the popular former flanker Scott Robertson, 49, now at the helm after guiding the Crusaders to a remarkable seven consecutive Super Rugby titles. ""He has spent a huge amount of time developing his craft,"" said Robinson. ""He's thought really deeply about the role for a long time. It feels this is the time for him."" But despite the excitement around the Robertson era, the New Zealand rugby public - often so bullish - is a little nervous.  The All Blacks haven't played a game since losing the World Cup final last October, while a host of key players including locks Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick, scrum-half Aaron Smith and fly-half Richie Mo'unga are no longer available. With Sam Cane stepping down as captain, second row Scott Barrett will lead the team for the first time, while Damian McKenzie starts at fly-half. ""There is uncertainty about how this team is going to come together,"" explained Liam Napier of the New Zealand Herald. ""I look at this New Zealand squad and there are so many unknowns,"" agreed former England scrum-half Danny Care. ""They don't have the players anymore that you fear. They have players you massively respect, but as a team, do you go there literally with fear? I don’t think New Zealand has that at the moment. ""This is a massive opportunity for England to go down there and shock the New Zealand world."" Perofeta gets All Blacks nod to face England Rugby Union Daily: New Zealand's new era England prop Marler to start against New Zealand Among the local media, England's sharp performances at the back end of the Six Nations and the polished display in the win against Japan in Tokyo have not gone unnoticed. Nor has the continuity in Steve Borthwick's selection or the tweak in playing style since last autumn's World Cup. ""It’s not traditional England - they have evolved,"" said Napier. ""Maybe England have a chance to surprise the All Blacks with their style. ""There is cohesion there and they have named largely the same team. But how is this All Blacks team going to come together? No-one is quite sure."" While Borthwick has had his whole squad in camp for almost four weeks, Robertson has had his together for just 10 days. Leaders like Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett missed the Super Rugby season while playing in Japan.  ""I’m nervous,"" World Player of the Year Savea admitted on Thursday. ""But nerves bring the best out of us. And it's a great challenge for myself to step forward and try and own it."" ""You hope England can maybe catch New Zealand a little bit on the hop,"" said Care. ""There are a lot of things that put the All Blacks in a different space to where they have been in years gone by,"" added former England wing Chris Ashton. Despite all this, England supporters will be cautious in their optimism. The All Blacks still boast some world-class players, whether in the form of the magnificent Savea or the talented Jordie Barrett [the third of the brothers in the matchday squad]. TJ Perenara is back at scrum-half after a two-year absence. Robertson can even afford to leave the great Beauden Barrett out of his starting XV. England’s inexperienced side - the vast majority of whom have never played in New Zealand - will be tested both mentally and physically. It is the All Blacks in New Zealand and it remains - according to Borthwick - the biggest challenge in world rugby. But it nonetheless feels like England have a once-in-a-generation chance of making history, and becoming only the third English side - after 1973 and 2003 - to win a Test in New Zealand. Under Robertson, the All Blacks will only improve going forward. Any cobwebs will be blown away, and quickly.  Next week's second Test is at Eden Park in Auckland, the spiritual home of All Blacks rugby, where their record is incomprehensibly good. For England, Saturday in Dunedin might be a case of now or never.",2024-07-04 14:54:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cleyn3nd72lo,Chris Jones,2024-07-04 14:07:52,
54,Teacher who had sex with two schoolboys jailed,"A teacher who had sex with two schoolboys and became pregnant by one of them has been jailed. Rebecca Joynes groomed both boys from the age of 15, first exchanging messages on social media, Manchester Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old was previously convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of sexual activity with another child. Joynes cried and shook in the dock as she was sentenced to six-and-a-half years.  The trial heard that Joynes was 28 when she had come out of a nine-year relationship and was ""flattered"" by the attention of teenage schoolboys. Neither teenager - known as Boy A and Boy B throughout the trial - can be identified due to their age.  Joynes gave birth to Boy B's baby in early 2024, with the child being taken away from her within 24 hours. In a victim impact statement, Boy B said ""one of the hardest things"" was not being told anything about the baby. He added: ""I struggled to come to terms with my abuse, I was completely in denial."" During the trial, he said he felt he had ""betrayed someone I love and done wrong by giving evidence"" but had since realised ""the full extent"" of the abuse and ""tactics used"".  He said he was ""coerced, controlled, manipulated, sexually abused, and mentally abused"", adding: ""I will forever be Rebecca‘s victim and forever linked to her through our child.""  At the sentencing hearing, the judge, Kate Cornell, told Joynes: ""You were the adult, the person in control.  ""You should have known better. You failed to enforce the boundaries of proper conduct but deliberately transgressed them."" The trial heard Joynes would ""laugh off"" inappropriate comments instead of shutting down the behaviour. She gave Boy A all but one of the digits of her mobile phone number as a maths problem-solving exercise in which he had to work out the final digit. They then connected on Snapchat and he sent her flirtatious texts, with the pair agreeing to meet in secret. Boy A lied to his mother that he was staying at a friend's house after school but instead Joynes picked him up and took him to the Trafford Centre, where she bought him a £350 Gucci belt. Judge Cornell said CCTV footage of Joynes buying the belt showed that ""your flirtatious body language and eye contact could hardly be a clearer indication of grooming behaviour"". Back at her flat Joynes had sex twice with Boy A. The next day the boy's mother noticed a love-bite on her son's neck, which he dismissed as ""nothing"". The court heard she stormed into school reception as police were called in about the case. Joynes was then bailed on condition she would have no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18. She told the trial she then moved back to her parents in Wirral after having a ""breakdown"" and she was at a low point when Boy B messaged her on Snapchat.   He later told police they regularly had unprotected sex at her Salford Quays flat and that Joynes had told him she could not become pregnant.  Joynes was arrested for breaking bail conditions and spent five months in custody until she was bailed in November last year. Boy B said in his statement there had been a ""massive mental toll"" on him and his family.   He said he had been told by social services that Joynes had refused to let them update him about the baby's due date, gender or health.  ""The thought of not being able to see my child was heartbreaking,” he added. Judge Cornell said Joynes was a ""high achiever"" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions. ""You felt buoyed and boosted by their attention,"" she added.  ""There's no real insight from you, you continue to deny the offences and have been silent on the distressing impact on these boys.""   Det Con Beth Alexander, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""School should be a place of safety for children. ""It’s clear from some of the public commentary when Joynes was convicted that there is still a lack of understanding when it comes to men and boys being the victims of sexual offences. ""They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they 'should be happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous. ""Women can still be paedophiles; this term is not reserved only for men. Men and boys can still be victims of sexual abuse.” Additional reporting from PA News.

50,Body found in search for child missing in croc attack,"Australian police have found human remains while searching for a 12-year-old they believe was the victim of a crocodile attack. The child was last seen on Tuesday, swimming with family near the remote Aboriginal town of Nganmarriyanga - about a seven-hour drive southwest of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT). “This is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search,” said Senior Sgt Erica Gibson, adding that police would provide support to everyone impacted. Earlier Sgt Gibson had told ABC News that a black crocodile had been seen in the immediate area. As many as 40 members of the community helped police officers in their search for the child, which started shortly after the 12-year-old was reported missing.  They scoured the area by foot, by boat and with the use of helicopters, covering challenging terrain with thick vegetation and a narrow, winding waterway. No details were given on whether the crocodile suspected to have attacked the child had been found. Earlier on Wednesday NT Police Minister Brent Potter said wildlife officers had been authorised to ""remove"" the crocodile from the area once it was located and reiterated the government's safety message. ""We live in a place where crocodiles occupy our water places... it's just a reminder to stay out of the water as best we can."" Found all around the northern edges of Australia - from Broome in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland - saltwater crocodiles were hunted to near extinction but numbers have bounced back since the practice was banned in the 1970s. The NT is now home to an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere else in the world. Attacks though are uncommon. There have been at least two other crocodile attacks in the NT in the past year - a nine-year-old boy was injured in January while swimming in Kakadu National Park, and a farmer escaped a beast's jaws by biting it back in October - but there has not been a fatal attack there since 2018. Queensland, however, has had a series of deadly attacks in recent years, including a 16-year-old boy who was killed in the Torres Strait in April.",2024-07-04 14:54:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c729d8e0r09o,"Katy Watson,",2024-07-04 03:54:52,

55,Labour set for general election landslide - exit poll,"Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent As they wait for more results, some Conservatives are turning their fury on Rishi Sunak’s inner circle. Shortly before polls closed, Sunak announced a string of honours for former cabinet ministers such as Theresa May and Chris Grayling. He also gave a peerage to Liam Booth-Smith, his chief of staff, and a knighthood to Oliver Dowden, his deputy prime minister. I’ve just had this through from a senior Conservative source: ""There is widespread disgust at the reward for abject failure in Rishi’s dissolution list. Sir Oliver Dowden pushed for an early election and has been the worst DPM in living memory, demonstrating terrible political judgment.  ""Lord Booth Smith is the architect of the Sunak project and connived to bring down the biggest election winning Tory PM in a generation. Sunak’s pledge to bring integrity back to politics when he entered Downing Street has proven to be a total lie. This an utter disgrace."" That gives you a flavour of the recriminations which are beginning right now. Sir Charles Walker, who stood down as a Conservative MP at the election, responded to that quote in our radio studio just now, saying: ""The idea that people in the Conservative Party are going to be as sanguine and magnanimous as I am, is for the birds.""",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn09xn9je7lt,Unknown,Unknown,
56,Starmer set to be PM as Tories face worst defeat - exit poll,"Labour is set to win a general election landslide with a majority of 170, according to an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky. If the forecast is accurate, Sir Keir Starmer will become prime minister with 410 Labour MPs – just short of Tony Blair's 1997 total. The Conservatives are predicted to slump to 131 MPs, their lowest number ever. The Liberal Democrats are projected to come third with 61 MPs.  The Scottish National Party will see its number of MPs fall to 10, while Reform UK is forecast to get 13 MPs, according to the exit poll.  The Green Party of England and Wales is predicted to double its number of MPs to two and Plaid Cymru is set to get four MPs. Others are forecast to get 19 seats. The exit poll, overseen by Sir John Curtice and a team of statisticians, is based on data from voters at about 130 polling stations in England, Scotland and Wales. The poll does not cover Northern Ireland. At the past five general elections, the exit poll has been accurate to within a range of 1.5 and 7.5 seats. If the exit poll is correct it will be a remarkable turnaround for the Labour Party, which had its worst post-war election result in 2019, when the Conservatives under Boris Johnson won an 80 seat majority. The Conservatives may avoid the wipe-out predicted by some opinion polls but they are still set for the worst result in the party's history, losing 241 MPs - a devastating blow after 14 years in government. It will mean a Labour prime minister in Downing Street for the first time since 2010 and a likely battle for the future direction of the Conservatives if, as seems likely, Rishi Sunak stands down as leader.  The Tory losses are likely to have been inflicted by the resurgent Liberal Democrats and Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which looks set to win more seats than many polls predicted.  We will have to wait until the early hours, when the bulk of results start rolling in, to see if the exit poll is accurate.  Labour's predicted landslide would be just short of the 179 majority won by Tony Blair in 1997 and the party may achieve it on a smaller share of the vote than former leader Jeremy Corbyn won in 2017, according to Sir John Curtice. But it will be seen as a vindication of Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to change his party and move it back to the centre ground of British politics. Labour shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson won the Houghton and Sunderland South constituency, in the first result of the night. She said in her victory speech: ""Tonight the British people have spoken, and if the exit poll this evening is again a guide to results across our country as it so often is, then after 14 years the British people have chosen change. ""They have chosen Labour and they have chosen the leadership of Keir Starmer. Today our country with its proud history has chosen a brighter future."" In a pattern that looks set to be repeated throughout the night, the Reform UK candidate in the north-east England constituency came second ahead of the Conservative by a large margin. The Liberal Democrats are, meanwhile, set to squeeze the Tory vote in the south of England, where a number of Conservative cabinet members, including Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, are looking vulnerable. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""It looks like this will be our best result for a generation."" Rishi Sunak had insisted he could still win right to the end despite failing to make a dent in Labour's commanding opinion poll lead over the six-week campaign.  Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told BBC Radio 4: ""This is a very difficult moment for the Conservative Party."" He said he was ""very sorry"" that the exit poll is projecting that a number of his colleagues will lose their seats. On keeping his own seat, he says ""we will have to wait and see"". On Wednesday - the day before the election - Mr Stride made headlines when he admitted he thought it was likely there would be a massive Labour majority, effectively conceding defeat. Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""not a good night"" for the SNP, which is predicted to lose 38 seats, adding that she believed the prediction would be ""broadly right"". Rishi Sunak surprised many in his own party by announcing a summer election. But his campaign was hit by a series of gaffes, from the rain-drenched announcement in Downing Street to his decision to leave a D-Day celebration in Normandy early to record a TV interview and confused messaging about a Labour ""super majority"".",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xnzlzz99o,"Brian Wheeler,",2024-07-04 21:10:05,
57,"What's happening in UK election, and what comes next?","Voting has ended and Britain’s Labour Party is projected to have won the UK’s general election with a landslide victory. If the projection based on exit polls is correct, Sir Keir Starmer’s centre-left party will return to power with a large majority after 14 years of right-wing government under the Conservatives. And Mr Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who only entered Parliament in 2015, will become the new UK prime minister on Friday after seeing the King at Buckingham Palace. Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, meanwhile, will have led the Conservatives to their worst result in decades. Exit polls are not official results but they have proved increasingly accurate since the mid-1990s. Now comes the process of confirming the official result. It will be a long night of vote counting and there will undoubtedly be plenty of storylines to follow along the way. Here's what you can expect, and what it means. Like we said, the exit poll is not an official result but has in recent elections been a very reliable indicator of who will form the new government.  The UK runs a parliamentary system with 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of these represents an individual constituency - basically an area – somewhere in the country. The exit poll projects Labour to win 410 seats, the Conservatives 131, the centrist Liberal Democrats 61 and Reform UK (a successor to the Brexit Party) on 13. Other parties and independents will take the rest of the seats. This result would give Labour a huge 170-seat majority.  Right now, election officials in each constituency are busy counting votes, and at some point in the evening will declare their results. Whoever gets the most votes wins and becomes the MP for the area. Some local areas pride themselves on being among the first in the country to announce their winners. Houghton and Sunderland South was the first - returning Labour MP Bridget Phillipson - who is expected to become education secretary in the next government. The announcement of results – often held in school halls – are usually televised. All candidates in a constituency – including those running as a joke – are present on stage. So, on that note, watch out for Count Binface, who is challenging Mr Sunak in his northern English constituency. But perhaps of more political significance will be some of the senior Conservatives who will lose their seats.  Steve Baker, a cabinet minister, and Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader, are projected to have a less than 1% chance of keeping theirs. Jeremy Hunt, who serves as chancellor - the UK's equivalent of a finance minister - has a less than 20% chance. Grant Shapps, the defence minister, and Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, could also lose their seats. That all depends. It will come when it's clear which party will hit the magic number of 326 seats. That figure represents a majority in parliament, meaning the party has enough MPs to be able to pass laws without needing the help of any other party. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister, after the King officially invites them to form a government. The leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes what’s known as the leader of the opposition. If the incumbent prime minister loses, the changeover is quick, compared with many other countries. So if this exit poll is correct, Mr Sunak will probably be out of 10 Downing Street – the UK equivalent of the White House -  within a day, with Mr Starmer installed soon after. In late May, facing a significant deficit in the polls, Rishi Sunak surprised many in his own party as well as political pundits by deciding to call a snap election, triggering a six-week election campaign. The Conservatives have held power since 2010 and the country has seen five leaders in that time – including a tumultuous period in 2022 when the UK had three prime ministers in a matter of weeks. For its part, Labour hasn’t won a general election since 2005 and its last result in 2019 under left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn was its worst for almost a century. Keir Starmer sought to show voters during the campaign that the party had moved on, while calling for a change in government after a long period of Conservative government. Mr Sunak, meanwhile, tried to sell the record of his party, and repeatedly warned voters against handing Labour a large majority.",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v0e074jejo,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-04 22:35:05,
58,Sir John Curtice: Understanding the exit poll numbers,"Labour have likely secured their anticipated landslide victory, though the party may have fallen just short of the majority Tony Blair won in the 1997 general election. They may have achieved this on a smaller share of the vote than former leader Jeremy Corbyn secured in 2017. Both the Conservative share of the vote and their seat tally could be the lowest in the party’s history. Their seat tally might be affected by their vote falling more heavily in seats where they were previously strongest - a pattern that is largely because support for Reform has risen most there. To add to the Conservatives’ travails, the rise in Labour support is stronger in seats where the party started off second to them. Equally, the Lib Dems have performed especially well in seats where they started second to the Conservatives - and particularly in ones the party held until 2015. It is these patterns that, above all, help explain why the Conservative seat tally is expected to be so low. It appears the Conservatives have suffered heavily in places where more than a third of households have a mortgage – a reflection perhaps of the damage caused by former prime minister Liz Truss’s “fiscal event"". It looks as though Reform UK may win more seats than many polls suggested. This is largely because the Conservative vote has fallen far in seats they previously held, but also because Reform have advanced most in seats where more people voted Leave in 2016. This is especially the case in seats being defended by the Conservatives. Reform are also inevitably advancing more strongly in seats that the Conservatives won in 2017 - where the Brexit Party did not stand in 2019. However, how many seats Reform will win is highly uncertain. Our model suggests there are many places where they have a chance - but a relatively low one - of winning. Meanwhile, Labour’s vote is up more in seats where a large part of the population say they are in bad health - a measure of relative deprivation - and in places where more people voted Leave in 2016. The party also seems to be advancing strongly in Scotland but less well in Wales, where they have held power in the Senedd since 2021. While the Lib Dems are doing relatively well in seats where they start second to the Tories, conversely their vote has been squeezed somewhat in places where the Conservatives were facing a challenge from Labour. They also appear to be doing better in places with a relatively high Leave vote, which was one of Ed Davey’s objectives. The Greens are performing particularly well in places where the population is relatively young. Their success in these places may help to explain why Labour’s share of the vote nationally might be less than 40%. The Greens may still only pick up two or three seats, despite recording their highest-ever general election vote share because of its even distribution across the country. In Scotland, it appears the SNP have suffered a more substantial reverse than was anticipated by most polls. Though the decline in the party’s support appears to be lower in places where a high proportion of people identify as Scottish rather than British. The exit poll only has a small number of sampling points in Scotland. If the poll has even slightly overestimated Labour’s advantage over the SNP, the latter’s tally could end up being higher. The forecast for the SNP - and for Scotland in general, where the exit poll is pointing to substantial Labour gains - must thus be treated with a great deal of caution.",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2x0g8nkzmzo,"Sir John Curtice,",2024-07-04 22:10:05,
64,Hurricane Beryl leaves Jamaican homes without power,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica remain without power in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - swept along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night, bringing more than 12 hours of heavy rain. Officials and residents are assessing the damage after an island-wide curfew was lifted early on Thursday. Beryl, which has now weakened to a category three storm, is headed for Mexico and the Cayman Islands. It left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, killing at least 10 people. St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Venezuela reported three deaths each, while one person died in Jamaica.  The storm destroyed almost every home on two small islands in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Jamaican energy provider JPS said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” King Charles III, who is also monarch in several Caribbean nations, said on Thursday he was ""profoundly saddened to learn of the dreadful destruction"" left by Hurricane Beryl. The UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. Beryl became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

59,Israel tells Gaza ceasefire negotiators to resume work,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to send a team of negotiators to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas. US President Joe Biden welcomed the development, which comes a day after Hamas responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan he outlined in late May. The last indirect talks took place in Cairo earlier that month. Details of Hamas's latest response have not been made public, but a Palestinian official told the BBC that the group was no longer demanding a full ceasefire at the outset of the plan presented by Mr Biden. A senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to ""pretty significant adjustments"" to its position. ""We've had a breakthrough on a critical impasse,"" the US official said, although he stressed that ""this does not mean this deal is going to be closed in the period of days"".  President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu held a phone call on Thursday, which focused on the hostages and ceasefire negotiations, the official said.  On Wednesday, Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators from Egypt and Qatar about ideas it had been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting, until it eliminates Hamas. When he announced the plan on 31 May, President Biden said it was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal, and that it involved three phases. The first would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third phase the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. After the two leaders' phone call on Thursday, the Israeli government said in a statement: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu updated President Biden on his decision to send a delegation to continue the hostage negotiations and reiterated the principles that Israel is committed to, especially its commitment to end the war only after all of its goals have been achieved."" Mr Netanyahu has declared his objectives to be the return of all remaining hostages, the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensuring Gaza no longer constitutes a threat to Israel.  The White House said Mr Biden ""welcomed the prime minister's decision to authorise his negotiators to engage with US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an effort to close out the deal"". A source in the Israeli negotiating team meanwhile told Reuters news agency that Hamas's response included ""a very significant breakthrough"" and that there was ""a deal with a real chance of implementation"". A senior Palestinian official told the BBC earlier on Thursday that Hamas had given up the demand for a complete ceasefire. Its new conditions, the official said, related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from a strip of land running along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of the response Hamas submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere was positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he is “committed to the Israeli proposal welcomed by President Biden”, although he has not publicly endorsed the outline as it was laid out. The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,010 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.  Hamas and allied armed groups are believed to still be holding 116 hostages who were taken on 7 October. At least 42 are presumed by Israeli authorities to be dead. The others have been released, rescued or their bodies recovered. Four other Israelis have been held hostage since 2014 and 2015, two of whom are presumed dead.

60,Violent attacks shock France ahead of crunch vote,"A growing number of candidates and activists in France have been targeted with violent or verbal attacks in the run-up to Sunday's tense final round of parliamentary elections. Government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot was putting up election posters with her deputy and a party activist in Meudon, south-west of Paris, when they were brutally assaulted by a gang of youths. Other election campaigners have come under attack across France, reflecting the febrile mood in politics with the far-right National Rally (RN) the front-runner in the election. The motive for the attack on Ms Thevenot and her colleagues is not clear, but she returned to Meudon on Thursday with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who condemned ""attacks of intolerable cowardice"". Images filmed from a block of flats showed the youths swarming around the candidate, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist for President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble alliance. Ms Thevenot told Le Parisien website that when she and her colleagues objected to the youths defacing party posters ""they immediately attacked one of my activists, injuring Virginie"". Ms Lanlo suffered an arm injury, while the activist was punched and hit with a scooter, ending up with a broken jaw. The car windscreen was also smashed by the scooter. Three teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested by police and the incident was quickly condemned across the political spectrum.  Mr Attal called on people to ""reject the climate of violence and hatred that's taking hold"", while RN leader Jordan Bardella said one of his ""big commitments as prime minister"" would be to ""combat record insecurity and repeat offending"". Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has announced that 30,000 police will be deployed across France for Sunday's vote in an attempt to prevent ""the ultra-left or ultra-right"" from stirring up trouble.  The BBC spoke to voters in his constituency in northern France on Thursday who said they feared youths would go on the rampage whoever won, to express their anger at the political system. Law and order is one of RN's big priorities, alongside immigration and tax cuts to target the cost-of-living crisis. RN candidates have also come under attack. Marie Dauchy described being ""violently assaulted"" as she campaigned at a market in La Rochette near Grenoble in the south-east.  A conservative candidate allied with RN, Nicolas Conquer, complained that he and a female colleague had been pelted with eggs. And last month another RN candidate was treated in hospital after he was set upon while handing out pamphlets. Having won 33.2% of the vote in the first round of the snap election, called out of the blue by President Macron, Mr Bardella's party is now aiming to win an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.  But his political opponents have agreed to do all they can to block the far right from winning enough seats to form a government. Seventy-six seats were won outright in the first round by candidates who won more than half the local vote in their constituency, including 39 RN candidates and their allies. The other 501 seats will be settled in run-off votes, and 217 third-placed candidates have pulled out of the race to hand a rival a better chance of defeating RN. Of those 217 withdrawals, 130 candidates came from the left-wing New Popular Front and 81 from the Macron alliance. Marine Le Pen has complained bitterly about the operation to secure ""mass withdrawals"", and blamed those who sought to ""stay in power against the will of the people"". However, she said she thought there was still a chance of winning an absolute majority, if the electorate turned out in big numbers. The latest Ifop poll suggests RN will win 210-240 seats, short of the 289 it needs to form a government. That is down on the 240-270 range of seats that it was estimated to win after the first round. Nevertheless there is fear among some of France's minorities of what RN might do if it gets into power. It aims to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing and to abolish the right to automatic French citizenship for children of foreign parents, if those children have spent five years in France from the age of 11 to 18. Dual citizens would also be barred from dozens of sensitive jobs. One Muslim woman in a district that voted 54% for RN last Sunday told the BBC that RN was gaining ground with every election that took place. On the eve of France's quarter-final tie against Portugal in the European Championships in Germany, national football captain Kylian Mbappé called on voters to ""make the right choice"". After Sunday's ""catastrophic"" first-round results, he said ""we can't put the country into the hands of those people"", without specifying who they were.",2024-07-04 23:10:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngxeyxd9go,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-04 20:10:06,
61,All you need to know about election night,"Settle in, folks - it’s going to be a long night. Our election night watcher’s guide includes key timings and the pivotal seats you should watch out for as we wait to find out who will be the next prime minister. We’ll also be telling you where you can watch, listen and read everything you need to know about the results from across the BBC. So if you’re staying up, we hope you’ve got Friday booked off and you’re stocked up on snacks and coffee. Now make yourself comfortable. This is the first big moment of the night. Voters in more than 130 constituencies are polled across the country on behalf of broadcasters. The results allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won across Britain. The exit poll isn’t always exactly right, but more often than not it gives a good indication of where we’re heading. The result is being projected on the BBC’s London HQ, Broadcasting House. Staying up past then? We’ve got you covered. Online: Follow all the election developments and results on the BBC News website and app, where we’ll be running a live page through the night with analysis from correspondents and experts. TV: The BBC’s Election 2024 programme with Laura Kuenssberg, Clive Myrie and Chris Mason begins on BBC One and BBC News at 21:55 BST. You can also keep up to date by tuning in to the BBC News Channel and the Election 2024 livestream on BBC iPlayer. There will also be dedicated results programmes in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Sunderland used to be famous for getting the first result out but this year it could come from nearby Blyth and Ashington, a new seat. This is traditional Labour territory but includes towns where voters have switched to the Tories in recent years. The important thing to watch out for here will be the size of any swing towards Labour, which will provide the first bit of hard data pointing to how the party has performed nationally. Remember, all result timings are estimates and could change. Radio: Check in with Nick Robinson, Rachel Burden and Henry Zeffman on Radio 4 and 5 Live. The Newscast podcast team are hosting a watch-along with 150 listeners at the BBC's London HQ. A special edition of the podcast will be available on Friday morning. Listen here. Not many results are due in around midnight - can you resist the urge to go to bed during this lull? There could be an early eye-catching result in Swindon South, where Labour hope to unseat former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. That would be ominous for Rishi Sunak - and he’ll also be concerned if the Liberal Democrats make an early breakthrough in Harrogate and Knaresborough. Starting to feel those first flickers of tiredness? Well, it’s about to start picking up. The big result to look out for is Darlington, which the Tories took from Labour in 2019 under Boris Johnson. Similarly, watch out for Wrexham at around 01:30. To put it simply, if Labour isn’t winning this sort of place back, it probably isn’t winning. In Basildon and Billericay, we’ll find out if Conservative Party chairman Richard Holden’s relocation to this usually safe Tory seat has paid dividends for him. Keep your eyes peeled for Rutherglen, which is due to be the first result from Scotland. We’ll start to find out if pro-independence voters have stuck with the SNP, stayed at home or switched to Labour. Online: Remember, you can see all the results online and they will be updated throughout the night. International users can access all BBC News election content on BBC.com. Boris Johnson won a string of seats in traditional Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England in 2019 on a promise to “get Brexit done”.  Watch out for places like Bolsover, West Bromwich and Hartlepool. They'll start to give us a sense of whether the Conservatives have held on to these so-called red wall constituencies or whether Labour has won them back. If you’re reading this shortly after polls close and wondering what time to wake up in order to see the big moments, this would be a good time to set your alarm for. According to BBC polling guru Prof Sir John Curtice, an eventual result could be forecast by broadcasters around this time in the event of a landslide. It wouldn’t be official - it would just mean that based on the results so far, the BBC and others might feel confident enough to ""call it"". Between 02:30 and 03:00, we’re expecting the pace of declarations to really pick up - so if you’ve got to get up for work soon, walk away now while you still can. Watch for Na h-Eileanan an Iar - this island constituency off Scotland’s west coast might have the smallest population of any in the UK, but it will give us an early sign of whether Labour are breaking through north of the border. In Northern Ireland, the performance of the DUP could be the story of the night. Party leader Gavin Robinson is facing a strong challenge from Naomi Long, the leader of the Alliance Party, in Belfast East, while in South Antrim, the Ulster Unionist Party thinks it has a good chance of returning to Westminster by beating the DUP. The DUP is also under pressure from Alliance in Lagan Valley, which is the seat formerly held by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who resigned as DUP leader earlier this year when he was charged with historical sex offences, which he denies. That result is due a bit later. If you’re staying up, get some coffee and strap in - because if alarm bells aren’t already ringing for one of the two main parties, they soon will be. Bellwether seats like Nuneaton and Stevenage are hotly contested places which have switched between Labour and Tory. The party that wins in Dartford has gone on to form a government at every election since 1964. Keep an eye on Scarborough and Whitby too. In short, if Labour are winning these seats, they‘re likely to be on for a comfortable majority - and if they’re not, then the pollsters may want to keep a low profile for a while. Sir Keir Starmer will be watching from Holborn and St Pancras, where his result is due at around the same time as his predecessor’s. Jeremy Corbyn will be learning his fate down the road in Islington North, where he is standing as an independent. Also watch Chingford and Woodford Green, where Labour’s attempt to unseat former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has been complicated by its former candidate Faiza Shaheen running as an independent.  Then there is Rochdale, where we'll find out if ex-Labour MP George Galloway’s recent by-election victory was a temporary protest vote or if he’s there to stay. In Wales, a good night for Plaid Cymru would mean holding on to their seats in west Wales - which, because of boundary changes, would mean beating Rishi Sunak’s chief whip Simon Hart in Caerfyrddin - and taking Ynys Môn from the Tories. They’re due around this time. If you’re still with us by this stage, then in the words of Chris Mason, you clearly ooze stamina. Now it’s going to get hectic. About one fifth of all the results are due to be announced in a 30-minute window from 03:30. Attention will turn to senior Tories in seats where pre-election polls suggested they could lose. Watch for: There may be some high drama in Surrey, where Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is being pushed by the Lib Dems in Godalming and Ash. A sitting chancellor has never lost their seat but if things are going really badly for the Tories, that could change. Elsewhere, we'll get a sense of how the Lib Dems and Greens are doing. Both Wimbledon and South Cambridgeshire are key Lib Dem targets, but the party will need a much bigger swing to win somewhere like Chichester, which is Education Secretary Gillian Keegan’s seat. If they win there, they’re having a very good night. In Bristol Central, Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer has one of the party’s best chances of taking a new seat. The party’s other leader, Adrian Ramsay, will hope to win in Waveney Valley - though we’re not expecting that result until closer to 04:30. Rishi Sunak’s constituency Richmond and Northallerton isn’t due to declare until around this time, by which time his party’s fate may already be sealed. This could well be the first time in the evening we hear him speak. Reform UK has shaken up this election but will it make it into the Commons? At around 04:00, we’ll find out if Nigel Farage has won in Clacton, a race that marks his eighth attempt to become an MP. Two other big Reform targets are due around that time, too - Richard Tice in Boston and Skegness and Lee Anderson in Ashfield. Elsewhere, the picture in Scotland should be pretty clear after the Glasgow results are through. The SNP will feel it has weathered the storm if it limits any losses there - but Labour wins in Glasgow South and Glasgow West could indicate a real shift across the country. Winning back Gordon Brown’s old seat Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy from the SNP would be a big symbolic moment for Labour, and the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn will hope to prevent any revival in Aberdeen South. Noticed that strange glowing light at the window? That’s the sun coming up. If you’re still awake by now, give yourself a big pat on the back. By the time it’s light, we are likely to know who will form the next government, because enough seats should have been declared for a party to pass the 326 seats needed for a majority. In the event of a Labour landslide or a very comfortable win, we could already have reached that point earlier in the night, closer to 04:00. If the Tories have defied the polls or the election is close, it could come later. If you are still up by now, you are either: a) extraordinarily caffeinated or, b) Professor Sir John Curtice. Either way, you have earned your election night stripes. Mercifully, there should be a bit of a breather around this time as the pace of results slow - but there are some big ones still to come. Deciding to run in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East led to Douglas Ross announcing he will quit as leader of the Scottish Conservatives due to internal party anger over his attempt to serve in Westminster and Holyrood at the same time. We’re due to find out if it was worth it. Johnny Mercer is another high-profile Tory figure facing a tough challenge. Labour hope to take his Plymouth Moor View seat at around this point in the morning. At around 05:30, we’re expecting to get Liz Truss’s result in South West Norfolk. People who went to bed after the exit poll will be waking up to a set of results that is more or less complete, with counting only continuing in very close seats or ones that started late for logistical reasons. If things have gone badly for the Tories, we could still see some big names losing their seats at this point - for example, Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker in Wycombe and Jonathan Gullis, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, in Stoke-on-Trent North. Whatever the result, the focus will now start moving to victory speeches, recriminations, resignations and what the new government will look like. Results night might be over, but really, the big stuff is just beginning - so if you’ve been with us all night, for goodness sake, go to bed.

62,'Meat assaults' - Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 23:10:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:10:06,
63,Exit poll: What is the forecast in my area?,"The Labour Party is forecast to win a landslide majority in Parliament, according to an exit poll published as voting ended in the 2024 general election. Labour is set to take 410 seats, well ahead of the Conservatives on 131, according to the forecast based on the poll carried out by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. This suggests Labour is on course for a majority of 170 seats, although they may have fallen just short of the majority Tony Blair won in 1997. The Liberal Democrats are currently forecast to win 61 seats, Reform UK 13, the SNP 10, Plaid Cymru is on four and the Green Party two. Other parties, including those in Northern Ireland, are forecast to get 19 seats. Enter your postcode or a constituency name to find what the exit poll forecast is currently suggesting may happen in your area. Bear in mind that this is only an indication of what may happen. Sir John Curtice, who leads the exit poll team, says the number of seats Reform will win is particularly uncertain. He explains: “Our model suggests there are many places where they have some, but a relatively low, chance of winning.” This look-up will be updated as results come in and the forecasts are modified. The exit poll is a way of forecasting what may happen in the general election, after voting ends but before the results are known. The poll focuses on revealing national trends and is mainly used to forecast which party may form the government at Westminster. Forecasting results at a constituency level is harder, especially if there are local factors that make the election distinct in any particular seat. Researchers at 133 polling stations across England, Scotland and Wales ask around 20,000 people to indicate which way they voted. A team of academics led by Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, uses this and other data to estimate the vote share per party in each constituency and then to forecast each party's likelihood of winning in any given seat. All the individual probabilities are added together to arrive at the forecast seat totals for each party. The exit poll is not held in Northern Ireland so the 18 seats there are labelled “Other”. The model is updated throughout the night as results come in, so seat totals and individual constituencies are likely to change. These maps show the exit poll forecast across England, Wales and Scotland. In the locations coloured grey, the contest is very close. Everywhere else is coloured by the party currently considered most likely to win. When an actual result is declared it will overwrite the exit poll data in this map, and in the postcode lookup above.  Again, the forecasts may change over the night. You will need to refresh this page to see those updates. Rural constituencies are larger than those in cities because the population is more spread out. So here is the same data in a cartogram, where each constituency is shown as equal in size. The cartogram is a way of viewing each seat as the same size, while attempting to show roughly where in the UK they are. All the seats are correctly within the right nation and English region, but they may not follow typical geography beyond that. There are some, mostly around London - whose high population density distorts the map most significantly - that are in different places to where you'd expect, no longer neighbouring the seats they lie next to geographically. All declaration times estimated by the BBC are approximate and the actual results may happen earlier or later than stated. As with the main results, all 2019 figures are notional, because of boundary changes. You can read more about that here.  Full details of how the exit poll methodology was developed can be found at Warwick University Department of Statistics website.

67,US man jailed in Russia for 12 years on drug charges,"A US citizen has been sentenced to 12.5 years at a maximum security penal colony by a Russian court after being convicted on drugs charges.  Robert Woodland, 32, was detained in Moscow in January and accused by prosecutors of seeking to sell a large quantity of methadone. His lawyer told the Reuters news agency that he had partially confessed to the charges. Mr Woodland, who was born in Russia and adopted when he was two, had travelled to the country in 2020 to find his birth mother. His journey was documented by a Russian reality TV programme. He is the latest US citizen to be imprisoned in the country, with some Western officials suggesting the Kremlin is ""hoarding"" Americans to trade for allies and operatives imprisoned abroad.  In a statement released after Mr Woodland's conviction on Thursday, Russian prosecutors said he had been caught while packaging a large quantity of narcotics at an apartment in the Russian capital.  They claimed he had been working with a large-scale criminal group and had transported 50-grams of the drug from a pick-up point outside the city.  His lawyer, Stanislav Kshevitsky, had initially denied the charges, saying officials had presented ""no evidence"" of drug sales before the court.  But he told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Mr Woodland had confessed to some of the allegations against him. It remains unclear which charges he has accepted.  Footage carried by state media in Russia showed Mr Woodland sitting inside a glass cage in court, staring impassively ahead as the verdict against him was read out.  Russian media reported that Mr Woodland decided to remain in the country after meeting his mother in 2020 and worked as an English teacher near Moscow. His tearful reunion with his mother was broadcast on state television at the time.  The Interfax news agency said he holds US and Russian citizenship.  At least a dozen US nationals, including journalists and active duty soldiers, are currently being held in Russian prisons and penal colonies.  Among those is Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained over a year ago on espionage charges which he denies. The US considers him to be ""wrongfully detained"". Western officials have long suspected that Moscow is seeking to detain Western citizens to use as bargaining chips in prisoner swaps. US law prohibits the payment of ransoms to terror groups, but successive administrations have been willing to offer concessions to other states to secure the release of Americans.  This is what happened to Brittney Griner, who was released at the end of 2022 in a prisoner swap with the US in return for the controversial Russian arms dealer Victor Bout. While the US state department said earlier this year that it was aware of Mr Woodland's case, it avoided commenting directly on the allegations.  Instead, it issued a statement saying it “has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas"". US officials have repeatedly warned US citizens in Russia to leave the country, citing the risk of wrongful arrest and harassment by authorities.

65,Hezbollah fires 200 rockets and drones into Israel,"The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has launched more than 200 rockets and attack drones into northern Israel, in response to the killing of one of its senior commanders. Israel's military said one of its officers was killed in the barrage, which started a number of fires.  The military also said it had targeted Hezbollah “military structures” and other targets in southern Lebanon in response.  Lebanese media reported that one person was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the town of Houla. The latest barrage, which followed one comprising 100 rockets on Wednesday afternoon, was one of the biggest so far in the nine months of cross-border violence which have raised fears of an all-out war. The Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was one of the most senior figures in the group to have been killed in the conflict. The Israeli military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah’s Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a “large number of terror attacks”. It also described him as “the counterpart” of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of another unit whose killing last month prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 200 rockets and missiles into northern Israel in a single day. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. So far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, and 25 people in Israel, mostly soldiers. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to restore security in northern Israel. ""In the tough campaign against Lebanon we have set a principle - whoever harms us is a dead man. We are making that a reality in practice,"" he said on Thursday. The hostilities have also displaced tens of thousands of people from border communities in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. “The response to the assassination of the dear leader Hajj Abu Nimah [Nasser]... started last night and quickly,"" senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned at Nasser’s funeral in Beirut on Thursday. “This series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit.” A spokeswoman for the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said the exchanges were now extending deeper into both sides of the border, and called on both Israel and Hezbollah to show restraint. “We're very concerned... because any exchange, any incident, can escalate into something greater if there is a misunderstanding,” Kandice Ardiel told the BBC. There has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions in recent weeks, with the UN and US warning of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a war that could also draw in Iran and other allied groups. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are ready for a war if diplomacy fails. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that the military would soon be ready to “take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength”. Hezbollah, which is seen as a significantly superior foe to Hamas, has said it does not want a full-out war with Israel and that it will observe in Lebanon any ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But it has also warned Israel that it would fight “without rules” if there was a war.",2024-07-04 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw9y7wqn8j5o,"David Gritten,",2024-07-04 19:10:07,
66,Jill Biden: The quiet influence of Biden's closest adviser,"A day after US President Joe Biden struggled through a 90-minute debate that only served to fuel voter concerns about his age and fitness, Jill Biden stood before well-heeled donors at a New York fundraiser and tried to explain what they had all witnessed.  ""'You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened. I didn’t feel that great,'"" the president had confessed, she told them. ""I said, ‘Look, Joe, we are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you’ve been president.’” It offered an early glimpse into the president's mindset and how he rated his debate performance, which was widely panned as a major blow to his campaign. As doubts about Mr Biden's candidacy began to circulate, his closest adviser was unequivocal about whether he would step out of the race. ""When he gets knocked down, Joe gets back up, and that’s what we’re doing today,"" Mrs Biden said. The first lady has stood beside her husband throughout his decades-long career, from his time as a Delaware senator to becoming commander-in-chief, often serving as the decisive voice behind many of Mr Biden's political choices.  While the president often turns to his tight-knit family on big decisions, Mrs Biden is among a handful of top advisers who wield the most influence over the president and could ultimately help him determine whether it is time to step out of the race.  “It’s fair to call her Biden’s closest adviser,” veteran Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkop told the BBC. “Family matters to him significantly and that makes Jill Biden’s role even more important.” The president’s younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who served as his campaign manager during his years in the Senate, as well as his son, Hunter Biden, are also among his most trusted confidantes.  After the fallout from the debate, Mr Biden huddled with his family for a long-planned trip to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, where they discussed the fate of his campaign and urged him to keep fighting, according to the BBC's US partner CBS. Hunter Biden was among the most vocal family members urging his father to remain in the race, CBS reported.  But as Democratic anxiety over the  81-year-old president's physical and mental stamina has spilled into public view in recent days, many inside the party have looked to the first lady for any hint of wavering over his candidacy.  Instead, she has continued to hit the campaign trail, travelling to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan this week for a string of political and official events. ""Because there's a lot of talk out there, let me repeat what my husband has said plainly and clearly: Joe is the Democratic nominee and he is going to beat Donald Trump, just like he did in 2020,"" Mrs Biden told supporters at a campaign event in Traverse City, Michigan, on Wednesday.  Mrs Biden's influence in the West Wing, however, is not unusual.  Nancy Kegan Smith, president of the First Ladies Association for Research and Education, said there are historic parallels between Mrs Biden and former first ladies. ""Most presidents depend on the uncoloured advice of their wives because that’s the person who is normally closest to them,” she said. She pointed to Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of former President Lyndon B Johnson, who advised her husband - ultimately convincing him with a moving letter - to run for the White House in August 1964 after he became president following the assassination of John F Kennedy. Four years later in 1968, she changed her opinion, telling him to not run for re-election. He listened, Ms Kegan Smith said. Many in the Democratic Party are waiting to see if a similar scenario may unfold in the next month, placing a greater spotlight on Mrs Biden. The first lady keeps a busy schedule. She is the first in the East Wing to keep a day job teaching English at a northern Virginia community college. When she is not teaching, she is often on the road campaigning for her husband. “Most modern first ladies have been in the political game for quite a while and have been political sounding boards to their husbands,” Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University professor who studies first ladies, told BBC News. The president proposed five times before Mrs Biden said yes, and the couple married in 1977, five years after Mr Biden lost his first wife and daughter in a car crash that also injured his two sons. When he decided not to run for president in 2016, he told 60 Minutes ""it was the right decision for the family"". He cited his reasoning was in part because of the loss of his son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.  Mrs Biden specifically played a role in her husband's decision not to run for president in 2003, Ms Kegan Smith said, pointing to a scene described in the first lady's 2019 memoir, Where the Light Enters. In the book, she recalled lounging by the pool as Democratic advisers inside encouraged her husband to launch a campaign. Wearing a bikini, she wrote ""no"" on her stomach in magic marker and walked through the meeting. Biden did not enter the race that year.  But the first lady has also come under pressure in recent days, facing criticism after the presidential debate for praising her husband after his poor showing on the debate stage.  “Joe, you did such a great job. You answered every question. You knew all the facts,” she told him on stage at a post-debate rally in Atlanta. A clip of the exchange was widely mocked on social media. Some Republicans have also seized on Democratic worry, laying blame on the first lady for Mr Biden's debate performance. Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican from Wyoming, even accused Mrs Biden of “elder abuse” in a post on X, for “rolling him out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed”. The Drudge Report, a conservative website, ran a headline on its front page immediately after the debate that read: “Cruel Jill clings to power.” “It’s really unfair to put the burden on her. She’s his spouse. She’s not a politician,"" Michael LaRosa, her former press secretary, told The Hill. “It’s not up to her to save the Democratic Party."" Mrs Biden, meanwhile, has stressed that the president's bid for re-election will continue as the stakes in November are high. “Every campaign is important, and every campaign is hard,” the first lady told Vogue for their August cover story. “Each campaign is unique. But this one, the urgency is different. We know what’s at stake. Joe is asking the American people to come together to draw a line in the sand against all this vitriol.” That urgency is something the campaign is hoping she'll be able to convey to voters. In a statement to the BBC, the Biden campaign called Mrs Biden an ""effective messenger"" on the campaign trail.  “As a teacher, mom, and grandmother, she’s uniquely positioned to connect with key constituencies across the country and speak to the president’s vision for America,” the statement said.  Still, her steadfast support combined with White House dismissals of media reports that the president is weighing his exit have yet to tamp down growing uncertainty about the Democratic ticket. The fallout has triggered a backlash of Democrats, donors and some lawmakers publicly calling for the president's withdrawal from the race.  ""Joe has been knocked down and counted out his whole life... When he gets counted out, he works harder. And that's what he's doing, but he needs your help,"" she told Michigan supporters on Wednesday.  ""We don't choose our chapter of history, but we can choose who leads us through it,"" she added.  For Mrs Biden, that choice remains her husband. ",2024-07-04 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4w21kznw1o,"Rachel Looker,",2024-07-04 17:10:07,

69,President’s daughter posts kiss with woman in country where gay sex is banned,"The daughter of Cameroon's president has shared an image in which she is kissing another woman, sparking mixed reactions in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal. The Instagram post shows 26-year-old Brenda Biya embracing Brazillian model Layyons Valença. ""I’m crazy about you & I want the world to know,” Ms Biya wrote, adding a love heart emoji. Her 91-year-old father, Paul Biya, became Cameroon's president in 1982 and is one of Africa's longest-ruling leaders. Those engaging in same-sex acts or relationships in the Central African nation face up to five years in jail.  Ms Biya - a musician based abroad who goes by the name King Nasty - did not explicitly state her sexuality when posting the picture of the kiss. However, some time after the image was published, Ms Biya shared an article from Le Monde, in which the French newspaper reported that she had ""come out"". She also shared other messages from people expressing their support for her. Transgender Cameroonian activist Shakiro was among those who praised Ms Biya, saying her Instagram post could be a ""turning point for the LGBTQ+ community in Cameroon"". Shakiro said Ms Biya “is now positioning herself as a voice for social change in a country where taboos are deeply rooted"".  Shakiro currently resides in Belgium. She sought asylum there after being convicted of “attempted homosexuality” in Cameroon. Although Ms Biya has been praised by some, several social media users in Cameroon responded to her post with homophobic comments.  Some have speculated whether Ms Biya shared the picture in order to generate a buzz, given her reputation for publishing social media posts that spark controversy among Cameroonians. There have also been questions about whether coming out is a privilege that can only be enjoyed by a select few in the country. “I love this for Cameroon’s First Daughter,” LGBT activist Bandy Kiki said in a Facebook post. “However, it highlights a harsh reality: Anti-LGBT laws in Cameroon disproportionately target the poor. Wealth and connections create a shield for some, while others face severe consequences.” Human rights groups have previously criticised Cameroon’s strict laws against members of the LGBT community. In 2022, Human Rights Watch urged Cameroon to “take urgent action to revoke this discriminatory law and to ensure that the human rights of all Cameroonians, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics, are upheld”. Barrister Alice Nkom, a renowned human rights lawyer who defends LGBT people in Cameroon, said Ms Biya was a ""model of courage"" who is “sending an important universal message of love"". Most media outlets in Cameroon have not reported on Ms Biya's recent picture. The media regulatory body has been known to sanction publications and broadcasters for depictions of homosexuality. The government - and President Biya himself - have not officially commented on the story either. The BBC has contacted Ms Biya and is yet to receive a response.

70,Verstappen & Norris 'both happy to race' after clash,"Max Verstappen took victory at last year's British Grand Prix with Lando Norris finishing second and Lewis Hamilton in third place Max Verstappen says he and Lando Norris ""agreed with 99% of everything"" when they discussed their Austrian Grand Prix clash this week. The pair, who collided while fighting for the lead at the Red Bull Ring on Sunday, resume battle at the British Grand Prix this weekend. Verstappen revealed he ""cared about maintaining his relationship"" with Norris because ""we are great friends"". During their talk this week, the world champion said he told the McLaren driver they could trust each other when racing closely. Verstappen added: ""We go at it flat out - that's what we agreed. That's what we like to do and that's what's good for F1 as well."" Briton Norris said: ""It's clear how he races. It's tough, it's on the limit, it's what I love. I thoroughly enjoyed the fight I had with him. ""The more I've thought about it, the more I think it's just racing. It was good racing, very close to the edge at times. We've spoken about it and we are both happy to go racing again."" Their battle ended when they touched while Norris was trying to overtake Verstappen around the outside and both suffered punctures, a collision for which the Dutchman was given a 10-second penalty. Verstappen recovered to finish fifth while the damage caused to Norris' McLaren forced the 24-year-old's retirement. Norris on 'nerve-wracking' battle with Verstappen and confidence in McLaren British teenager Bearman joins Haas for 2025 How to follow British Grand Prix on the BBC Verstappen said: ""The only thing I cared about was maintaining my relationship with Lando because we are great friends and thats' why I said after the race we had to let things cool down because emotions run high. ""We spoke on Monday and we came to the conclusion that we actually really enjoyed our battle. ""We like to race hard. We have done this for many years not only in F1, like online racing where we had a lot of fun together, and these things have to carry on because that's what we like to do and it's great for F1."" Verstappen added he had reassured Norris about his intentions when they are racing. ""I always said to Lando, 'When you go for moves up the inside or outside, you can trust me that I am not there to try and crash you out of the way'. Same the other way around because we spoke about that as well."" Verstappen leads Norris in the drivers' championship by 81 points  Norris had accused Verstappen of changing his line in the braking zone, which is forbidden in F1, and the Dutchman acknowledged indirectly that had been the case. ""Naturally, there is always a human reaction when someone dives down the inside or outside that you have a bit of a reaction to it,"" said Verstappen. ""But I felt everything I did was nothing massively over the top. ""Of course, like how you design a car, you try to go to the edge of the rules, maybe you find some grey areas here and there, and that's the same how you race because otherwise you will never be a top driver or succeed in life anyway."" Norris, who trails Verstappen in the drivers' championship by 81 points, added: ""Max isn't going to want to crash and ruin his own chances. I don't think he's going to change too much, and I don't think I need to change much. ""There are things from both sides we probably wanted to do better. But avoiding an incident from moving under braking is probably the biggest thing. ""The stewards need to be aware that something can easily go wrong. You're defending and that's fine, but at some point that has a limit and it needs to be imposed."" Asked if they could remain friends if their battles continued for a long time, Verstappen said: ""I think so. It also depends on your personalities. Lando is a great guy, a really nice person, who loves F1 and racing and is very passionate about it. ""You also have to realise that he is fighting for his second win, I am fighting for my 62nd, so your emotions are a little bit different. I know that from myself, when I was fighting for my first wins, that’s what I also said, 'Let's let it cool off'."" Another issue to arise from Austria was that Norris earned a five-second penalty for going off track while trying to pass Verstappen, despite immediately giving the place back, because it was conflated with a warning he had previously been given for exceeding track limits. Norris himself and Williams driver Alex Albon both said that decision was ""silly"". Verstappen admitted it was ""a bit of an odd one"". He said Red Bull have an upgrade on their car this weekend, but that he expected the battle to be close on track with McLaren. Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri said he expected Verstappen to be ""really tough to beat"" because of his car's strengths in the sort of high-speed corners that abound at Silverstone.

71,How record-breaking Hurricane Beryl is a sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 11:10:10,
72,Murray thanks Wimbledon for 'emotional' farewell celebration,"This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Andy Murray thanked Wimbledon organisers for an ""emotional"" farewell ceremony after his final appearance began with a defeat alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. The two-time singles champion is playing at the All England Club for the last time before retiring later this year. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation with elongated applause. ""It feels like a good ending to me. Whether I deserve it or not, I don't know. But they did a really, really good job,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016. The Murray brothers arrived on a packed Centre Court to a standing ovation. Another followed moments after they lost 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 to Australian pair John Peers and Rinky Hijikata. Murray's parents Judy and Will, his wife Kim and two of their daughters watched on as former BBC presenter Sue Barker conducted a poignant ceremony shortly after. Murray thanked his family, his team members over the years and the fans for their continued support. ""It is hard because I want to keep playing, but I can't,"" Murray said on court. ""Physically it's too tough now. I want to play forever. I love the sport."" This video can not be played Andy Murray looks back on his career with Sue Barker Fellow Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic, Martina Navratilova, John McEnroe and Iga Swiatek applauded from the side of the court, alongside British players Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie. Murray is set to appear again later this week, having signed up to the mixed doubles with fellow British Grand Slam champion Emma Raducanu. ""It was obviously very special to play with Jamie, we've not the chance to do it before,"" Murray, who won the first of his three major titles at the 2012 US Open, said. ""It was a race against time to get out here and physically it wasn't easy but I'm glad we were able to do it one time together."" Wimbledon has been the scene of many of the defining moments of Murray's career and the emotional ties are why he fought so hard to play one final time. Murray's chances of a last hurrah had been thrown into serious doubt. A back issue caused a loss of power and feeling in his right leg during a match at Queen's three weeks ago. The only option was an operation on 22 June to remove a cyst close to his spine, but it left Murray in a race against time to be fit. Ultimately, having left making a decision until the night before his scheduled singles match on Tuesday, he realised with a heavy heart it was not possible to play a five-set match. Going out alongside 38-year-old Jamie in the shorter doubles format was the next best thing. The plan, which was initially put in place around the French Open in late May, did come to fruition. Not since 1995 had a men's doubles first-round match been put on Centre Court. This occasion could not have been scheduled anywhere else. Murray reached his first Wimbledon final in 2012, losing to Roger Federer in an four-set match which left him in tears and changed public perception about him. Redemption came when he won Olympic singles gold on the same court against the same opponent four weeks later. A year on, Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's singles champion by beating world number one Djokovic in a moment of national celebration. Another triumph at the All England Club came in 2016, which he says he enjoyed more. After both victories, Murray walked back through the marbled corridors of Centre Court - like tradition dictates - and was given a guard of honour before stepping on to the balcony to greet the adoring fans below. The same ceremonial walk was made by Murray again on Thursday night. While Murray had not won the trophy again, it was the only farewell - of sorts - fit for a player who has led British tennis with distinction. This video can not be played Murrays walk out on Centre Court to standing ovation Talk of the Super Murray Bros dominated day four of this year's Championships. The famous Wimbledon queue, where fans camp overnight to grab one of the limited first-come first-served tickets for the following day, grew to a line of 11,000 hopefuls by mid-morning. The Murraynators were there, of course. A group of super-fans, who have travelled the world to watch their hero, slept outside in Wimbledon Park and were rewarded with Centre Court tickets. If you weren't there with a tent and sleeping bag, your alarm had to be set for a time when nightclubs usually kick out. Inside the All England Club, fans not fortunate enough to have a court ticket gathered on Henman Hill - sorry, Murray Mound. Hundreds had been in position all day with picnics and blankets. Back on Centre, supporters took a breather after women's top seed Swiatek wrapped up a straight-set win at about 18:30 BST. Then, the change of stage began. Down came the net and singles posts, replaced by the longer doubles version. A half-hour turnaround allowed the atmosphere to bubble with the Murrays' nearest and dearest taking their seats. Andy's wife Kim was flanked by their daughters, with mum Judy alongside them. Dad Will had travelled down from Scotland to watch. This video can not be played Murray gets Centre Court ovation from Wimbledon greats Andy Murray insisted the brothers were not just playing for show, claiming they had a good chance of winning the match and going far in the tournament. The match did not pan out as they hoped.  It was clear from the third game that the younger Murray sibling was struggling with his movement. His 'will to win' - which has become the epitaph of his tennis career - had not diminished, however. The usual teeth-bearing and fist-pumping was on show. As was the chuntering at his team. Unfortunately, his body was not operating how his mind wanted it to. That's been a recurring theme for the past five and a half years. At the 2019 Australian Open, Murray broke down in a news conference as he said he thought he would have to retire later that year because of a hip injury. No singles player had come back to professional tennis after a resurfacing surgery. Metal-hip Murray not only returned. He returned and won an ATP Tour title later that year. More memorable moments at Grand Slams followed. But he could not regain the level which made him one of the best players of his generation. ""The injuries have been tough, quite significant injuries,"" he said.  ""We've worked extremely hard just to be on the court competing, probably not on the level that any of us wanted but we tried."" This video can not be played Sue-prise!

74,Groenewegen wins Tour stage six in photo finish,"Dylan Groenewegen claimed his sixth stage win on the Tour de France Dutch rider Dylan Groenewegen clinched victory in a thrilling photo finish to win stage six of the Tour de France. The flat 163.5km route from Macon to Dijon was always likely to end in a bunch sprint, following Mark Cavendish's record-breaking victory a day earlier. But the British rider, 39, finished out of contention in Thursday's sprint and was unable to add to Wednesday's 35th stage win on the Tour, which took him clear of Eddy Merckx for the outright record. Team Jayco–AlUla's Groenewegen, 31, made a late surge for the line to beat Jasper Philipsen by little more than a wheel trim. That gave Groenewegen the sixth stage win of his career and his first since 2022, his first year with his Australian team. Alpecin-Deceuninck's Philipsen was later relegated to 107th place for shifting his line and blocking Wout van Aert during the the final 150m. There was no change at the top of the general classification standings so Tadej Pogacar remains the leader, 45 seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard five seconds further adrift in third. Dylan Groenewegen (furthest right) lunged for the line to beat Jasper Philipsen (furthest left) Astana Qazaqstan's sporting director Mark Renshaw said after Cavendish's win on Wednesday that coming into this year's Tour, which is expected to be the Manx Missile's last, the team felt that Thursday's stage would be his best opportunity to clinch the record. Having sealed the deal on stage five, it means Cavendish now has the chance to increase his record before finally calling it quits. With just one climb on the stage, it promised to be a relatively straightforward ride through the vineyards of Burgundy, and so it proved for the most part. Cavendish did show some frustration after the first of two stoppages because of mechanical issues, but he managed to safely rejoin the peloton long before it picked up the pace rolling into Dijon. He was well placed before the Uno-X Mobility team hit the front but Astana started to fall back with less than 2km remaining and, as the race entered the 800m dash to the line, Cavendish had drifted out of contention. Mathieu van der Poel led out team-mate Philipsen, who then hit the front before Groenewegen - sporting sunglasses that feature an aerodynamic beak - and stage three winner Biniam Girmay came back at the Belgian. Philipsen looked to have held them off but it needed a photo to split them, which showed that Groenewegen had timed his lunge for the line to perfection to win it by little more than the width of his wheel trim. Philipsen was later penalised for forcing Van Aert to slow down as they raced along the barriers. The race continues on Friday with an individual time trial over 25.3km from Nuits-Saint-Georges to Gevrey-Chambertin. 1. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/Team Jayco-AlUla) 3hrs 31mins 55secs 2.

75,Raducanu and Kartal aim for Wimbledon last 16,"Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal played each other frequently as juniors Former junior rivals Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal will aim to reach the Wimbledon last 16 on Friday when they play their third-round matches. Raducanu is second on Centre Court against Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari. Fellow Briton Kartal, the world number 298, faces second seed Coco Gauff in the final match on Court One. Before Raducanu's tie, there is an attractive match-up between defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz and 29th seed Frances Tiafoe from 13:30 BST. World number one Jannik Sinner closes the programme on Centre against Miomir Kecmanovic.  Wildcard Raducanu, 21, comes into the third round full of confidence after she thoroughly outplayed Elise Mertens on Wednesday, losing just three games in her success. The test against Sakkari is a rematch of their 2021 US Open semi-final which the Briton won 6-1 6-4 on her way to the title. Now ranked 135th as she continues her comeback from multiple surgeries last year, Raducanu reached the Nottingham semi-finals and Eastbourne quarter-finals in the build-up to Wimbledon. ""I have had quite a few matches on grass so I am feeling really good,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It's a match where I can go out and have a swing. ""I have no pressure or expectation to beat someone in the top 10 right now, but of course I believe in myself and I'm confident with the way I am playing."" This video can not be played Best Shots: Kartal's 'dream run' at Wimbledon goes on While Raducanu rocketed to stardom with her stunning win in New York as an 18-year-old qualifier, Kartalc, 22, has taken longer to make a name for herself. The pair regularly played each other at junior level and a clip of a lengthy rally, external from that period has previously gone viral. Kartal's development was checked by injuries before ""a scary few months at the start of the year"" with health issues. She did not expect to be well enough to play at Wimbledon this year and says coming through qualifying was ""the best thing for me"". Kartal told BBC Sport she had ""spent my whole life kind of under the radar a little bit"". On Friday, she steps into the Court One spotlight to play American Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion. ""I think it's what dreams are made of,"" said Kartal. ""I came here as a little kid, when I was six or seven, watching matches. I've got pictures in my house of me and my family on Centre Court, watching Roger Federer and things like that.

81,Gaza hostage posters outside US lawmaker's office vandalised,"Vandals tore down posters of Israeli hostages hung on the wall outside the Capitol Hill office of a Democratic lawmaker on 4 July, his office said on Friday. Congressman Brad Schneider called the vandalism ""a vile act of hate"".  The posters included photos of more than 100 people, eight of them Americans, taken as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.  Capitol police say they are aware of the vandalism incident outside the congressional office and are investigating. Mr Schneider, a pro-Israel Democrat from Illinois, posted a photo on X, formerly Twitter, showing the posters shredded and tossed across the hallway.  ""This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day,"" he wrote.   ""Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.""  The incident comes less than a week after pro-Palestinian protesters held an overnight rally outside Mr  Schneider's Highland Park home in Illinois. The lawmaker said masked demonstrators banged drums, blew horns and screamed antisemitic chants outside his home. Police dispersed the crowd of around 40 protesters after several complaints from neighbours.  ""These actions don't advance peace,"" Mr Schneider said.  ""Instead, they play directly into the hands of Hamas terrorists enabling them to continue to hold hostage not only those they kidnapped from Israel, but all civilians in Gaza as well.""   The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Over 100 were released during a November cease-fire.  At least 38,010 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

80,'Breakthrough' heightens hopes of Gaza ceasefire deal,"The head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, David Barnea, is reported to have travelled alone to Doha to meet Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani as momentum is again building over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. This appears to be very much a preliminary move in what could once again be a complicated series of discussions aimed at finally bridging the gap between the Israeli government and Hamas over what each defines as its bottom line in what any potential deal would comprise. After Mr Barnea left Doha, the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said gaps still remained between the two sides. Israeli officials had already said that expectations need to be lowered. The latest rekindling of hope for a deal came after Hamas delivered its response to the three-phase proposal that President Biden set out several weeks ago.   The key to that formulation was to put off what has long appeared to be the main obstacle in either side accepting a deal - the demand by Hamas that there must be a permanent ceasefire and the counter-demand by Israel that it must have the freedom to resume fighting in Gaza if necessary. Exactly what Hamas has presented has not yet been made public.  But the Israeli response appears far more positive than in other instances in the past seven months when the process has regained momentum.  A source in Israel's negotiating team said that the proposal put forward by Hamas included a ""very significant breakthrough"". There are indications that this could be that Hamas has accepted the key point of the proposal announced by President Biden - that it would allow negotiations to achieve its goal of a permanent end to the war through the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, rather than demanding it as the starting point. Hamas has throughout bridled at its portrayal by the US in particular as the main stumbling block in agreeing a deal.  Should it become clear that it has indeed made this concession, then the ball would be firmly back in the court of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At no time has he personally yielded an inch in his public commitment to the complete eradication of Hamas - and Israel's right to continue fighting in Gaza after any ceasefire.  He has resisted all pressure from inside and outside Israel to modify that stance.  But the pressure has been building on him from all sides, inexorably. The latest push seems to have come from within his own military.  A recent article in the New York Times, citing unnamed current and former security officials, said that Israel's top generals ""want to begin a ceasefire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being"". Mr Netanyahu dismissed this as defeatist.  But he may not be able to resist such pressure forever - nor the ever growing anger on the streets of Israel from those who want the remaining hostages in Gaza to be brought home now. For Hamas, there are also some signs of growing despair over the continuing war by those who suffer from it every day, the civilian population of Gaza.  And internationally, the patience of mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, may be running out.   Regional countries that wholeheartedly support the Palestinian cause have also been reported to be putting increasing pressure on Hamas to accept a deal.  Its leadership may feel that the group's apparent survival, even if severely degraded both politically and militarily, may be victory enough. And for the international community, the need to find some end to the war has grown even more urgent with the spectre of the confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah potentially erupting into all-out war.  A ceasefire in Gaza could potentially ease those tensions. And for the Biden administration - still reeling in the aftermath of last week's debate between the president and Donald Trump - a diplomatic success here would be a much-needed boost. All these elements suggest that the hopes that have once again been raised may this time finally prove more resilient to the negative factors that have seen them dashed before.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyz4y6979o,"Sebastian Usher,",2024-07-05 20:10:27,
79,Biden vows to stay in race and beat Trump in defiant speech,"US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course in his re-election bid and defeat Donald Trump in a defiant speech on Friday, as questions continue to swirl over whether he will drop out of the race. At a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the 81-year-old acknowledged his disastrous performance in last week's CNN debate. ""Ever since then, there’s been a lot of speculation. What’s Joe going to do?” he told the crowd. “Here’s my answer. I am running and going to win again,” Mr Biden said, as supporters in the crucial battleground state cheered his name. It marked his latest commitment to staying in the race as he seeks to defuse a political crisis that has snowballed in recent days. The 17-minute speech, which was more energetic than his widely-panned performance on the debate stage, comes at a critical moment for his campaign, with donors and Democratic allies considering whether to stick with him. The campaign recognises that the next few days could make or break his re-election bid, according to various reports in US media, as Mr Biden seeks to regain ground that he lost to his Republican rival Donald Trump following the debate. After his speech in Madison, a rare sit-down interview will air on ABC News at 20:00 EDT which will also be closely watched by those questioning his commitment and fitness. As he took the stage at the rally, Mr Biden passed one voter who was holding a sign reading ""Pass the torch, Joe"". Another voter who stood outside the venue held a sign that read ""Save your legacy, drop out!"". ""I see all these stories that say I'm too old,"" Mr Biden said at the rally, before triumphing his record in the White House. ""Was I too old to create 15 million jobs?"" he said. ""Was I too old to erase student debt for five million Americans?"" “Do you think I’m too old to beat Donald Trump?"" he asked, as the crowd responded ""no"". Referencing Trump's criminal conviction in New York, and the other charges he is facing in separate cases, he called his rival a ""one-man crime wave"". Pressure on Mr Biden to step aside has only grown following the debate which was marked by several instances where he lost his train of thought, raising concerns about his age and mental fitness. His campaign is planning an aggressive come-back. His wife, Jill Biden, as well as Vice-President Kamala Harris, are planning a campaign blitz to travel to every battleground swing state this month.  Mr Biden, who is due to speak at another rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked the vice-president for her support. She has emerged as the most likely candidate to replace him on the Democratic ticket if he were to step down. On Thursday, Mr Biden acknowledged that he ""screwed up"" in the debate. He has blamed jet lag for his poor performance, saying that his busy travel schedule prevented him from getting sufficient rest before the debate. ""I didn’t listen to my staff... and then I nearly fell asleep on stage,” he said. The Washington Post has reported that Mr Biden's senior team are aware of the pressure coming from within the Democratic Party to make a decision on the future of his candidacy within the next week.  Three Democrats in the House of Representatives in Congress have now called for him to withdraw from the race - Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Raúl Grijalva of Arizona and Seth Boulton of Massachusetts.  “President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington’s footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,” Mr Moulton told radio station WBUR on Thursday. However, no senior Democrats have called on him to quit, as his campaign has pointed out to reporters. On Friday, reports emerged that Senator Mark Warner was attempting to form a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Mr Biden to drop out of the race. The reports, including one in the Washington Post, suggested Mr Warner had deep concerns following the CNN debate. At the rally in Madison, multiple Biden supporters told BBC News that they supported his bid for re-election and were not concerned about the debate debacle. ""I’m not worried about his health. I think he can go all the way to the election and beyond,"" said primary school teacher Susan Shotliff, 56. Some said that while Mr Biden struggled for words, more focus should be on his Republican rival. ""During the debate, [Trump] told a bunch of lies. How is that any worse than what Biden did?"" said Greg Hovel, 67. Others expressed more concern. ""I wanted to have a first hand look at how he’s like, his mannerisms, his energy,"" said Thomas Leffler, a health researcher from Madison. ""I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump."" ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl5y8n5d09qo,"Mike Wendling in Madison, Wisconsin & Max Matza,",2024-07-05 21:10:27,
77,Hungary's Russia-friendly PM meets Putin in Moscow,"Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, in a visit that has been heavily criticised by EU leaders and Ukraine's government.  Friday's meeting was part of what Mr Orban called a ""peace mission"", coming three days  after a visit to Kyiv where he met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hungary has just taken over the presidency of the Council of the European Union, but EU leaders have stressed that Mr Orban is not acting on behalf of the bloc.  Mr Orban is the EU's only head of government to have kept close ties to the Kremlin following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After the meeting, which lasted several hours, Hungary's PM said Russia and Ukraine were still ""far apart"" in their views on achieving peace.  ""Many steps are needed to end the war, but we took the first step to restore dialogue,"" he said.  The Russian leader called it a ""frank and useful"" conversation. He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy. Volodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Earlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting ""not just as a long-time partner"" but as a European Union representative.  However, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU.  ""The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU,"" Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X.  ""The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine."" ""Appeasement will not stop Putin,"" European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. Ukraine also condemned the visit: ""For our country, the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all states to strictly adhere to it,"" the foreign ministry said a statement.  Earlier this week, Mr Orban visited Kyiv, saying ""a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations"". President Zelensky - who has had frosty relations with Mr Orban - did not publicly respond to the proposal.  Ahead of Ukraine’s offensive last summer, Mr Orban warned that Ukraine cannot win on the battlefield.  Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Hungarian prime minister has underlined that Russia’s advantage in resources and men makes Putin’s country unbeatable.  However, many Ukrainians believe any ceasefire would simply cement Russia’s hold over territory it has seized from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot. Mr Orban has been a vocal critic of Western support for Ukraine. He previously slowed agreement on a €50bn ($54bn; £42bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia. Tuesday's visit to Kyiv was his first in 12 years, while he met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time. During Mr Orban's joint appearance with Mr Zelensky, the body language between them was not warm, and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements. But for the next six months Mr Orban's position as head of the Council of the European Union means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe.  His visit to Kyiv came on his second day in that role, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml29r8d2zxo,"Jaroslav Lukiv and Nick Thorpe,",2024-07-05 16:10:27,

82,Pope Francis critic excommunicated by the Vatican,"An Italian archbishop and staunch critic of Pope Francis has been excommunicated by the Vatican, its doctrinal office has said.  Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of schism - meaning he has split from the Catholic Church - after years of fierce disagreement with the pontiff.  The 83-year-old ultra-conservative has previously called on the Pope to resign, accusing him of heresy and criticising his stances on immigration, climate change and same-sex couples. Archbishop Vigano was a senior figure in the Church, serving as papal envoy to Washington from 2011 to 2016.  In 2018 he went into hiding after alleging that the Pope had known about sexual abuse by an American cardinal and failed to act. The Vatican rejected the accusation. Over time, the archbishop became associated with US conspiracy theorists, criticising Covid vaccines and alleging a ""globalist"" and ""anti-Christian"" project by the UN and other groups - both familiar conspiratorial themes. On Friday the Vatican's doctrinal office said his refusal to submit to Pope Francis was clear from his public statements. ""The Most Reverend Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of the reserved delict [violation of the law] of schism,"" the statement said, adding that he had been excommunicated - or banished  from the church. Responding by a post on X, the archbishop linked to the decree that was emailed to him and said: ""What was attributed to me as guilt for my conviction is now put on record, confirming the Catholic Faith that I fully profess."" Archbishop Vigano was charged with schism and denying the pope's legitimacy last month.  At the time, he write on X that he regarded the accusations against him as ""an honour"".  ""I repudiate, reject, and condemn the scandals, errors, and heresies of Jorge Mario Bergoglio,"" he said, using Argentine Pope's given name. Pope Francis has put himself at odds with traditionalist Catholics by making overtures towards the LGBTQ+ community, championing migrant rights and condemning the excesses of capitalism.  Last year, he took action against another ultra-conservative critic, dismissing Bishop Joseph E Strickland of Texas when he refused to resign after an investigation.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84j07d0j92o,"Ian Aikman,",2024-07-05 17:10:27,
78,Keir Starmer: From indie kid to prime minister,"Three years ago Sir Keir Starmer seriously considered quitting as Labour leader. It was 2021 and his party had just lost the Hartlepool by-election to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.  It was the first time Labour had ever lost the seat. Three short years feel like a political lifetime ago now.  Sir Keir has become only the fifth person in British history to take Labour from opposition to power.  His party has gone from a historic thumping at the general election in 2019 – to victory in 2024. The Hartlepool result though, is a reminder that Sir Keir’s journey to Downing Street was far from straightforward. In fact, for a long time his life and career were on a very different path. Keir Starmer, one of four children, was brought up in the town of Oxted on the Kent-Surrey border. He was raised by his toolmaker father and nurse mother, who suffered from a debilitating form of arthritis known as Still’s disease. Sir Keir has spoken about the challenges of growing up at a time of high inflation in the 1970s. “If you’re working class, you’re scared of debt,” he said during the election campaign.  “My mum and dad were scared of debt, so they would choose the bill that they wouldn’t pay.” The choice was the phone bill. Sir Keir had a lot going on in his younger years.  He was obsessed with football (on the centre-left of midfield, of course). He was a talented musician and learnt violin with Norman Cook, who went on to become chart-topping DJ Fatboy Slim. Sir Keir also had a rebellious streak. He and his friends were once caught by police illegally selling ice-cream on a French beach to raise cash. But what about politics? There were always clues, including his name which was given to him as a tribute to the first leader of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie.  Sir Keir dabbled in left-wing politics over the course of his pre-parliamentary life.  That started at school, when he joined the Young Socialists, Labour’s youth movement. After school, Sir Keir became the first person in his family to go to university, studying law at Leeds University and later at Oxford.  At Leeds, he was influenced by the indie music of the 1980s, from The Smiths and The Wedding Present to Orange Juice and Aztec Camera. His biographer, Tom Baldwin, notes his favourite drink as a student was a mix of beer and cider - or Snakebite - and he had a taste for curry and chips. For a while after graduating, Sir Keir lived above a brothel in north London. More importantly, he was building a reputation as a workaholic that would see him go on to become a successful and prominent human rights lawyer. At the same time, Sir Keir continued his left-wing activism, as a prominent contributor to the magazine Socialist Lawyer.  But politics was a side interest and, for much of the next 20 years, his legal career was his focus. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions, the chief prosecutor for England and Wales. Sir Keir likes to talk about this period in life as an example of his dedication to public service, and often recalls his role in prosecuting terrorist gangs. But what else? Under the 2010-15 coalition government, he had to implement significant cuts, with the Crown Prosecution Service’s budget reduced by more than a quarter. He also oversaw high-profile decisions including the prosecution of MPs over their parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal and prosecuting the then Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne for asking his wife to take speeding points for him. Sir Keir's legal work was rewarded with a knighthood in 2014. But how successful was his leadership?  Towards the end of his tenure, Sir Keir admitted in a BBC interview that vulnerable victims were still being let down by the justice system. It wasn't until the age of 52 that the career change came.  Sir Keir was selected for a safe Labour seat in north London, winning comfortably. He and his predecessor Rishi Sunak became MPs on the same day. But it wasn’t a happy time for the Labour Party.  The Conservatives had just won the general election and a bitter factional battle loomed after Jeremy Corbyn became leader. Much has been said and written about Sir Keir’s journey from backbencher to the Labour leadership – and now to Downing Street. But some things are worth highlighting. When he became leader, Jeremy Corbyn made Sir Keir shadow immigration minister but it didn’t last long.  He resigned after less than a year, one of dozens of frontbenchers who quit after the Brexit referendum in an attempt to force Mr Corbyn out. When that failed, and Mr Corbyn saw off a leadership challenge, Sir Keir returned to the fold as shadow Brexit secretary. Sir Keir’s position on Mr Corbyn has evolved over time.  In 2019, he was asked on BBC Breakfast to repeat the sentence “Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister”. He did.  A few months later, he would tell the BBC he was “100%” behind Mr Corbyn and working with him to win a general election.  While others refused to serve under Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir stayed in the tent and helped persuade the leader to back a second Brexit referendum at the 2019 election. That election was a disaster for Labour. Mr Corbyn quit and Sir Keir won the race to replace him.  But when he took over, a lot of people thought Boris Johnson was destined to govern for some time.  Many saw Sir Keir as a leader who could help rebuild – but few thought he was the man who would take them back to power. When did that change? The polls give us a good indication.  Sir Keir’s Labour trailed Mr Johnson’s Conservatives in the polls for much of 2020 and 2021 when the Hartlepool by-election was held.  But that started to change after the first reports of Downing Street parties during the pandemic, when strict restrictions were in place around social gatherings. There is a clear point in the polls where Labour overtakes the Conservatives in November 2021.  Its lead increased significantly after the Liz Truss mini budget and has been consistent and significant ever since. Sir Keir’s allies argue that wouldn’t have happened without big changes in the Labour Party. Sir Keir has sometimes been ruthless.  Jeremy Corbyn was thrown out of the parliamentary party and ultimately barred from standing as a Labour candidate.  Economic policy was tightened; meaning policies were junked if they weren’t seen as affordable.  Sir Keir embraced British patriotism, using the union jack as a backdrop for speeches and getting his conference to sing God Save the King. All of that has contributed to Sir Keir’s message of change. He spent the campaign arguing he had changed Labour and could change the country too. The election result will also mean change for the Starmer family.  Sir Keir, now 61, married his wife Victoria in 2007. Her intention is to keep working for the NHS in occupational health as he serves as prime minister.  Lady Starmer has been seen at some high-profile events like conference speeches, a rally last week – and at a Taylor Swift gig. But she is unlikely to play as prominent a role in public life as some partners have in the past. Sir Keir though has been candid about the impact high office could have, particularly on his teenage son and daughter.  He told the BBC in 2021: “I am worried about my children. That is probably the single thing that does keep me awake – as to how we will protect them through this.” It’s a challenge the Starmers will now face as they move into Downing Street at the end of a testing, far from straightforward, journey.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4y9evzzppo,"Nick Eardley,",2024-07-05 12:10:27,

89,US cities can now punish homelessness. Will it help or hurt a crisis?,"""I still have 20 more minutes before I have to move,"" Anthony yelled from his green tent on a Hollywood sidewalk as he heard footsteps approaching. Officials in Los Angeles had come by earlier to warn him that he could face arrest if he didn't move his belongings. They told him about the recent Supreme Court opinion that opened the door for cities and states across the US to punish anyone sleeping outdoors — the most significant ruling on homelessness since at least the 1980s, when many experts say the modern US homeless crisis began. It's added to the lengthy list of worries Anthony says he already has. ""I’m just trying to survive,” he told the BBC while lying down in his tent, using a blue backpack as a pillow. A black trash bag sits inside, filled with what belongings he can carry as he moves from one area to the next. “Some nights I don’t get no sleep,” he said. “I’ve been tired all day. I just want to lay somewhere comfortable and get a good nap in. And that’s it. I am not bothering nobody.” Moments later, Anthony packed up his tent and went looking for a new place to call home. The high court’s ruling is already having a ripple effect on cities across the country, which have been emboldened to take harsher measures to clear out homeless camps that have grown in the aftermath of the pandemic. Many US cities have been wrestling with how to combat the growing crisis. The issue has been at the heart of recent election cycles on the West Coast, where officials have poured record amounts of money into creating shelters and building affordable housing. Leaders face mounting pressure as long-term solutions - from housing and shelters to voluntary treatment services and eviction help - take time. “It’s not easy and it will take a time to put into place solutions that work, so there’s a little bit of political theatre going on here,"" Scout Katovich, an attorney who focuses on these issues for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told the BBC. ""Politicians want to be able to say they’re doing something,” The problem, Ms Katovich and other advocates say, is arresting or fining the homeless will only worsen the problem. “This tactic simply kicks the can down the road. Sure, you might clean up a street but the people you arrest will surely be back.” The high court's ruling last week didn’t mandate how cities and governments should handle homelessness - but it gave communities leeway to take more severe measures without the fear of legal recourse.  The case began in the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, with a population of around 40,000. Over the last 20 years the city doubled in size, but its supply of affordable and public housing did not keep up. Housing prices skyrocketed and the number of homeless grew.  Elected leaders passed laws allowing the city to issue $295 (£230) fines - or 20-day jail sentences for repeat offenses - to unhoused people sleeping or camping in public. Three homeless people sued the city in 2018 after they received multiple citations they were unable to pay.  An appeals court found such laws virtually banned homelessness and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.  The Supreme Court finally ruled that cities were clear to prohibit homeless people sleeping outside in public places.  “A handful of federal judges cannot begin to ‘match’ the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding ‘how best to handle’ a pressing social question like homelessness,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority's opinion.  Theane Evangelis argued this case before the Supreme Court on behalf of Grants Pass.  She says city officials had their hands tied because they could not force anyone into a shelter. She argues those who refuse to use the services offered end up staying in encampments.  “Living in tents is not a compassionate solution, and it's not treating people with dignity. And so the Supreme Court's decision was remarkable in the degree to which it listened to those cities,” she said. Leaders in Grants Pass say they plan to examine the Supreme Court opinion before making a plan on whether to enforce its ban on encampments.  The ruling comes at a critical time for the unhoused.  Last year, the US tracked the highest numbers of homeless people since 2007 - when the US Department of Housing and Urban Development started tracking such data. There were 653,104 homeless people counted as part of the agency's yearly homeless assessment in 2023. That's a nearly 11% increase from the year prior. The ACLU has been tracking the reaction to the decision by city leaders across the US.  It has  already sent a letter to Manchester, New Hampshire, after the mayor promised to ban encampments to “make our streets safe, clear and passable”. Other city leaders, like the mayor in Lancaster, California, have promised to “be much more aggressive” against encampments in neighbourhoods and near stores. Mayor R Rex Parris told the Los Angeles Times “we’re going to be moving them really fast”. State lawmakers in Oregon also seem poised to look at changing laws that will give them greater latitude to rid homeless camps, local media reported. In Spokane, Washington, leaders are asking authorities to dismantle more camps. But fining people who don’t have the means for housing worsens their finances, advocates say.  Arresting them can make it harder to find a job or housing, experts told the BBC. “There is mounds and volumes of evidence showing that having an unpaid citation and a warrant out for arrest, let alone in incarceration, prevents people from accessing housing, jobs in other places,"" Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California in Los Angeles told the BBC.  ""It actually prevents people from accessing shelter.”  Not all cities have welcomed the court decision.  In Los Angeles, the mayor called the  ruling “disappointing” and vowed to continue investing in affordable housing, voluntary treatment and eviction protections. Days after the opinion, the city released a homeless count showing the first drop in nearly six years. Advocates say it is a prime example that other cities can learn from. “Real change takes time,” Sasha Morozov, a regional director for PATH, a leading homeless provider in the Los Angeles area, told the BBC. Ms Morozov noted, though, outreach teams in the greater Los Angeles area are still working to inform those living on the streets about the Supreme Court’s ruling. Teams are also preparing for increased demand for legal services. Around the corner from Anthony, Topher Williams, 28, calls a makeshift tent on a sidewalk home.  Black and blue tarps are tied to tree branches and street parking poles. Plywood boards line the edges of the structure, which he calls a three-room apartment. Mr Williams, who told the BBC he was an Army veteran, has been living on the streets for four years. An unlucky combination of medical expenses and the pandemic's economic struggles left him without a job or shelter. Like Anthony, he’s frustrated at the lack of compassion from city officials and law enforcement. “It's mind blowing the way people look at us. The way people straight up treat us like we're like less than animals. And they have no idea,” he said, tears welling in his eyes. “I served eight years in the military. I did two tours of duty. I gave the ultimate sacrifice fighting for this country, and to be treated like I’m a second-class citizen is wild.” Asked if he was scared about potential arrests, he said it's part of this way of life.  “We’ve got a lot that we have to deal with already. A lot of the things are kind of stressful. But I don’t worry about things until they start affecting me.” Like Topher, Anthony said being arrested may not be the worst outcome. “At least I’ll have a bed and maybe I’ll be in the system and get the right kind of help.”",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y8jj64y5o,"Sam Granville and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-05 01:10:28,
92,What's happened in UK election and what comes next?,"Sir Keir Starmer is the UK's new prime minister, after his Labour Party swept to power in a landslide general election victory. The Conservative Party suffered a dramatic collapse after a tumultuous 14 years in power, which saw five different prime ministers run the country. It lost 250 seats over the course of a devastating night.  Rishi Sunak - the outgoing PM - accepted responsibility for the result and apologised to defeated colleagues during a brief statement outside a rainy 10 Downing Street. He said he would resign as party leader in the coming weeks. In his first speech as prime minister after greeting dozens of jubilant Labour supporters who had lined Downing Street, Sir Keir vowed to run a ""government of service"" and to kick start a period of ""national renewal"".  ""For too long we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity,"" he said. ""I want to say very clearly to those people. Not this time.""  ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while, but have no doubt the work of change will begin immediately.""  The result marks a stunning reversal from the 2019 election when Labour, led by the veteran left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, suffered its worst electoral defeat in almost a century.  On the other side, Robert Buckland, a former Conservative minister who lost his seat, described it as ""electoral Armageddon"" for the Tories. It is the party's worst result in almost 200 years, with an ideological battle over its future direction expected ahead.  It's been a long night of results. Here's what it all means. Britain's House of Commons has 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of their ""seats"" represents a constituency, or district. So far Labour has won 412 seats, while the Conservatives have slumped to just 121 and centrist Liberal Democrats have taken 71. Reform UK, a successor to the Brexit Party, is set to pick up four seats, as is the left-wing Green Party.  There is just one seat left to be declared, in Scotland, for the constituency of Skye and Ross-shire.  Labour's surge was partly aided by the collapse of the Scottish National Party (SNP). The party has been hit by a succession of controversies around its finances and fell to just nine seats overnight. The expected 170-seat majority in the House of Commons for Labour is an enormous number but still short of the majority of 179 won by the party under Tony Blair in the 1997 election.  But for more perspective, the Conservatives' win in the 2019 election under Boris Johnson - seen as a very strong performance - saw them get a majority of 80 seats.  A reminder: If a party holds a majority, it means it doesn't need to rely on other parties to pass laws. The bigger the majority, the easier it is. There were, however, a number of notable defeats for Labour to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza tickets - especially in areas with large Muslim populations.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance to the conflict. In February, the party called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but critics said it was too slow to reach that position.  Centre-left parties in other Western countries were keeping a keen eye on the trend ahead of the poll, amid fear of a growing backlash from their own voters over their support for Israel.  As constituencies have declared their results live on television - with all candidates lined up next to each other on stage - there were some major moments. Perhaps the most notable was the defeat of Liz Truss. The former prime minister served just 49 days in Number 10 before being ousted by her party. She narrowly lost to Labour in the constituency of South West Norfolk, having previously held a huge 24,180 majority. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative business secretary and arch-Brexiteer, was another of the biggest names to suffer defeat. He lost his East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour.  He told the BBC that he couldn't ""blame anybody other than myself"" for the loss but he took a ""small silver lining"" from the fact that the Conservatives would be ""at least the official opposition"" - a reference to fears they wouldn't even have that. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, looked rattled after losing his seat in southern England.  Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, who ran against Rishi Sunak for the party leadership before he became prime minister, lost her seat in Portsmouth. As the night wore on, a succession of other Conservative cabinet ministers also lost their seats, including Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer.  But Jeremy Hunt, who served as chancellor - the UK equivalent of a finance minister - held on to his seat but with a much-reduced majority. Mr Sunak also won his seat in Yorkshire with a comfortable majority of about 12,000 -  but used his acceptance speech to concede and confirm his party had lost the election.  Labour lost two big names of their own. Jonathan Ashworth and Thangam Debbonaire were both expected to be a part of Keir Starmer's incoming cabinet.  Things move pretty fast in British politics - there is very little time between an election result and the installation of the new prime minister.  By mid-morning moving vans had arrived to help Rishi Sunak out of 10 Downing Street. He was then whisked away to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.  Then, just 14 hours after the initial exit poll dropped, Sir Keir was formally invited by the monarch to form the next government. Moments later - watched by the world's media - he walked up Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time as prime minster.  He has already started appointing a new cabinet.  Angela Rayner has been made deputy prime minister, while Rachel Reeves has become the first female chancellor.  Meanwhile David Lammy is the new foreign secretary with Yvette Cooper as home secretary. Speaking before he handed his resignation to the King, Mr Sunak wished the new PM well.  ""His successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent public spirited man who I respect.""    He's fairly new to politics, relatively speaking. Sir Keir started his professional life as a barrister in the 1990s, and was appointed the director of public prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, in 2008. He was first elected in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency in north London in 2015, and took over leadership of Labour after the party's poor 2019 general election, pledging to start a ""new era"" after the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir was re-elected in the same constituency on Thursday, saying in his victory speech people were ""ready for change"" and promising an ""end the politics of performance"". ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community, your future,"" he said. ""You have voted. It's now time for us to deliver."" The Labour leader largely avoided making big pledges during the campaign. But during his address outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said his government would strive to ""rebuild"" British public services such as the NHS, slash energy bills and secure the country's border.  ""You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change,"" he vowed.  You can read Sir Keir's full profile here. This election's insurgent party was Reform UK, the right-wing successor to the Brexit Party and the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage, its leader, finally won a seat on his eighth attempt - but his party's initial projection of 13 seats fizzled to four. That's still better than UKIP and the Brexit Party ever did, and Mr Farage has been celebrating. The party's share of the vote looks to be about 14%. Reform drew controversy during the campaign over offensive statements made by some of its candidates and activists.  Mr Farage will be joined in the House of Commons by former Conservative party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, Reform founder Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe. From their new perch in parliament, the party could seek to cause trouble for the Conservatives and pick off more voters from the party's remaining base.

91,Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?,"Three decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of ""fulfilment centres"", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. ""For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',"" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. ""It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,"" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by ""living in a cave"". So the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over ""severe"" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: ""What the heck is left?"" ""Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?"" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to ""keep taking swings"" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a ""whole graveyard of bad ideas"" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention ""in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century"", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. ""Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,"" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziukėnas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. ""It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,"" he says. Amanda Mull points to another priority for Amazon in the years ahead: staving off competition from Chinese rivals like Temu and Shein. Amazon, she says, has ""created the spending habits"" of western consumers by acting as a trusted intermediary between them and Chinese manufacturers, and bolting on to that easy returns and lightening fast delivery. But remove that last element of the deal and you can bring prices down, as the Chinese retailers have done. ""They have said 'well, if you wait a week or 10 days for something that you're just buying on a lark, we can give it to you for almost nothing,'"" says Ms Mull - a proposition that is appealing to many people, especially during a cost of living crisis. Juozas Kaziukėnas is not so sure - suggesting the new retailers will remain ""niche"", and it will take something much more fundamental to challenge Amazon's position. ""For as long as going shopping involves going to a search bar - Amazon has nailed that,"" he says. Thirty years ago a fledging company spotted emerging trends around internet use and realised how it could upend first retail, then much else besides. Mr Kaziukėnas says for that to happen again will take a similar leap of imagination, perhaps around AI.

87,Andrew Tate free to leave Romania but not the EU,"Controversial influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are free to leave Romania but not the EU, a Bucharest court has ruled.  They had previously been banned from leaving the country where they are awaiting trial, indicted on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. They deny all allegations against them.  The decision to allow freedom of movement in the EU is not final and can be appealed. The brothers said the move represented a ""significant victory and major step forward"" in their ongoing case.  The brothers' lawyer, Eugene Vidineac, called the ruling a ""reflection of the exemplary behaviour and assistance of my clients.  ""Andrew and Tristan are still determined to clear their name and reputation; however, they are grateful to the courts for placing this trust in them."" Posting on X, a platform from which he was previously banned, Andrew Tate said: ""The sham case is falling apart."" The Tate brothers, former kickboxers who are dual UK-US nationals, are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the brothers in an indictment published in June last year, and seven alleged victims were identified. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence against him and there is a conspiracy to silence him. The internet personalities are also wanted in the UK over sexual offences allegedly committed there. The brothers have had restrictions on their movement for the past two years.  They were held in police custody during the criminal investigation from late December 2022 until April 2023, before being placed under house arrest until August, when courts put them under judicial control.

86,Sunak's 'dismal end' and 'bland' Starmer: World media reacts to UK election,"By BBC Monitoring and Matthew Davis The Conservatives have emerged with ""broken bones"" from the UK election after Rishi Sunak's ""dismal end"" - but the big question for some in the international media is whether the ""bland, even boring"" Keir Starmer can clean up the UK's ""mess"". Labour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time.  For Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean ""the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders"", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile. Voters ""were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,"" the paper says, adding that ""Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party"". German business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result ""opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit"". ""Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,"" the paper said. Mr Farage’s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an “election earthquake”, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives. French media largely hails Labour’s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader’s success in Clacton, ""the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader"". According to Le Monde, the UK’s return to the centre-left is ""striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections"". Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: ""The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced."" Conservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer “a reassuring institutional alternative”. But for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as “a bit bland, even boring”. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, “previous leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results”. In Hungary, the press there noted two issues: “Unchanged support for Ukraine”, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for “a more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,” said the left-wing paper Telex.  The New York Times casts Labour's victory as ""a seismic moment in the UK’s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s"". But it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots. ""The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters’ faith in mainstream politics,"" the Times says. For ABC News, Rishi Sunak’s campaign to remain Britain’s prime minister showed a lack of political touch. ""Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters."" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May — ""with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,"" the broadcaster said. Meanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: ""The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos."" ""Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,"" the paper said. By Rupsha Mukherjee  Most TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat.  “British Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,” The Times of India noted. The Wire website called it ""a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government"". Everything Sunak tried during the campaign “really failed”, Times Now TV added. “Everyone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat."" But the Labour win “is also a triumph for India”, one news site thought, suggesting that Sir Keir Starmer would seek better relations with Delhi. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring China team China’s only official statement so far has been via its foreign ministry, which said China “had noticed the results of the British election” and “we hope to get Sino-UK relations along the right track”. Despite these hopes, state media outlets were not overly optimistic.  “With six prime ministers in eight years, can Starmer clean up the UK’s mess?” asked broadcaster CCTV. Given the next government faces “the most challenging issues in 70 years”,  “public dissatisfaction” might soon follow, mused The Paper.  The Global Times, however, published a positive profile of the prime minister-to-be, saying Sir Keir was “not the inflammatory politician that people imagine”, and that media impressions of him are that he is “conscientious, good at management, and a little dull”.  China can hope for a more pragmatic relationship with the UK, the paper said. By Anastasia Bazenkova and Yuriy Martynenko Russia’s state-controlled TV channels have presented the UK election result as a “miserable failure” and a ""crushing defeat"" for the Conservative party and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. State channel Rossiya 1 said that Brexit was the only achievement of 14 years of Conservative rule and Channel One objected to how Russia had been cast in the election in the UK, which has helped rally Western opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.  “This election, like politics in general in Britain in recent years, just can’t manage without an enemy figure in the form of Russia,"" the channel said. Outlets and commentators in both Russia and Ukraine don't expect the election to change UK policies toward Russia. “For Moscow [Keir Starmer's] arrival in power changes nothing, since he takes anti-Russian positions and supports continued backing for Ukraine,” said NTV, another leading Russian channel. Pro-government paper Izvestiya thought anyway that: “Political changes in Europe show that for the electorate, internal issues are becoming much more important than Ukraine.” In Ukraine, the country’s national wartime news service Suspilne thought the same. ""For the first time in 14 years, power will change hands in the UK, but this will not have an impact on support for Ukraine,"" the news service said.

85,What went wrong for the Conservatives?,"The Conservative Party had become accustomed to almost being the Manchester City of politics. A blue, winning machine for so long that some of its key players could barely remember anything else. But their streak - that delivered Tory prime ministers in four elections in a row - has been brought to a dramatic end. Many Tories, both winners and losers, are almost speechless and still processing it. One told me they were simply ""not coherent"". A post-mortem on what went wrong with their tactics and leadership, and where to go next, is now beginning. When I speak to Conservatives, several themes come up repeatedly. Some feel Labour's policy offering was not drastically different to theirs, but think the choice became more about perceptions of ""competence"".  They have had five leaders, and prime ministers, in less than 10 years. Seismic events, from Brexit to Covid to multiple leadership contests, splintered the party into ideological factions. Some Tories spent more energy plotting to take each other down than their opposition - and never really patched things up. Scandals rocked the party in a whack-a-mole fashion, from lockdown parties to sexual misconduct allegations to a mini-budget that contributed to raising interest rates. An election betting saga was the cherry on top. When I asked former Chief Whip Sir Mark Spencer during the campaign if the party had a conduct problem, he mentioned that other parties also had to suspend MPs for poor behaviour - which is true - but conceded this had become too regular. Then there was the undoubted desire for change - a word Labour deployed in its campaign. The cost of living, NHS waiting lists, and small boats were all issues voters raised on the doorstep - and felt had been getting worse, not better. Nigel Farage's late return to the fray meant the latter theme became a particular thorn in Tory sides, with some right-leaning voters who switched to Reform UK wanting tougher immigration policies and lower taxes. Rhetoric and policies attempting to win them back alienated some more centrist Tories who abandoned the party for Labour or the Liberal Democrats, leaving the Tories pincered in between. This was a more comfortable switch for some centrists who didn’t feel they could vote Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. Did these circumstances mean defeat was inevitable? Most Tories I've spoken to describe the result as ""not unexpected"", but some feel the scale of it could have been mitigated. There were avoidable gaffes - like Rishi Sunak leaving D-day commemorations early. While Boris Johnson was prone to gaffes too, some of his fans felt Mr Sunak didn’t charm voters back in the same way. The former prime minister still yielded chants of ‘Boris! Boris!’ at an eleventh-hour rally to try to energise the campaign. There is still a lingering bafflement among some about why Mr Sunak decided to call the election in July. Their campaign guru, Isaac Levido, had argued for a later date - hoping by then there would be more ""measurables"" to demonstrate their policies were having an impact. A flight of asylum seekers taking off to Rwanda, for example, or an interest rate cut. But he lost that argument. And the Conservatives had little evidence in their armoury of some of their policies working when they went to the electorate. The risk of the alternative, Mr Levido's critics argued, was that more bad news could come down the road for the Tories - more Channel crossings this summer, more offenders being released because of prison overcrowding, universities going under. But policy and identity wise, what else could the Conservatives have done? That's where their focus will lie now as a search for the soul of the party begins. Mr Sunak has confirmed he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to choose his successor. There have been murmurings for the last few weeks about whether an interim leader is appointed to avoid the awkwardness of, for example, the former PM having to do Prime Minister's Questions from the opposition benches.  Could this be someone who served in the cabinet previously - like Sir Oliver Dowden, James Cleverly, or even Jeremy Hunt, who just about scraped back into the Commons?  If so, it would probably need to be someone who doesn't actually want to run for leader full time. Otherwise, Mr Sunak could stay on until the next Tory leadership contest concludes. There are some MPs who have been working behind the scenes for a long time on shoring up their support, including Kemi Badenoch (the bookies' favourite) who is on the right of the party, and Tom Tugendhat, who is more to the centre.  Former contenders like Suella Braverman and former Sunak ally-turned-critic Robert Jenrick are tipped to run too. They both spent time in the Home Office, are on the right of the party, and have criticised the government's record on immigration. One interesting thing to note, though, is who the remaining Tory MPs are, and what that might mean for who wins support among the parliamentary party. I've had a quick skim over the new intake of Tory MPs and who they backed in the first Tory leadership contest of July-September 2022. Interestingly, the majority are Sunak-backers, with a hefty chunk of Liz Truss supporters too. Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have lost a couple of their key allies on the right of the parliamentary party. A couple of Mr Tugendhat’s backers are gone too. Why do the leanings of the remaining MPs matter? Well, partly because this will determine how the Tory party decides to shape itself going forward. Does it decide to elect someone on the right of the party, like Ms Badenoch, Mrs Braverman or Mr Jenrick, to try to stave off the growing influence of Reform UK who have now won several seats? Some in the party argue not being tougher on issues like immigration was part of their downfall. Or does it try to shift back toward the centre ground with a candidate like Mr Tugendhat or Mr Hunt to reclaim some of the space Labour is now trying to occupy on the political spectrum?  Some in the party argue the Tories' drift to the right was part of the problem, and alienated socially liberal, but fiscally conservative, voters. The answer will be the result of a lot of tussling and soul-searching over the weeks to come.",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng05k1z0eo,"Ione Wells,",2024-07-05 16:10:28,
84,Jailed Russian dissident moved to prison hospital,"Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was jailed after criticising President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine, has been taken to a prison hospital, his wife says. Evgenia Kara-Murza said on X that officials refused to comment on his condition when his lawyers tried to visit him. Last year Mr Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-British citizen, was jailed and transferred to a prison colony in Siberia. His wife says he suffers from a neurological condition as a result of poisonings. Mr Kara-Murza, 42, has accused Russian authorities of trying to poison him in 2015 and 2017. On Friday, lawyers for the dissident arrived at the Omsk prison colony but were not told where he was for five hours and then not permitted to visit him in hospital, Evgenia Kara-Murza says.  The outspoken critic of the Kremlin was arrested in April 2022. In 2023 he was sentenced to 25 years for spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". He has criticised President Vladimir Putin over the Russian government's crackdown on dissent and the war in Ukraine. He had also played a key role in persuading Western governments to sanction Russian officials for human rights abuses and corruption. The US state department has described Mr Kara-Murza as ""yet another target of the Russian government's escalating campaign of repression"".

93,Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?,"US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing. Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics.  Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead. Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn. Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft"".  The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by. Mr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project.  “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,"" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery.  On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. “It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.” However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. “It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.” Regulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft. Mr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. “The FAA has always been super risk averse. That’s their business!” Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he’s put  “my entire adult life” into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business. Mr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board. Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%. But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment. The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier. “Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says. Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat"".

95,Israel settlements drive heightens Palestinian land angst,"Palestinian officials have condemned a dramatic new settlement drive by Israel in the occupied West Bank which includes retroactively authorising three outposts. The move is set to further stoke tensions in the territory which has seen a surge in violence since the war in Gaza began on 7 October. Palestinians claim the West Bank as part of their hoped-for future state.  Settlements are widely seen as illegal under international law although Israel disagrees. The three unauthorised outposts that have now been legalised under Israeli law were described as new neighbourhoods of existing settlements.  They are in sensitive areas in the Jordan Valley and near the southern city of Hebron. In addition, the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said on Thursday that Israeli authorities had approved or advanced plans for 5,295 homes in dozens of settlements. It also emerged this week that the Israeli government’s Higher Planning Council had approved the largest seizure of West Bank land in over three decades. Some 12,700 dunams (5 sq miles) has been seized in the Jordan Valley and declared as Israeli state land. This year has marked a peak in the extent of declarations of state land with a total of 23,700 dunams affected. The Palestinian president’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdeinah, said the new announcements confirmed that Israel’s “extremist government is bound by the right-wing policy of war and settlement”.  He said the latest steps would not “achieve security and peace for anyone” and were meant to prevent the establishment of a geographically contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. Last week, Israel’s security cabinet decided to authorise retroactively five settlement outposts built without official government approval. The UN, the UK and other countries denounced the move as undermining hopes for the two-state solution - the internationally approved formula for peace that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. “Israel must halt its illegal settlement expansion and hold to account those responsible for extremist settler violence,” the British Foreign Office said. “The UK’s priority is to bring the Gaza conflict to a sustainable end as quickly as possible and ensure a lasting peace in the Middle East, through an irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution.” The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the overall strategy for the West Bank. However, the far-right Israeli minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, has welcomed the recent steps. ""We are building the good land and thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state,"" he said Wednesday on social media platform X. Not counting annexed east Jerusalem, about half a million settlers live in the West Bank alongside three million Palestinians. Last year, Mr Smotrich instructed government departments to prepare to double the number of settlers to one million. Since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, successive Israeli administrations have allowed settlements to grow.  However, expansion has risen sharply since Mr Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a hardline, pro-settler governing coalition. Last month, Peace Now released the recording of an address by Mr Smotrich to his Religious Zionism party, in which he proposes transferring the management of settlements from military to civilian officials, building a separate road bypass system for settlers,  expanding farming outposts and cracking down on unauthorised Palestinian construction. Peace Now warned that the plan would irreversibly change the way the West Bank was governed and lead to “de facto annexation”.",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq61w10qwpo,"Yolande Knell,",2024-07-05 17:10:29,
96,Victoria Starmer: Who is the new UK PM's wife?,"Throughout the general election campaign and much of her husband's tenure as Labour leader, Victoria Starmer has kept a low profile. Apart from appearances at Labour conferences, the odd state banquet and a Taylor Swift concert, Lady Starmer, nee Victoria Alexander, has sought to avoid public appearances  Asked on LBC about his wife's low profile, Sir Keir pointed out that she had a full-time job at an NHS hospital and that their eldest child was doing his GCSEs. “We took the decision that whilst I was out and about on the road, we wanted to create the environment where he could study calmly in ordinary circumstances.” However, now that Sir Keir has won the election and become prime minister, Lady Starmer may find it trickier to shun the spotlight.  When she first met Sir Keir in the early 2000s, he wasn't a politician but a barrister. She was a solicitor working on the same case.  Sir Keir told ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories, of their first meeting: ""I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate. ""I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said 'let's get her on the line.'"" He grilled her forensically on the paper but as he hung up he heard one comment from her. ""She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,"" Sir Keir said. ""And quite right too."" Despite the rocky beginnings, the relationship blossomed after a first date in the Lord Stanley pub in Camden, north London.  Speaking to his biographer Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir described her as ""grounded, sassy, funny, streetwise - and utterly gorgeous too"".  He proposed just a few months later on a holiday in Greece. ""Won't we need a ring, Keir?"" was her down-to-earth response.  They were married in 2007 at the Fennes estate in Essex, walking down the aisle to one of Sir Keir's favourite pieces of music - Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.5, 2nd movement. He later described her to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs as an ""incredibly warm, wonderful woman. My complete rock"". The couple have two teenage children - but have been at pains to keep them out of the limelight - making a point of not naming them in public.  Lady Starmer grew up in north London, not far from where she currently lives with her family.  She attended Channing School before studying law and sociology at Cardiff University. While there, she got involved in student politics, becoming president of the student union in 1994.  In an interview with the student newspaper Gair Rhydd, she said her main priority was to campaign against cuts to student grants.  Rob Watkins was at Cardiff University at the same time and worked as a photographer for the paper. He remembers the future Lady Starmer as being ""witty and professional, clearly dedicated to her work"" and aware of her responsibility to the people she represented.   Lady Starmer currently works in occupational health for the NHS - something her husband has frequently referred to during his time as Labour leader.  He says it gives him insight into the problems faced by the health service.  Speaking to the Times in May, Sir Keir said his wife intended to keep her job if he won the election.  “She’s absolutely going to carry on working, she wants to and she loves it."" While the couple say they want to keep life as normal as possible for their children, their domestic life has already been disrupted by Sir Keir's job. In April, pro-Palestinian demonstrators held a protest outside their home, hanging a banner outside their house and laying children's shoes outside the front door.

102,General election 2024 in maps and charts,"The Labour Party has won a landslide majority in the 2024 general election.  The party is set to take 412 seats with a majority of 174, with one result yet to be declared. It is the worst Conservative result in terms of seats in history, with the party forecast to win as few as 122. The Liberal Democrats have their highest tally since 1923, taking 71 seats. The SNP is forecast to finish with 10 seats. Reform UK have five and Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have four each.  Some 23 seats were won by other parties, all in Northern Ireland, and independent candidates. The biggest gap on record has emerged between the share of the vote won nationally by parties and the number of seats they have gained. Labour gained over 200 seats but their vote share increased by less than two percentage points to 34%. The Conservatives saw their vote share plummet by 20 points to 24% and the party lost 251 seats. Reform are in third place by share of the vote on 14% but they found it difficult to convert votes into seats. The party has returned five MPs, including party leader Nigel Farage in Clacton. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats’ 12% vote share translated into 71 seats. The Greens recorded their best ever general election performance, winning four seats and seven per cent of the vote.  This map shows the seats which have been won by a different party to the last general election. To see all the results use the ""Changed hands"" toggle.  All of the new seats Keir Starmer's party took came from constituencies won by either the SNP or the Tories at the last general election. A total of 182 seats changed from blue to red. All of Reform's gains came from seats previously won by the Conservative Party in 2019. Labour lost five seats to independent candidates, including former party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North. Labour also lost one seat, Leicester East, to the Conservatives and Bristol Central to the Greens. The Conservative vote share suffered particularly in areas where high numbers voted to leave the European Union, falling by 27 points in constituencies where more than 60% voted Leave. Labour support in constituencies with large Muslim communities fell about 23 points to 39%. Click through the slides on these maps to see constituency vote share by party. Scotland is the only part of the UK where Labour’s vote share rose sharply. It jumped by 17 points as the party took 36 seats from the SNP. The SNP share of the vote is down 15 points. They also lost three seats to the Liberal Democrats. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, lost his seat in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. The Conservatives lost 12 seats in Wales, meaning they now have no MPs there.  Labour gained nine seats, taking the party's total to 27, despite their share falling by four points. Plaid Cymru has gained two seats, putting the party on four and the Liberal Democrats have taken one seat. Sinn Féin has become Northern Ireland's largest Westminster party, winning all seven seats it won in 2019, while the Democratic Unionist Party lost three of the eight it held at the last general election. In a surprise result, Traditional Unionist Voice took North Antrim from the DUP, unseating Ian Paisley Jr.  Looking at seat and vote share change across broad areas of England, the Conservatives have lost more than 100 seats in the South excluding London and their vote share is down by about 24 points.  Labour has made seat gains in the Midlands, North and South and has also increased its already-strong London tally by seven seats.  The Liberal Democrats have increased their seats in the South by more than 40, their highest regional tally.  Labour and Lib Dem vote shares fell somewhat in London, while hardly changing in the North and Midlands. Vote share for the two parties rose slightly in the South.  Reform share is up in all of these broad regions.  Turnout across the UK as a whole is 60%, the second lowest in a UK election since 1885. Only 2001 was lower with 59%. It was lowest in Wales, where only 56% of the electorate voted. Northern Ireland had a turnout of 57%, Scotland 59% and England 60%. The lowest turnout of any constituency was 40% in Manchester Rusholme, where Afzal Khan held the seat for Labour. The bottom five for turnout also included Leeds South, Hull East, Blaenau Gwent & Rhymney and Tipton & Wednesbury.

101,UK election: What's happened and what comes next?,"Sir Keir Starmer is the UK's new prime minister, after his Labour Party swept to power in a landslide general election victory. The Conservative Party suffered a dramatic collapse after a tumultuous 14 years in power, which saw five different prime ministers run the country. It lost 250 seats over the course of a devastating night.  Rishi Sunak - the outgoing PM - accepted responsibility for the result and apologised to defeated colleagues during a brief statement outside a rainy 10 Downing Street. He said he would resign as party leader in the coming weeks. In his first speech as prime minister after greeting dozens of jubilant Labour supporters who had lined Downing Street, Sir Keir vowed to run a ""government of service"" and to kick start a period of ""national renewal"".  ""For too long we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity,"" he said. ""I want to say very clearly to those people. Not this time.""  ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while, but have no doubt the work of change will begin immediately.""  The result marks a stunning reversal from the 2019 election when Labour, led by the veteran left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, suffered its worst electoral defeat in almost a century.  On the other side, Robert Buckland, a former Conservative minister who lost his seat, described it as ""electoral Armageddon"" for the Tories. It is the party's worst result in almost 200 years, with an ideological battle over its future direction expected ahead.  It's been a long night of results. Here's what it all means. Britain's House of Commons has 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of their ""seats"" represents a constituency, or district. So far Labour has won 412 seats, while the Conservatives have slumped to just 121 and centrist Liberal Democrats have taken 71. Reform UK, a successor to the Brexit Party, is set to pick up four seats, as is the left-wing Green Party.  There is just one seat left to be declared, in Scotland, for the constituency of Skye and Ross-shire.  Labour's surge was partly aided by the collapse of the Scottish National Party (SNP). The party has been hit by a succession of controversies around its finances and fell to just nine seats overnight. The expected 170-seat majority in the House of Commons for Labour is an enormous number but still short of the majority of 179 won by the party under Tony Blair in the 1997 election.  But for more perspective, the Conservatives' win in the 2019 election under Boris Johnson - seen as a very strong performance - saw them get a majority of 80 seats.  A reminder: If a party holds a majority, it means it doesn't need to rely on other parties to pass laws. The bigger the majority, the easier it is. There were, however, a number of notable defeats for Labour to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza tickets - especially in areas with large Muslim populations.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance to the conflict. In February, the party called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but critics said it was too slow to reach that position.  Centre-left parties in other Western countries were keeping a keen eye on the trend ahead of the poll, amid fear of a growing backlash from their own voters over their support for Israel.  As constituencies have declared their results live on television - with all candidates lined up next to each other on stage - there were some major moments. Perhaps the most notable was the defeat of Liz Truss. The former prime minister served just 49 days in Number 10 before being ousted by her party. She narrowly lost to Labour in the constituency of South West Norfolk, having previously held a huge 24,180 majority. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative business secretary and arch-Brexiteer, was another of the biggest names to suffer defeat. He lost his East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour.  He told the BBC that he couldn't ""blame anybody other than myself"" for the loss but he took a ""small silver lining"" from the fact that the Conservatives would be ""at least the official opposition"" - a reference to fears they wouldn't even have that. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, looked rattled after losing his seat in southern England.  Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, who ran against Rishi Sunak for the party leadership before he became prime minister, lost her seat in Portsmouth. As the night wore on, a succession of other Conservative cabinet ministers also lost their seats, including Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer.  But Jeremy Hunt, who served as chancellor - the UK equivalent of a finance minister - held on to his seat but with a much-reduced majority. Mr Sunak also won his seat in Yorkshire with a comfortable majority of about 12,000 -  but used his acceptance speech to concede and confirm his party had lost the election.  Labour lost two big names of their own. Jonathan Ashworth and Thangam Debbonaire were both expected to be a part of Keir Starmer's incoming cabinet.  Things move pretty fast in British politics - there is very little time between an election result and the installation of the new prime minister.  By mid-morning moving vans had arrived to help Rishi Sunak out of 10 Downing Street. He was then whisked away to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.  Then, just 14 hours after the initial exit poll dropped, Sir Keir was formally invited by the monarch to form the next government. Moments later - watched by the world's media - he walked up Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time as prime minster.  He has already started appointing a new cabinet.  Angela Rayner has been made deputy prime minister, while Rachel Reeves has become the first female chancellor.  Meanwhile David Lammy is the new foreign secretary with Yvette Cooper as home secretary. Speaking before he handed his resignation to the King, Mr Sunak wished the new PM well.  ""His successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent public spirited man who I respect.""    He's fairly new to politics, relatively speaking. Sir Keir started his professional life as a barrister in the 1990s, and was appointed the director of public prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, in 2008. He was first elected in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency in north London in 2015, and took over leadership of Labour after the party's poor 2019 general election, pledging to start a ""new era"" after the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir was re-elected in the same constituency on Thursday, saying in his victory speech people were ""ready for change"" and promising an ""end the politics of performance"". ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community, your future,"" he said. ""You have voted. It's now time for us to deliver."" The Labour leader largely avoided making big pledges during the campaign. But during his address outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said his government would strive to ""rebuild"" British public services such as the NHS, slash energy bills and secure the country's border.  ""You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change,"" he vowed.  You can read Sir Keir's full profile here. This election's insurgent party was Reform UK, the right-wing successor to the Brexit Party and the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage, its leader, finally won a seat on his eighth attempt - but his party's initial projection of 13 seats fizzled to four. That's still better than UKIP and the Brexit Party ever did, and Mr Farage has been celebrating. The party's share of the vote looks to be about 14%. Reform drew controversy during the campaign over offensive statements made by some of its candidates and activists.  Mr Farage will be joined in the House of Commons by former Conservative party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, Reform founder Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe. From their new perch in parliament, the party could seek to cause trouble for the Conservatives and pick off more voters from the party's remaining base.

98,Evenepoel wins time-trial as Pogacar stays in yellow,"Remco Evenepoel won his first Tour de France stage Remco Evenepoel claimed his first victory at the Tour de France in stage seven's individual time-trial as Tadej Pogacar held on to the leader's yellow jersey. The Belgian, who is the current world time trial champion, underlined his credentials as one of the favourites in the general classification, with a superb run on 25.3km course to finish 12 seconds ahead of Slovenia's Pogacar. Evenepoel, 24, who thought he had suffered a puncture on the approach towards the finish in Gevrey-Chambertin, is now just 33 seconds behind Pogacar overall. Another Slovenian, Primoz Roglic was third 34 seconds down, while defending champion Jonas Vingegaard conceded 37 seconds in fourth.  The Dane now trails by one minute and 15 seconds in the GC after also losing time on stage four. Simon Yates was the top-placed British rider in the time-trial, finishing 1:33 behind Evenepoel. The stage win gives Evenepoel, who is wearing the white jersey as the best young rider in the race so far, stage victories in all three Grand Tours. ""It's crazy. I enjoyed every metre of this time trial and coming out with the win was simply amazing,"" said the Soudal-Quick Step rider. ""We wanted a stage win, and that is done. It's a perfect day for me and my team. Mission accomplished. As for the rest of the Tour de France, I believe Tadej is going to be unreachable. But this is cycling, you never know what can happen.  ""I think the further into the race we go, the better I will feel, so I'll focus more on the podium because I feel I have the legs for it."" Before Friday's stage Pogacar had forecast that Evenepoel would be the man to beat in a discipline he excels in.  However, the two-time winner produced a determined ride of his own to extend his advantage over Roglic and Vingegaard, who will now see the mountain stages as their best opportunity to regain ground. ""I can be satisfied,"" Pogacar said.  ""I would have loved to have taken a stage win today but against Remco it's a bit tough. But I  gained time on Primoz [Roglic] and Jonas [Vingegaard] and the other guys so I can be really happy."" On Saturday, the Tour will take a lumpy 183.4km route from Semur-en-Auxois to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. Stage seven results 1. Remco Evenepoel (Bel/Soudal-Quick Step) 28mins 52secs 2.

97,Talk of easy draw shows 'entitlement' - Southgate,"This video can not be played The England team look in a different place mentally - Southgate England boss Gareth Southgate has warned against an ""entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents"" before Saturday's Euro 2024 quarter-final with Switzerland (17:00 BST). The Three Lions are two wins from the final after avoiding favourites Spain and France on the other side of the draw, meaning England cannot meet them before the showpiece in Berlin on 14 July. On the eve of the last-eight match with Switzerland - live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app - BBC sports editor Dan Roan asked Southgate whether England need to take the opportunity of being in the perceived easier side of the draw. ""We are playing a really strong football nation who have played exceptionally well, have enormous pride,"" said Southgate, who takes charge of his 100th game as boss. ""I would say that is a classic example of the entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents. ""Our focus is on how do we win this game and how do we play to the best of our ability? We have never been to a final outside England, we have only had two finals in our history, three semi-finals.  ""So lots of nations who we might perceive as English people to be smaller have far better records than us in terms of winning things, in getting to the latter stages in finals.  ""It's half of the problem we have. We're ready for tomorrow and, as a team, we have huge respect for our opponents."" Bellingham free to play against Switzerland  'Why three at the back can bring the best out of England' Why England could revert to back three at Euro 2024 England were seconds away from going out of Euro 2024 when Jude Bellingham scored a 95th-minute equaliser against Slovakia in the last 16.  Harry Kane then headed the winner in extra time to set up the quarter-final with Switzerland in Dusseldorf, with the winners facing the Netherlands or Turkey in the semis on Wednesday, 10 July (20:00 BST). England have produced four under-whelming performances at Euro 2024 but Southgate said he expected better against the Swiss. ""I feel that the team, even in training, now look in a different place mentally, they look more fluid,"" he added. ""The longer the players are here, the more belief they have, the less they are being affected by what's outside. They can see the opportunity. ""Every game can take you on a journey, like the game the other night. We have to deliver tomorrow, we have to be ready to go until the last minute again, dig deep in the moments that you have to.  ""They are highly motivated guys and can see the possibility of a semi-final. There is a buzz about them and they are excited to take that challenge on."" This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? With some fans venting their anger over the team's displays in Germany, Southgate's position has come under scrutiny. In February, the Football Association made it clear they were keen for him to remain in charge beyond Euro 2024. But Southgate, who steered England to the 2018 World Cup semi-final, the Euro 2020 final as well as a World Cup quarter-final in 2022, has yet to sign a new contract, with his current deal due to expire in December. There has been speculation about his future after the tournament - whether England win it or not. ""If you are in one of the most high-profile jobs in world football then there is always going to be speculation, always going to be assessment of what is going on,"" said Southgate. ""I'm not worried. When I was a young manager you are worried if the first job doesn't go well you will never get another job. You worry about failing and getting the sack.  ""I'm older, I'm not worried about losing, what might go wrong. We have an opportunity tomorrow to get to another semi-final.  ""It's about going for it now.""

100,Champion Alcaraz beats Tiafoe in five-set thriller,"This video can not be played Carlos Alcaraz defeats Frances Tiafoe in five-set thriller Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz avoided a surprise exit at Wimbledon by holding off American Frances Tiafoe in a five-set thriller. The Spaniard won an intense match 5-7 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 in front of a raucous Centre Court crowd. It keeps Alcaraz's hopes of winning back-to-back major titles alive after triumphing at the French Open last month. ""Obviously it is always a big challenge playing against Frances,"" said third seed Alcaraz. ""All I was thinking is 'fight one more ball'."" Friday's first match on the main show court lived up to the pair's previous meeting in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open. Alcaraz was the victor on that occasion as well, beating Tiafoe in a five-set epic on the way to winning his first Grand Slam title. World number one Jannik Sinner is also through to the last 16 after an emphatic 6-1 6-4 6-2 win against Miomir Kecmanovic. This video can not be played 'That was extraordinary!' - Daria Kasatkina tops shots of the day five Tiafoe was seeded 10th at Wimbledon last year, but he has since dropped down the rankings and suffered second-round exits at this year's Australian Open and French Open. Now 29th in the world rankings, he frustrated Alcaraz throughout and received the early backing of the crowd after coming back from a break down to take the opening set. ""He is a really talented player, really tough to face,"" Alcaraz added. ""He deserves to be at the top, he deserves to fight for big things."" Alcaraz, who had not dropped a set at the Championships until then, regained control in the second, but a single break of serve was enough for Tiafoe to win the third. The American waved to the crowd and pointed to his ears, calling for more noise under the closed Centre Court roof. The fans willingly obliged, cheering on the 26-year-old through the fourth set until it reached a tie-break after both players' serve held firm. Sensing the crowd were on his opponent's side, Alcaraz whipped up emotion with cries of ""vamos"" after striking huge winners and he cruised his way through to force a decider. From there it was plain sailing for the three-time major winner, who broke twice before raising his arms in celebration after sealing the victory with a delightful drop shot. He will play American Brandon Nakashima or French 16th seed Ugo Humbert in the fourth round.

Australian Open champion Sinner was one of those to benefit from the use of the show courts, featuring last on Centre Court to book his place in round four. The top seed raced through the first set in 21 minutes and was on course for a bagel after breaking opponent Kecmanovic twice, but the Serbian managed to salvage one game. World number 52 Kecmanovic found his feet in the second set but it was still all on Sinner's terms as he wrapped up the match in one hour and 36 minutes. Sinner will play either American 14th seed Ben Shelton or Canada's Denis Shapovalov next. Shelton leads Shapovalov 3-2 in the first set of their match, which will resume on Saturday at 13:00 BST on Court One after rain halted play on Friday.

104,Man City & Man Utd cleared by Uefa to play in Europe,"Manchester City won the Champions League for the first time in 2023 Manchester City and Manchester United have been cleared to take their places in European competition next season after conflicts over multi-club ownership with Girona and Nice respectively were resolved. However, United will be prevented from signing highly-rated Nice defender Jean-Clair Todibo by Uefa. City Football Group owns City and Girona, while Ineos controls the football operations of United and Nice, and Uefa does not allow clubs with the same ownership to be involved in the same competition. The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) of European football's governing body said on Friday ""significant changes"" had been made at Girona and Nice which would ""substantially restrict investors' influence and decision-making power"". In addition, shares have been transferred through independent trustees to a blind trust, which will be supervised by the CFCB. Among additional guarantees given by the City Football Group and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos Group to prove the independence of the respective clubs, they agreed not to transfer players ""permanently or on loan, either directly or indirectly from July 2024 to September 2025"". This means United will not be able to sign Frenchman Todibo, the £40m-rated defender Ratcliffe had hoped would switch clubs. However, City's pursuit of Brazilian winger Savio will be unaffected as he has returned to parent club Troyes, who are also part of the City Football Group, after his loan with Girona expired on 30 June. A CFG source told BBC Sport that City and Girona were compliant with all the CFCB requests. Ineos said in a statement: ""We are pleased with the positive decision from the First Chamber of the Uefa Club Financial Control Body which will see Manchester United play in the Europa League next season. The focus for Manchester United is on the season ahead and performance on the pitch."" City will be playing in their 14th consecutive Champions League campaign, but Girona qualified for the first time by finishing third in La Liga, their highest ever league position. Nice also seemed set to qualify for Europe's most prestigious club competition for a long time last season, but eventually finished fifth in Ligue 1. Manchester United qualified for the Europa League by beating Premier League champions City in the FA Cup final. It remains to be seen how the matter is dealt with over the longer term, given the shares are due to be transferred back in July 2025. At that point, CFCB say the clubs will be considered to be ""under the control or decisive influence of their investor"".

105,'Like a Euros final' -  'insatiable' Spain a 'winning horse',"This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 Germany Spain hero Mikel Merino says their Euro 2024 quarter-final win over hosts Germany could have been a final - and coach Luis de la Fuente compared his team to a ""winning horse"". La Roja edged the battle of the two top-scoring teams and arguably the most impressive in the European Championship so far. Dani Olmo, who played 112 minutes despite starting on the bench, opened the scoring and set up fellow substitute Merino's extra-time winner - with Florian Wirtz levelling for Germany in the 89th minute. Spain will play France in the semi-finals on Tuesday. Real Sociedad midfielder Merino said: ""I'm exhausted. The adrenaline is taking its toll on me now. It's been a unique moment. ""The match we were all waiting for, between two of the best teams in the world. It could be a World Cup final or a European Championship final.  ""We have shown that we know how to suffer, that we have a great team."" Spain score 119th-minute winner to beat hosts Germany and reach semi-final 'A flip of a coin' - tearful Germany suffer 'bitter' exit Spain have been one of the most impressive teams in the Euros, beating 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia and European champions Italy - plus Albania - in the group stage and Georgia in the last 16. Their young wingers Lamine Yamal, who is just 16, and Nico Williams, 21, have been two of the stars of the tournament. But they had to win this one in a different way, with the pair - and striker Alvaro Morata - all replaced at 1-0. De la Fuente said: ""I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable. ""They're used to competing at the highest level and they have an opportunity to win the tournament. ""How far we will get, we will see, but we're absolutely convinced that we can get very far with this side. ""We are so happy, but our euphoria is totally under control. We know tomorrow is already another day."" Spain will be without suspended defenders Dani Carvajal and Robin le Normand for the semi-final - and midfielder Pedri is an injury doubt after going off in the eighth minute for Olmo. Fifteen players were shown cards in the game - the second highest in a European Championship game - with seven for Spain, including Le Normand and Carvajal, who was sent off for two bookings. ""I played in the 80s - if you want to watch a video of the 80s and see how football was played back then, you know I don't get scared. I have a friend who says, 'what do you want, to get kissed?"" De la Fuente said. ""This is football, I am not afraid of these things - the game is played to the limit, I am not complaining about the toughness of the opposing team, I rather appreciate what we as a team have done."" Olmo, who plays in Germany for RB Leipzig and was named man of the match, said: ""The heart is always more important than the legs.  ""Let's take it easy and calmly, because in four days we have the semi-finals. We are going to enjoy, celebrate, but calmly and calmly, because in a few days we have the semi-finals."" Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin, watching for BBC Radio 5 Live, said: ""You talk about tactics and systems but it became much more human than that.  ""It was about who was going to be least exhausted and who would switch off for that split second. And it turned out to be the Germans. ""Well done to Spain. They are not just a pretty team, they have grit as well. But they also have a lot of suspensions so will find it hard to get past whoever they play in the semi-final.""

112,Cyclist fined for kissing wife during Tour de France,"French cyclist Julien Bernard has given a light-hearted apology after being fined for kissing his wife during a Tour de France time trial.  The Lidl-Trek rider was made to pay 200 Swiss francs ($223; £174) by the International Cycling Union (UCI) for stopping briefly during stage seven of the race. The governing body said the fine was for ""unseemly or inappropriate behaviour during the race and damage to the image of the sport"".  Writing on social media, Bernard apologised to the UCI for ""having damaged the image of sport"" but said he was willing to pay the fine ""every day and relive this moment"".  Stage seven of the Tour de France is a short course of 23.3km (14.5 miles) and is one of two time trials in the race - where cyclists race against the clock for the best time. The climb takes place in the famous wine region of Burgundy. According to Cycling News, Bernard was just 30 minutes from where he lives when he was met by his supporters. As he reached the top of a climb, friends ran towards him holding signs and his wife stepped forward - at which point she gave him a quick kiss, holding their son who was dressed in a replica cycling kit.  A fine for the same amount and for breaking the same rule was given earlier in the race to Italian cyclist Davide Ballerini, after he stopped to watch Britain's Mark Cavendish sprint to a record-breaking 35th Tour de France stage victory.  In a television interview following the stage, Bernard said the encounter with his loved ones had been a unique moment in his career and he had pushed hard earlier in the stage so he would have enough time to do so.  ""It was really incredible. My wife has been organising this with some friends for a few weeks now and she did a really, really good job,"" he said.  ""On a time trial, you have time to enjoy yourself. It's these moments that keep me going and cycling.""",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9vwvy430o,"Michael Sheils McNamee,",2024-07-06 14:08:55,

111,French far right seeks vote win but deadlock looms,"France votes in one of its most significant elections in years on Sunday, with the far right hoping for a historic victory, but political stalemate the more likely result. This is the first time the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella has had a realistic chance of running the government and taking outright control of the National Assembly. But after the RN’s first-round victory in snap parliamentary elections last Sunday, hundreds of rival candidates dropped out to give others a better chance of defeating the far right. Voting begins in mainland France at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and the first exit polls will be released 12 hours later. Whatever the result, it is difficult to see President Emmanuel Macron coming out of this well. Four weeks ago, he said it was the responsible solution to call a snap vote in response to the RN’s victory in European elections, minutes after the party’s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella challenged him to do so. The two-round election came as a shock to a country gearing up for the start of the Paris Olympics on 26 July. Security was already tight and now 30,000 police have been deployed for a period of heightened political tension. There are fears of violence in Paris and other French cities, whatever the outcome of the vote, and a planned protest outside the National Assembly on Sunday evening has been banned. In Dreux, a historic old town on the road to Normandy, Sunday’s vote falls on the day the Olympic flame is passing through. “For us it’s a massive thing, bigger than the election,” says Pauline in the tourist office. The flame has been travelling around France for almost two months, and Dreux has planned a weekend of festivities to mark its arrival. “Macron should have waited until after the Olympics,” Dreux resident Antoine told the BBC. Veteran commentator Nicolas Baverez believes the president has not just blown up his term in office and opened the gates of power wide for the far right. “He’s compromised the running of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which could deliver a final blow to France’s credit and its image,” he wrote in Le Point on the eve of the vote. The constituency that includes Dreux is one of the races to watch in the second round of this election.  Candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already won their seats, by winning more than half the vote. But another 500 contests are being decided in run-offs, mostly involving either two or three candidates. Former conservative cabinet minister Olivier Marleix was beaten in the first round by far-right candidate Olivier Dubois. They both qualified for the run-off, along with a candidate from the left-wing New Popular Front, which is in second place nationally. But because Nadia Faveris was narrowly beaten into third by her conservative rival, she pulled out of the race “to block National Rally”. One voter, Morgan, was sceptical that anything would change in the town, whoever won. There have been 217 of these withdrawals across France, including 130 Popular Front candidates and 81 from the president’s Ensemble alliance. And that has dramatically changed the balance of this pivotal general election. Projections after Sunday’s first round gave the RN a fighting chance of securing an outright majority of 289 seats, but final opinion polls on Friday suggest that is now out of reach, with 205 to 210 seats as a potential maximum. The parties trying to block an RN victory range from the radical left, Communists and Greens to the Macron centrists and conservatives. They say they are defending the Fifth Republic from the extreme policies of the far right. National Rally has watered down many of its policies but still wants to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing. It aims to abolish the right of automatic citizenship to the children of immigrants who have spent five years aged 11 to 18 in France. It also wants to bar dual nationals from dozens of sensitive jobs. Opinion polls are not necessarily reliable. Each of the 500 races is a local contest and voters do not follow recommendations from political parties. If the RN managed upwards of 250 seats, it might seek out allies to form a minority government. President Macron's party had to make do with similar numbers until he became frustrated with his limited ability to pass reforms in parliament. That kind of RN government is unlikely, believes Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris. It would soon face a vote of no confidence, he believes, and under the constitution, France cannot have another general election for at least another year. Another potential scenario is a “grand coalition” that would involve most of the other parties, except for the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party, which the Macron alliance and conservatives reject as extremists. This idea has gained some momentum in recent days, but Greens leader Marine Tondelier has made clear “there’ll be no Macronist prime minister”, whatever happens. There is also talk of a technocrat government, similar to those that ran Italy during the eurozone debt crisis. But instead of choosing experts from outside politics, it might include politicians with proven expertise in particular fields. In any case, France is entering uncharted territory, says Jean-Yves Dormagen of the Cluster 17 institute. President Macron himself has said he is not about to resign and will continue to serve out his final three years in office. “We will have Macron as a lame duck president who created this mess without having to do so,” Prof Steinbach told the BBC. “And he’s losing legitimacy.” The immediate concern for France is to have some kind of government in place during the Olympic Games. Constitutional expert Benjamin Morel believes the president could form a national unity government until the end of the Paris Games. “That would give the parties time to to reach an agreement between now and the start of the school year and the next budget,” he told Le Figaro.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0ygnyxgnqo,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,
110,Biden interview fails to quell Democrat concerns over fitness,"President Joe Biden's Friday night TV interview does not seem to have quelled an uprising within his own party to end his re-election campaign after a halting debate performance against Donald Trump.  A fifth House Democrat,  Angie Craig of Minnesota, on Saturday joined colleagues in calling for the president to step aside, and reports suggest more could follow. In his rare prime-time ABC News interview, Mr Biden dismissed his debate performance as just a “bad episode” and said only the ""Lord Almighty"" could convince him to end his bid for re-election. Mr Biden, 81, is spending Saturday at his family home in Delaware before two public events on Sunday.  There is growing unease among Democrats, although no senior members of the party have called for him to quit. Some polls show Trump's lead over Mr Biden widening, and many are concerned about losing the presidency and House seats, along with the Senate majority, if he leads the ticket.  Ms Craig, who is running in a competitive district in Minnesota, said on Saturday that she did not believe Mr Biden could ""effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump"".  She said that while she respected his decades of service, ""there is simply too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency"". Minutes after the ABC interview, Texas congressman Lloyd Doggett, the first House Democrat to call for Mr Biden to drop out, said on CNN that the need ""is more urgent tonight than when I first called for it"".  He said the longer it took Mr Biden to make a decision to withdraw, the ""more difficult for a new person to come on board who can defeat Donald Trump"". Other House Democrats including congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts called on Mr Biden to withdraw on Friday.  They join Arizona's Raúl Grijalva's call on Wednesday.  In his interview, Mr Biden declined to take a cognitive test and make the results public to prove he was fit to serve another term. ""I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test - everything I do [is a test],"" he told George Stephanopoulos. This response did not resonate  with Democratic congresswoman Judy Chu of California, who told Politico that his answer was “unsettling and not particularly convincing"" and that she would ""be watching closely... especially in spontaneous situations"". During the 22-minute ABC interview, Mr Biden rejected suggestions allies may ask him to stand aside, saying ""it's not going to happen"".  Mr Stephanopoulos pressed the president on his capacity to serve another term. “I don’t think anybody’s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,"" Mr Biden said.  Mr Biden, who is due to speak at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked Vice-President Kamala Harris for her support during the ABC News interview.  Ms Harris has emerged as a top contender to replace him if he were to step down. In an interview on Saturday at the Essence black culture festival in New Orleans, the vice-president said that November's election was crucial to American democracy, but made no mention of Democratic disquiet about Mr Biden. Essence was the first of a number events in July that appear to target female black voters, a key constituency for Democrats in November.  However, questions around Mr Biden's candidacy and the potential for Ms Harris to take his place will be difficult to avoid. Ms Harris has spent the last week close to the president, flying from Los Angeles to attend the White House 4 July celebration, sitting in a meeting with governors and Mr Biden, and also being involved in his call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vice-presidents have the delicate balancing act of projecting unequivocal support for their bosses while also tacitly proving they are up for the main job. That has been more so for Ms Harris as questions swirl around Mr Biden's re-election bid. However, some Democrats acknowledge concerns about Ms Harris as a presidential candidate. She struggled to gain her footing early in her vice-presidency as she was given responsibility for issues including immigration, student debt and voting rights.  Low approval ratings have dogged her in office, although they have improved in recent months. She has since refocused her attention on issues such as abortion rights, which Democrats believe will be crucial in November.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8971wl12r8o,"Rachel Looker and Courtney Subramanian,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,
108,Air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16 people,"At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured in the attack on the building which was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Video from the scene shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded. The Israel Defence Force (IDF) said it struck several “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.  The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter. One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit. ""This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning,"" she said. A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. The BBC is unable to verify this claim. In a statement posted to X - formerly known as Twitter - the IDF confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken ""numerous steps"" to ""mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence"". Hamas militants were using the location as a ""hideout"" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said. ""Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,"" it added. Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.  Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel. The latest incidents come after hopes began to rise in recent days that a deal between Israel and Hamas was on the horizon, following months of false starts. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the June incident as ""horrific"" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was ""shocking"" but could not be confirmed. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng04kpv2do,"Rushdi Aboualouf and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-06 20:08:55,
107,"We have too many prisoners, says Britain's new PM","Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to reduce the number of people going to prison through renewed efforts to cut reoffending. In his first press conference as prime minister, Sir Keir said too many people found themselves back in jail ""relatively quickly"" after being sent there. He added that intervening to prevent young people committing knife crime would be an early priority for his new government. But he said there would be no ""overnight solution"" to prison overcrowding, adding: ""We’ve got too many prisoners, not enough prisons."" It comes after he appointed a businessman as his prisons minister who has previously said only a third of prisoners should be there. James Timpson, boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of recruiting ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that ""we're addicted to punishment”. Labour, which won a landslide general election victory on Thursday, has promised to review sentencing after regaining office for the first time since 2010. It has also inherited a ballooning crisis in Britain's jails, and has already committed to keeping the previous Conservative government's early release scheme in place to ease current levels of overcrowding.  Last week the Prison Governors’ Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days. Tory ex-justice secretary Alex Chalk first announced plans to release prisoners early in October 2023. Mr Chalk, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in the general election, told MPs at the time the ""prison population is greater than it has ever been"" and the UK ""must use prison better"". However, he added: ""We must do whatever it takes to always ensure there are always enough prison places to lock up the most dangerous offenders to keep the British public safe."" Details of Labour's review are yet to be unveiled, but Mr Timpson's appointment has offered an early signal that a change of approach may be on the cards in this area. Sir Keir has appointed him a member of the House of Lords, allowing him to take up a post as prisons minister at the Ministry of Justice. The businessman told a Channel 4 podcast in February that prison was a ""disaster"" for around a third of prisoners, and another third ""probably shouldn’t be there"". He said too many people being in prison for ""far too long"" was an example of ""evidence being ignored because there is this sentiment around punish and punish”. ""We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,"" he added. Asked about his comments at a Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir did not offer a view on whether he agreed with those estimates. But he added: ""We do need to be clear about the way in which we use prisons. “For so many people [who] come out of prison, they’re back in prison relatively quickly afterwards. “That is a massive problem that we have in this country, that we do need to break."" He said his party wanted to cut knife crime in particular, and cited his plan to set up a network of ""youth hubs"". Sir Keir, a former lawyer, added: “I’ve sat in the back of I don’t know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. “I’ve often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they’d had support”. Labour says it wants to create 20,000 prison places by enabling ministers to override local councils on planning decisions.  But it also plans to keep in place the scheme implemented by the last government under which some lower-level offenders can be released up to 70 days early. Sir Keir said Conservative ministers had created a ""mess"" by failing to build enough prisons and mismanaging the prisons budget. Defending his decision to keep the early-release scheme in place, he added: ""We don’t have the prisons we need, and I can’t build a prison within 24 hours."" The latest official figures, published on Friday, put the prison population of England and Wales at 87,453 out of a ""useable operational capacity"" of 88,864. The SNP-run Scottish government, responsible for prisons in Scotland, plans to release between 500 and 550 inmates in the coming months. It comes as Sir Keir convened the first Labour cabinet meeting in 14 years,  telling his top team he expects them to hold themselves and their departments to the ""highest standards of integrity and honesty"". A Downing Street readout from the meeting said the prime minister told ministers ""the whole country was looking to the government to deliver on their priorities"". Following the cabinet, Sir Keir was grilled by journalists at his first press conference as PM. Asked about tax hikes, Sir Keir said he would take ""tough decisions"" and face challenges with ""raw honesty"". The new Labour government faces tough choices on public finances, with forecasts suggesting major spending cuts. But Thursday's landslide victory in the General Election has given Labour ""a clear mandate to govern for all four corners of the United Kingdom,"" Sir Keir said as he set out plans to tour all four UK nations in the coming days. Saturday also saw the final result of the general election, with the Lib Dems winning the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 BST on Friday, but a recount meant the results were delayed until Saturday afternoon. Candidate Angus MacDonald gained a majority of 2,160 over the SNP's Drew Hendry. It means the Lib Dems have won 72 Westminster seats. Six of these are in Scotland, meaning the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish Conservatives as Scotland's third largest party in Westminster.  Across the UK, Labour won 412 seats while the Conservatives were on 121.  ",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16jpkzz9g3o,"Paul Seddon,",2024-07-06 19:08:55,
106,"Air strike leaves 100,000 without power in Ukraine","A Russian attack on a power facility in Ukraine has left 100,000 people without power in the north-western region of Sumy. Work is under way to restore power, National grid operator Ukrenergo said, following the strikes, which caused emergency shut-offs for consumers in the city and region of Sumy, which borders Russia. There were no reports of casualties or damage apart from the energy facility, Reuters reports. Russia continues to pummel energy facilities across Ukraine, often plunging the country into extended blackouts with people enduring sweltering summer conditions without running water, air conditioning, or life-saving medical equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says, losing all of its thermal power plants to enemy action and seeing all hydroelectric sites damaged by drones or missile strikes.  This is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption, and more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, according to the national grid operator. Poland has been diverting surplus electricity to Ukraine to help it cope with the Russian strikes, but Ukrenego has scheduled cut-offs of electricity throughout the day across the country as domestic generation and electricity imports could not cover the deficit. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo told the BBC she is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it is obvious why: all our life, all our civilisation, is built on electricity,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian air defences shot down 24 out of 27 Shahed kamikaze drones Russia launched on the night of 5-6 July, the Air Force Command has reported on Telegram.

109,Gaza hostage posters torn down outside US politician's office,"Vandals tore down posters of Israeli hostages hung on the wall outside the Capitol Hill office of a Democratic politician on 4 July, his office said on Friday. Congressman Brad Schneider called the the damage ""a vile act of hate"".  The posters included photos of more than 100 people, eight of them Americans, taken as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.  Capitol police said they were investigating. Mr Schneider, a pro-Israel Democrat from Illinois, posted a photo on Twitter/X showing the posters shredded and thrown across the hall.  ""This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day,"" he wrote.   ""Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.""  The incident comes less than a week after pro-Palestinian protesters held an overnight rally outside Mr  Schneider's Highland Park home in Illinois. Mr Schneider said masked demonstrators banged drums, blew horns and screamed antisemitic chants outside his home. Police dispersed a crowd of around 40 people after several complaints from neighbours. Mr Schneider said such actions ""play directly into the hands of Hamas terrorists enabling them to continue to hold hostage not only those they kidnapped from Israel, but all civilians in Gaza as well.""  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Over 100 were released during a November cease-fire.

120,"Rescue street dogs, or euthanise them? Turks split over its strays","Under the shade of a leafy green apricot tree on a scorching summer afternoon, Gokcen Yildiz scoops up a squirming ball of light-brown fur. It licks her all over the face and she breaks out in giggles.  But laughter gives way to a more serious tone as she points to the dog's back legs, which are missing paws. A sign, she says, of the abuse some of Turkey’s street dogs are subjected to. Ms Yildiz is a secondary school physics teacher by day, street-dog advocate by night. The canine she’s holding is one of 160 she’s collected on the property where she lives on the outskirts of Turkey’s capital city, Ankara. Her dogs are a small fraction of the estimated four million that make up the country’s street-dog population. It’s a problem that has fiercely divided public opinion: are stray dogs a neighbourhood fixture to be looked after and loved?  Or does the government need to take more drastic solutions, like those state media are reporting that it's considering - including euthanasia? On her 15,000 sq m property, Ms Yildiz looks after elderly and disabled dogs, and those with psychological or behavioural issues. “It is not my job, but I look after dogs in need,” she said. “I always experience financial worry because the economy is getting harder. When the price of petrol increases, everything like pet food or the medicine I give, or the vet expenses - everything goes up.” She said she feels anxious about finances, but her bigger concern is what will happen to the dogs if she doesn’t collect them. “The dogs outside of here eat every two or three days, but they’re alive. They’re not about to die. That’s what really worries me,” she said. Lawmakers from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) are working on a new bill aimed at getting dogs off the streets. It hasn’t yet been introduced into the country’s parliament, but state media report it could require municipalities to collect stray dogs, shelter them for around 30 days, and if the animals are not adopted in that time, euthanise them. The latter provision has outraged animal rights activists - and Turkey’s dog lovers, like Ms Yildiz - but it’s also raised questions about whether existing facilities across the country could handle additional responsibilities. Only about one third of the nation’s provincial and district municipalities have shelters, according to Doctor Murat Arslan, president of the Turkish Veterinary Medical Association. He said this had been one of the problems with an existing law, which requires dogs to be sterilised and then returned to the streets where they lived. “In order to manage the animal population, street dogs needed to be collected, sterilised, given some vaccinations, and then released back to the street. However, not every municipality had shelters or facilities where these operations could be carried out. Especially in small municipalities, there are neither shelters nor sufficient employment of veterinarians.” If this law, enacted 20 years ago, had been enforced, the street-dog population wouldn’t be so large today, Dr Arslan said. Animal abandonment and overbreeding and selling of dogs had also allowed the street-dog population to rise, he told the BBC. Although animals are microchipped and registered in a centralised database, officials needed to be better at following through with fines for owners when animals were found to have been thrown out on the street, he added. Regardless of what led to the problem, campaign groups like Safe Streets Association argue a solution is needed to take dogs permanently off the street. Attorney Meltem Zorba is a volunteer for Safe Streets. She works with families that have been victims of stray-dog attacks, and points to government statistics that show over the past five years, street dogs have contributed to 55 deaths, more than 5,000 injuries, and 3,500 traffic accidents. “We have been pressuring for legal change for three years,” she said. “There should not be stray dogs on the streets. These attacks on people causing death, traffic accidents, and other animals being attacked are unacceptable.” She’s calling for a legal requirement to take dogs off the streets for good - rather than the catch-and-release protocol in place now. Ms Zorba also says the dogs pose other concerns including rabies and public health issues arising from dog faeces in public places, such as parks and playgrounds. “This is rationality,” she said of the creation of new legislation, adding that euthanasia should be a last resort and a result of an animal being deemed too sick or posing a risk to society. That’s where a national consensus seems to be building. A recent opinion poll showed nearly 80% of respondents supported measures to take dogs off the street and provide shelter. But less than 3% believed collected dogs should be euthanised. Both Ms Zorba and Ms Yildiz support a government solution that would allow dogs to be taken off the streets, collected in newly-built shelters around the country, sterilised, and looked after through the end of their lives, if not adopted. It’s believed that ministers plan to provide local authorities with fresh funds to implement any new law on stray dogs. But it’s unclear whether the government - already dealing with an economic crisis that’s seen inflation climb to 75% this year - has the resources available for such a solution.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnl020jvyppo,"Victoria Craig,",2024-07-06 00:08:56,
125,Celebrating 50 years of marriage in Nigeria’s 'divorce capital',"A couple who live in Nigeria’s “divorce capital” are being hailed for their long marriage having recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir spoke to the BBC about the secrets of their happiness, and about why so many marriages fail in the northern city of Kano, in a video that has generated much comment. Mr Yusuf puts it down to his wife’s generous nature. “She is a very unselfish person and she overlooks a lot which has contributed to the success of our marriage,” the 76-year-old told BBC Hausa. This prompts a smile from Ms Tahir, who is in her late sixties. Together the couple have had 13 children - and she praised her husband’s ability to remain calm in the face of the difficulties all families confront. “He is a very patient man and I feel that was also key to our success,” she said. The pair say they love and respect each other - and they clearly enjoy each other’s company, breaking off to laugh several times during the interview. For Hassana Mahmud, it is a revelation. The 39-year-old divorcee has been married five times and is impressed by the couple and their evident contentment. ""In all my marriages I have only spent four years with a spouse - so to see them on social media celebrating this milestone was refreshing,” she said.  “My husbands were all nice and caring during courtship but changed after the wedding,"" said the mother of four. “I feel bad whenever I hear people call Kano 'the divorce capital of Nigeria', I hope things will change,"" she added. Kano gained the epithet after divorce rates began to rise in the 1990s and it has not been able to shake off the unwanted label. Hundreds of marriages collapse each month in Nigeria’s most populous state, whose capital, Kano city, is the commercial hub of the north. In 2022 research done by the BBC in collaboration with the local government disclosed that 32% of marriages in Kano state only survive between three and six months. It also revealed that some people aged between 20 and 25 had already gone through three marriages. The scale of separations is a concern - especially for the Hisbah, a Kano state-funded Islamic agency that deals with moral issues and enforces Sharia, or Islamic law in the state. It has a police unit that enforces things like segregation in public places and an alcohol ban for Muslims, who make up the majority of residents. It also has a counselling service mainly to help struggling married couples. Long lines of women can often be seen queueing outside its offices to complain that their ex-husbands are not helping with maintenance for their children. People tend to marry young in Kano - often before the legal age of 18. Others feel Islam’s easy method of divorce might be a factor as husbands can simply tell their wives: “I divorce you” or write that on a piece of paper and it is over. Nowadays a message sent on social media is enough to end their marriage. Aminu Daurawa works for the Hisbah to address the high divorce rate. One of their solutions is to offer a second chance to people and better prepare them for married life. The agency organises mass marriages, known as “Auren Zawarawa”, mainly for divorcees - acting as a matchmaker on a giant scale. The hundreds of newly wed couples, who are treated to a big wedding ceremony, are also offered a small sum to help them set up a business and other household goods. This initiative began in 2012 - though Mr Daurawa acknowledges divorce rates are still high. “We know about that problem - that is why we set up a committee to check on each couple after the marriage so we don't get the former [same] results,” he said. But Hadiza Ado, founder of non-governmental organisation Women and Children Initiative, says the number of divorces continue to rise. “At the moment we get up to 30 marital cases daily in our various offices,” she told the BBC. “The troubling Nigerian economy is the number-one reason at the moment. “Husbands go out to make ends meet and sometimes come back home empty-handed, which causes rifts.” The practice of using matchmakers is common in Kano because in a Muslim society single people do not mix, so it is difficult to meet potential partners.  The only place that the sexes mix would be at university or other tertiary institutions, which most people do not attend. When people are matched together they often get married hardly knowing each other. In fact Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir were introduced as youngsters by an older woman in their neighbourhood. She was the one who felt they would be a good match - but they did not tie the knot for another 12 years, giving them ample time to get to know one another. One man with a reputation for making successful matches says that is key. “A lot of investigation needs to be done before marriage to know the persons involved,” Rabiu Ado told the BBC. He set up as a matchmaker 10 years ago. The 46-year-old had not intended to become a marriage broker, though it had been the job of his mother. He was working as a truck driver when he was approached by friends complaining about the difficulty of finding a partner. After making some successful introductions, he realised he had a knack for the family business. He now has billboards advertising his services - and gets between one and five clients each day. He interviews them and gets to know their attitudes and expectations. Often men want a woman who can make money and women want rich men. “A lot of people go into marriages with the wrong mindset, which is why they get disappointed after some time.” He says he has organised around 500 marriages over the last decade, with a success rate of more than 90%. He counsels couples to always take time to know each other well before marrying. Mr Ado, who has the nickname ""Mai Dalili"" meaning ""He who makes it happen"", says the high number of divorces means some people don't take marriage seriously. “I feel why divorce is high in Kano is because people feel I can always get another person after a divorce.” Islamic cleric Abdullahi Ishaq Garangamawa defends the ease with which Muslims can get a divorce. “Islam is merciful and made marriages and divorces not hard so that people will not be caged when things aren't going right,” he told the BBC. ""In the past we didn't have this many divorces as our parents were married for decades. It was in recent times that people started abusing the process for selfish interests,"" he says. ""But in essence, unlike in some religions where it's till death no matter the situation, Islam legalises divorce when things get out of hand."" Mr Yusuf, who used to work for the now-defunct Nigeria Airways, says sharing life’s difficulties and helping one another has been crucial to his enduring partnership with Ms Tahir. “Love is also key because when you love each other genuinely you tend to stay together. “My advice to people getting married is not to get into it for selfish reasons but go into it with genuine intentions.” His wife agrees, adding: “My own advice is that people wanting to get married have to be patient with each other - if one partner is angry, the other should be calm.” Additional reporting by Abba Awwalu Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

124,Junta chiefs 'turn their backs' on West Africa bloc,"Niger's military leader, speaking alongside the junta chiefs from Mali and Burkina Faso, has said they are ""irrevocably"" turning their backs on the wider West African bloc, Ecowas. The three men are meeting together for the first time to cement an alliance created in the face of opposition from neighbouring countries. Soldiers took power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in a series of coups from 2020 to 2023. All three countries – which now form the Alliance of Sahel States - have been affected by jihadist violence, in part a reason given for the army takeovers.  In January, they all announced a plan to leave Ecowas, which is holding its own summit on Sunday. Speaking at Saturday’s meeting in the Nigerien capital, Niamey, the country's leader, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, said that in the place of Ecowas, the junta chiefs wanted to build a community of sovereign peoples ""far from the control of foreign powers. A community of peace, solidarity, prosperity based on our African values.” Gen Tchiani is hosting the talks with Burkina Faso’s Capt Ibrahim Traoré and Mali’s Col Assimi Goïta. In a message on X, the Burkinabé leader said that ""together, we will consolidate the foundations of our true independence"". Speaking at the summit, Capt Traoré went on to say that ""this continent has suffered and continues to suffer from the fire of the imperialists. These imperialists have only one cliché in mind: 'Africa is the empire of slaves'."" Security co-operation is high on the agenda, but the alliance, known by its French acronym AES, will also look towards forming closer economic ties, including the aim of creating a common currency. This would be a rejection of the France-backed CFA Franc, which is used in many states across the region. All three countries have expelled French soldiers who were there as part of an anti-jihadist mission and turned towards Russia for military assistance. Calls for greater sovereignty and a rejection of the former colonial power have been a key part of the rhetoric coming from the junta leaders. The countries have also resisted calls from Ecowas for a rapid return to civilian rule. Capt Traoré arrived in Niamey a day ahead of the meeting and was welcomed with an enthusiastic reception. Television pictures show cheering crowds waving Nigerien and Burkinabé flags. Among them was Sidi Mohamed, the head of the National Youth Council. ""Today, as Africans, we are very proud to see a summit where it's an African summit, a summit where states have decided to pool their energies, to pool their forces to create an alliance for their development, without any foreign stakeholders, without any counterparts from the powers that are used to ruling over us,” he told journalists. Col Goïta arrived on Saturday. The presidents of the wider West African bloc will have their chance to respond at a heads of state meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on Sunday. They are also due to announce the activation of a standby force to fight regional insecurity. Over the past decade, the Sahel has become an increasing focus of Islamic State militant activity, creating insecurity and instability. The juntas in Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali have so far failed to quell the violence. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

123,Inside Keir Starmer's preparations for power,"“A face of thunder.” As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the State Opening of Parliament deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives’ plans laid out year after year. He carried the curse of the leader of the opposition – irrelevance. He formally became prime minister at lunchtime on Friday, but for a number of months now, he has also known that the British state has been quietly preparing for his arrival in Downing Street. “We have every hour of his first day, every day of his first week, every week of his first month, mapped out,"" is how one Whitehall source put it. What promise this victory holds is not going to fail because of a lack of homework or planning. Such is the level of preparation that the Treasury, in anticipation of the arrival of the first female chancellor, has apparently boxed in the urinal that has long been a feature of the chancellor’s private bathroom. Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!). Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.  Rachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir’s team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: “We have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.“ The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into “implementation plans"" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: “It’s ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget” without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys. Despite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir’s mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. “There are no secrets,” one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a “vote for a more radical, bold approach”. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change “proves” Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to No 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won’t be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through. And it’s likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government’s independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space. The Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair’s frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: “I so deeply regret that we didn’t hit the ground running on reform."" “Keir has taken this incredibly seriously,"" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet’s been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.  I’m told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: “They come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet – that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, ‘now, can I talk to you about the end of the world!’” Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he’s also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should ""Go quick! Go fast, before they find the loos!"" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don’t stay eager forever. Labour’s scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn’t make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away.  Whenever she’s been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the ""worst economic inheritance since the Second World War"" or as she said at her election count in Leeds ""there is not a huge amount of money"". Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters’ clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: “Things really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside."" Labour’s ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: “From today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.” A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories’ fault. What of the new PM himself? It’s not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it’s a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as “nauseating” pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase “moral socialism”. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a “force for good and a force for change“. That’s a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who’s been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. “He’ll be the most normal PM we’ve ever had,” says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. “He is theirs,” the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he’ll return politics to serve the people through what he terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw. It was Sir Keir’s belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer’s friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a “decade of renewal“. Just before polling day, one insider joked: “I’m never not thinking about winning the next election.” By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more “face of thunder” for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.

122,'We've learnt to do surgery without electricity': Ukraine's power cuts worsen,"Power supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son.  He was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication. ""We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,” Tetiana tells the BBC. Ukrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country. Persistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day. Tetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant.  She has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down. Power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too. ""Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,” she says. “My son can die if he doesn't get oxygen. I'm lost for words.” Recent blackouts have lasted as long as 12 hours a day in Tetiana's neighbourhood. For millions of Ukrainians, the absence of power can mean no running water, air conditioning, lifts or access to life-saving equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says. This is more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. It is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption – or Slovakia, Lavtia, Lithuania and Estonia combined, Ukrenergo says. ""All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. All hydropower plants in our country are damaged by Russian missiles or drones,"" Ukrenergo spokeswoman Maria Tsaturian tells the BBC. The lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems. To cope with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country, which last for many hours a day every day. As a result, millions of Ukrainians have become increasingly reliant on fuel-powered generators or big power banks. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been experiencing lengthy power cuts. Roksolana was elected by residents of her 24-storey apartment block to help run the building's facilities. She says living in tower blocks is not easy because power cuts also mean no running water on the upper floors. “The lifts are not working either, so mothers with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on when there is electricity,” she adds. “They've got to stay indoors for six hours on end, our elderly ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread."" Such residents in tall buildings are stuck inside their sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working.  They are also more exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go to the safety of the bomb shelters, which are typically located underground. In Zaporizhzhia, dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv says appointments have to be rescheduled at the last moment, and there've been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery. ""If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have started. There's no other way - we can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow,"" he says. ""Literally a couple of weeks ago power cuts became particularly frequent. Of course they're very disruptive."" To perform urgent or less complicated operations during blackouts, Mr Stefaniv uses a head torch. This is a skill he acquired and perfected while treating soldiers on the front line, and his firm still provides free or heavily discounted services for members of the Ukrainian army. ""I can treat toothache or swelling without electricity. We've learnt to perform surgery without electricity,"" he says. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it's obvious why: all our life, all our civilization, is built on electricity. You just have to destroy your enemy's power grid, and they will have no economy, and they will have no life,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom.""",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724532nqyno,"Vitaly Shevchenko,",2024-07-05 23:08:56,
121,'I'm worried' - Democrats at Biden rally open to change,"The hundreds of die-hard Democrats who turned out to see Joe Biden in Wisconsin on Friday didn’t need much convincing. The US president received an enthusiastic response to his loudly delivered remarks at the rally in Madison, especially when he attacked his Republican rival Donald Trump. But as some major Democratic donors and lawmakers call on Mr Biden to exit the presidential race, even some of his most ardent supporters here in Madison are keeping an open mind about whether he might be replaced - and what might come next. “It’s OK to change our minds,” said Catherine Emmanuelle, 44, who paused and considered her thoughts carefully before outlining her opinion.  She stressed that she was impressed with Mr Biden’s 17-minute speech, which she called a “presidential litmus test”. “But if something happens in three days or a week or three weeks, we shouldn’t be afraid of having a conversation about change,” she told BBC News. Mr Biden is under tremendous scrutiny after a disastrous debate performance last week, marked by a hoarse voice and several instances where he lost his train of thought. The president, 81, is facing a tide of doubts about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump, 78, in November's election.  Friday’s rally, held in this reliably Democratic town in a critical swing state, was an indication of the support Mr Biden still has in many parts of the country. But the raucous crowd, which waited through several opening speakers and a hour-long delay from the planned start time, was also shot through with low-grade anxiety. “I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump,” said Thomas Leffler, a 33-year-old health researcher.  ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said - a reference to the Democratic Party's signature colour.  Mr Leffler suggested that picking a new candidate might have unexpected benefits. “If you go through some sort of open process, you can re-energise people, and show that there’s a process better than what Republicans have, which is basically just to bow down to Donald Trump,” he said. Earlier this year, both the president and Trump secured the delegates needed to be their party's respective presumptive candidates. The Democrats' nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from 19-22 August. On Friday, Mr Biden was defiant about staying in the race, telling the crowd: ""I am running and going to win again.” Some of the biggest cheers on Friday came when the president directly went after his predecessor. “Trump is not just a convicted criminal,” he said. “He’s a one man crime wave.” The prospect of a second Trump administration was an animating factor for many who came to the rally. “During the debate, he told a bunch of lies,” said Greg Hovel, 67. “How is that any worse than what Biden did?” Mr Hovel said he believed the country was in a “great place” and that Mr Biden didn’t get enough credit for his economic and pandemic recovery policies. “At this point, in the next six weeks, the Democratic Party is going to have to make up its mind” whether to retain Mr Biden as their candidate or pick someone new, he said. But the president’s performance on Friday further bolstered something he strongly believed, even before the speech. “I think Biden can win,” he said.

119,Sacred buffalo calf offers hope amid efforts to revive species,"With cream-coloured fur and jet-black eyes, one of the smallest specimens of America’s largest native animal stumbled into the spotlight on shaky legs. Advocates hope the June birth of a white buffalo calf  - an exceedingly rare event - will translate into new momentum for a decades-long push to revive the species in America's Great Plains. Many tribes consider a white bison birth to be a sacred omen that signifies change. The herd this calf was born into has also become an important cultural symbol - it's the last wild buffalo herd in North America.  The herd is entering a new chapter of its life as stewardship of the species is increasingly being overseen by indigenous communities again and advocates push to grow bison populations. The American buffalo, also known as bison, once numbered in the tens of millions before being brought to the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Now, the only wild herd in the US is limited to just 5,000 animals.  But tribes and bison advocates see opportunity as Yellowstone, America’s first national park and the home of the white calf, considers a proposal to expand the wild herd’s size for the first time in decades.  The white calf has added spiritual significance to buffalo advocates' efforts as they test a long-standing status quo where government policies prioritise beef ranching over the beliefs of native tribes.  Just after noon on 4 June, Yellowstone photography guide Jordan Creech was sightseeing with clients when he spotted the freshly-born white buffalo calf, taking its first steps in the park’s Lamar Valley. Bison calves can walk within two minutes of being born, and run alongside their herd within the first seven minutes of life. “It’s the most unique experience I’ve ever had,” Creech says. Erin Braaten, a photographer of Native American descent from Kalispell, Montana, also witnessed the calf’s first moments of life before it disappeared into the herd. ""I thought I'd have a better chance of capturing Bigfoot than a white bison calf,"" she tells BBC News. For the last 2,000 years the people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakoda tribes have told the story of a woman who arrived during a time of need. A version speaks of two scouts searching for food and buffalo in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The mysterious woman appeared and offered their tribe a bundle of sacred gifts, including a pipe carved from red rock, and instructed the people on how to live and pray. She transformed several times before taking the form a white buffalo calf with a black nose, black eyes and black hooves. As she departed, a great number of buffalo returned to feed the people. Dozens of other tribes have white buffalo stories, interpreting its arrival as both a blessing and a warning. Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Tribe, is known as the Keeper of the Sacred Bundle — the bundle and pipe left by the spirit. He likens the white calf’s return to the second coming of Christ. Looking Horse, 70, said that before she departed, the woman told the people that she would return as a white buffalo calf “when everything is sickly and not good, and when people are with a not good mind”. “This is spirit. It means spirit is happening,” he added. On 26 June, more than 500 supporters formally celebrated the white calf at an event in West Yellowstone, just outside the park. Nearly a dozen tribes were represented.  Together, they heard the name bestowed upon the calf - Wakan Gli, meaning Sacred Returns or Comes Holy in the Lakota language. An altar of three buffalo skulls and three buffalo robes marked the occasion. Waemaetekosew Waupekenay, 38, who travelled from Wisconsin to attend on behalf of the Menominee Tribe, said the birth of the sacred calf has been a spiritual awakening. Its arrival, he says with amazement, shows that “there's a lot of healing, a lot of love going around. People are being united.” National Park rangers at Yellowstone have confirmed the white bison's birth, but rangers have not reported any sightings themselves. “The birth of a white bison calf in the wild is a landmark event in the ecocultural recovery of bison by the National Park Service,” the park said in a statement on 28 June confirming it as the first white bison ever seen inside Yellowstone. They added that it ""may reflect the presence of a natural genetic legacy that was preserved in Yellowstone’s bison, which has revealed itself because of the successful recovery of a wild bison population"". ""The National Park Services acknowledges the significance of a white bison calf for American Indians,” it added. The Yellowstone bison make up the only wild herd in the US and are among the last genetically pure bison in existence. But Yellowstone National Park regularly reaches the legally-permitted capacity of 5,000.  Tribes who support the species' growth have stepped in, believing the species' health is tied to their own history. Since 2019, the US National Park Service has transferred 414 healthy bison from Yellowstone to 26 tribes in 12 states through the Bison Conservation Transfer Program. Native people also have their own distribution system to share buffalo independent of the park's efforts. Since 1992, the Intertribal Buffalo Council -  a collective of 83 tribes working to “restore the cultural, spiritual and historic relationships” with the animals - has sent 25,000 bison to 65 herds on tribal lands in 22 states. “People don’t understand or realise that what happened to the buffalo similarly happened to native people, and that history is intertwined,” says Jason Baldes, who serves as vice-president of the council and is a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The returning of buffalo to tribal people marks a major change in federal policy for a country whose soldiers had once been ordered to kill them all to deprive tribes of food and supplies. And officials are not only returning animals, they're considering taking on more themselves: the National Park Service has just completed an environmental impact study at Yellowstone, and determined that the size of the herd should increase from 5,000 to 6,000 - but could accommodate as many as 10,000. It's the first time the park has proposed an increase in 24 years. The herd’s growth is made more striking by the fact that up to 60 million American buffalo were killed in the rush to claim ownership of the American frontier.  Unlike the native people - who are known to use nearly every part of the animal for food, shelter and more – the settlers killed them with reckless abandon, taking furs and leaving carcasses to rot. By the 20th Century, no more than 1,000 bison remained in the wild. Large-scale cattle operations took over the empty land and commercial interests continue to be a source of conflict between those who wish to see the wild buffalo roam as they once did, and the livestock industry. Ranchers and the state's Republican governor oppose the park service’s proposal to expand the herd, fearing a disease called brucellosis - which is carried by about 60% of Yellowstone bison - could infect beef herds and undercut profit margins.  The Montana Stockgrowers Association, which opposes the plan, has warned that the new policy could lead “to an exponential growth in bison numbers”. Elk are also known to transfer brucellosis to domestic livestock, but do not face the same restrictions as bison. Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a Montana-based non-profit which works to increase wild bison numbers, says the debate “is part of the old range wars of the West, competition for grass and which animals get to eat it”. Yellowstone officials previously conceded that the controversy over bison management is a complex challenge with several opposing interest groups. “It’s probably the single-most challenging wildlife issue in Yellowstone,” Cam Sholly, the park superintendent, told the New York Times last year. “The bison is the only species we constrain to a boundary.” But for tribes, the birth of the white calf is proof that more needs to done to support bison. The fact that the calf comes from Yellowstone has imparted it with extra spiritual significance. “The Yellowstone [herd] are the most purest, wildest buffalo – the only left in the country,” Chief Looking Horse says. “This is a message that Mother Earth is speaking through the animal nation.”",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5xjzqree2o,"Max Matza,",2024-07-06 03:08:56,
118,"Sam Carling: Meet the new youngest MP, born in 2002","A 22-year-old elected as an MP with a razor-thin majority has said he does not want his age to be the focus as he heads to Westminster. Labour’s Sam Carling is likely to be the ""baby of the House"" - the unofficial title given to the youngest member of the House of Commons - after narrowly winning North West Cambridgeshire. The Cambridge University science graduate student beat veteran Conservative MP Shailesh Vara by 39 votes to take the seat. Mr Carling called his victory a ""political earthquake"", and said he hoped more young people would stand for public office. ""Then they will see themselves represented, both in Parliament and local councils. It will help tackle apathy,"" he said. The previous ""baby of the House"" was Oxford University graduate and fellow Labour MP Keir Mather, who won the Selby and Ainsty by-election in 2023. Mr Carling, who has been a councillor in Cambridge, said many voters were surprised to discover he was running for office, but that ""people on the doorstep were very positive"". ""They said ‘That’s good, we need more young people’. ""There is a lot of abuse aimed at younger people online, but face-to-face, people are generally thrilled to find out."" However, he doesn't want his age to be a focus. ""I want us to get away from this strange mindset towards younger people’s age. As far as I’m concerned we’re just the same as anyone else. I just want to get on with the job."" He only recently became interested in politics, saying he saw a connection between social and economic decline and ""decisions made in Westminster"". Mr Carling grew up in a rural town in the north-east of England, which he described as ""a very deprived area"". ""I saw a lot of things getting worse around me. I was concerned about shops closing on local high streets that used to be a thriving hub and are basically now a wasteland.  ""And the sixth form closed, but I didn't make the connection to politics until later."" In his constituency, largely based in the city of Peterborough, he said the new Labour government had ""a whole host of issues to deal with – it's a microcosm of the country"". He wants his party to ""get to grips with"" a lack of dentists and NHS staff ""who are dreadfully overworked"", as well as ""fixing rural transport"". Mr Carling said it would be ""interesting to see"" what his generation makes of a new era of politics. ""I think a lot of people have only ever been conscious of a Conservative government. ""I would argue we can make significant changes and offer a better alternative, and hopefully engage more young people in politics,"" he added. Follow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

117,Murray's Wimbledon career over as Raducanu pulls out of doubles,"Andy Murray is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event Andy Murray's Wimbledon career is over after Emma Raducanu pulled out of their planned appearance in the mixed doubles. Former world number one Murray, 37, was due to play alongside his fellow Briton on Saturday evening at the All England Club. Raducanu, 21, said she has ""some stiffness"" in her right wrist. She moved into the fourth round of the women's singles with a dominant two-set win over Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari on Friday. ""I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles,"" she said. ""I’m disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but I've got to take care."" This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, was playing at SW19 for the last time before retiring later this year. The Scot is said to be ""disappointed"" that he is unable to play alongside 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, who missed Wimbledon last year after having surgery on both wrists. Murray's mother Judy, in response to a post on X from television presenter Marcus Buckland describing Raducanu's decision as ""astonishing"", wrote: ""Yes, astonishing."" Murray was not permitted to find a replacement partner for Raducanu under tournament rules because the draw had already been made. Murray and Raducanu, who were set to play China's Zhang Shuai and El Salvador's Marcelo Arevalo, have been replaced by an alternate pairing. It means Murray made his final appearance on Thursday when he lost alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation. Murray pulled out of the singles on Tuesday as he continues to recover from a back operation on 22 June. The three-time major champion is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event. 'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray 'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Wimbledon Saturday’s schedule played a major part in Emma Raducanu's decision. Being asked to play in the fourth match of the day on Court One is the same as being asked to play in a night session. And given this Grand Slam is a predominantly daytime event, you can understand why a player would not want to spend all evening on site with a fourth-round singles match the following day. The schedule put Raducanu in a very awkward position, and has led to a decision which will be very disappointing for Murray and everyone looking forward to what would have been a fun finale to his Wimbledon career. This was no ordinary mixed doubles pairing, although players do regularly prioritise singles over doubles. And there can be no change of partner once the draw is made. So instead of Murray teaming up with another British player, American alternates Rajeev Ram and Katie Volynets come into the draw.

116,Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian elected Iran's president,"Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian has been elected as Iran's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili.  The vote was declared in Dr Pezeshkian's favour after he secured 53.3% of the more than 30 million votes counted. Mr Jalili polled at 44.3%.  The run-off came after no candidate secured a majority in the first round of the election on 28 June, which saw a historically low voter turnout of 40%. The election was called after Iran’s previous president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May, in which seven others also died. The leaders of China, India and Russia have all congratulated Dr Pezeshkian on his victory. Even before the final results were declared by Iran's interior ministry, Dr Pezeshkian's supporters had taken to the streets in Tehran and a number of other cities to celebrate. Videos posted on social media showed mostly young people dancing and waving the signature green flag of his campaign, while passing cars sounded their horns.  Dr Pezeshkian, a 71-year-old heart surgeon and member of the Iranian parliament, is critical of Iran’s notorious morality police and caused a stir after promising “unity and cohesion”, as well as an end to Iran's “isolation” from the world.  He has also called for “constructive negotiations” with Western powers over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of Western sanctions. His rival, Saeed Jalili, favours the status quo. The former nuclear negotiator enjoys strong support amongst Iran’s most religious communities. Mr Jalili is known for his hardline anti-Western stance and opposition to restoring the nuclear deal, which he says crossed Iran’s “red lines"". Turnout in the latest round of voting was 50% - higher than the first round last week, when the turnout was the lowest since the Islamic revolution in 1979 amid widespread discontent, but still considerably low. Widespread discontent meant that millions of people boycotted the elections.  Lack of choice in the candidates, dominated by Islamic hard liners, and the impossibility of real change as long as the supreme leader tightly controls policies added to their frustration. Some people who did not vote in the first round were persuaded to cast their ballot for Dr Pezeshkian this time round to prevent Mr Jalili from becoming the president.  They feared that if he won, Iran would be heading for more confrontation with the outside world and that he would bring Iran more sanctions and further isolation. In order to stand, both candidates had to make it through a vetting process run by the Guardian Council, a body made up of 12 clerics and jurists that hold significant power in Iran.  That process saw 74 other candidates removed from the race, including several women. The Guardian Council has previously been criticised by human rights groups for disqualifying candidates who are not loyal enough to the regime. After years of civil unrest - culminating in anti-regime protests that shook the country in 2022-23 - many young and middle-class Iranians deeply mistrust the establishment and have previously refused to vote. On Iranian social media, the Persian hashtag ""traitorous minority"" went viral, urging people not to vote for either of the candidates and calling anyone who did a ""traitor"". But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected suggestions that the low turnout represents a rejection of his rule. ""There are reasons [behind the low turnout] and politicians and sociologists will examine them, but if anyone thinks that those who did not vote are against the establishment, they are plainly wrong,"" he said. In a rare move, he acknowledged that some Iranians do not accept the current regime. ""We listen to them and we know what they are saying and it is not like they are hidden and not seen,"" Mr Khamenei said.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx824yl3ln4o,"Kasra Naji,",2024-07-06 12:08:56,
115,Kimchi blamed for mass sickness in South Korea,"About 1,000 people in South Korea are suffering from food poisoning linked to kimchi contaminated with norovirus. Officials in Namwon City, in the south-west of the country, announced on Friday morning that there had been 996 confirmed cases - although local media reports say that number had climbed to 1,024 by early Saturday afternoon. Authorities said the popular fermented cabbage dish had been distributed to those now sick through school meals in the city. They added that students and staff from 24 schools were among the patients with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. Norovirus is very contagious and can be caught through touching contaminated surfaces - such as toilet flush handles - and from people who are already infected. Most people recover in a few days without needing hospital treatment, but some become very ill. Namwon City officials said it began an epidemiological investigation to uncover the source of the illness on Wednesday, after the first case was reported the previous day. Since then, the number of cases grew rapidly - rising from 153 on Wednesday to 745 on Thursday. In a social media post on Thursday, the city's Mayor, Choi Kyung-sik, said that health officials had adopted a ""pre-emptive and excessive response"" in an attempt to prevent further spread of the illness. ""We will ensure the safety of our citizens,"" he added. City officials said norovirus had been detected among patients, through environmental samples and in some of the kimchi regularly delivered to schools. As a result, its disaster and safety department had temporarily suspended the production and sale of any products from the company that made the kimchi - which is also in the process of voluntarily recalling products that have already been distributed.

114,What can we learn from Starmer's first day as PM?,"The last time I recall a cabinet meeting on a Saturday was during the Brexit years and the time before that was due to the Falklands War. In other words, they are rare. This one was about cracking on, and being seen to crack on, with the job of government with a momentum and energy. Standing in Downing Street and watching and talking to ministers – as we will get used to calling them – there was a first day at school vibe. Easy smiles, time to chat with the security staff, an excitement to clutch a red ministerial folder.  The novelty will no doubt wear off for them, and the slog of governing kick in. But this time, at least, there was a knowing awareness of the magnitude of this moment for them. It is 14 years since Labour ministers wandered around in Downing Street. And it is 27 years since they last kicked the Conservatives out of office. A couple of hours later Sir Keir Starmer looked comfortable, even relaxed, in the role of prime minister in his first news conference. Us reporters were led to the State Dining Room in the heart of No10, rather than the specially designed room in No9 built by the last government and associated in particular with rows about parties during the pandemic. These kinds of things do not happen by accident and who knows if this government will use the newer room on camera in future, but it was a visual marker of change. Sir Keir claimed to us that his government would confront the challenges it confronts with what he called a “raw honesty”. He and his ministers have already described prisons and the NHS in England as “broken”. How long there will be a patience with them blaming their predecessors, let’s see. What we will see next – and has been telegraphed in advance – is a blitz of activity and travel from the prime minister. It turns out that when you win a general election the meeting, greeting, dashing and smiling roadshow doesn’t end with a trip to the polling station. Sir Keir will travel to Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff in the next day or so and will meet England’s mayors on Tuesday. After that it will be a flight to Washington DC for the annual summit of the Nato defence alliance. A chance for the prime minister to meet fellow world leaders – and to be on a stage only presidents and prime ministers get an invite to. The week after (in other words, inside the next fortnight) there will be a King’s Speech – the State Opening of Parliament – where the government will set out its planned new laws. And then Keir Starmer will welcome around 50 fellow European leaders to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire the day after, for a meeting of what is known as the European Political Community, a new-ish body separate from the European Union. A whopping majority after offering “change” – coupled with a low turnout and a share of the vote lower than any other single-party post-war government – may afford this administration little time to demonstrate, if it can, that it is capable of delivery. There are determined not to waste any time.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728egw36gdo,"Chris Mason,",2024-07-06 20:08:56,
126,Mexico's coast battered by Hurricane Beryl,"Hurricane Beryl has lashed Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula after wreaking havoc across the Caribbean, causing at least 10 deaths.  It made landfall as a category-two hurricane early on Friday, bringing winds of up to 175km/h (108mph).  It was later downgraded to a tropical storm, but is expected to re-intensify over the Gulf the Mexico at the weekend. Beryl brought heavy rain to tourist hotspots of Cancún and Tulum. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages. Civil protection chief Laura Velazquez said power would be fully restored to those still without it by Sunday.  Tulum resident Carolina Vazquez was among those to be affected by the outages, speaking to the Reuters news agency as she queued at a soup kitchen organised by the Mexican army on Friday.  ""In my little house a tree fell down, half of the house cracked, the roof tiles,"" she said. Fernando Trevino, an employee at a local business, said: ""We are evaluating, but so far it seems that everything is in order with the protections that were put in place, the preparations and so."" Ahead of Beryl's arrival, Schools were closed, hotel windows boarded up, and emergency shelters were set up in areas facing the brunt of the impact.  More than 8,000 troops from the army, air force and national guard were deployed in the Yucatán Peninsula to provide support.  Hundreds of tourists were evacuated from hotels, and more than 3,000 fled from Holbox Island off the coast, according to local authorities. More than 300 flights were cancelled or delayed. On Thursday, many homes and businesses were badly damaged in the Cayman Islands, particularly along the coastline, where entire neighbourhoods were inundated. Hurricane Beryl battered Jamaica on Wednesday after causing huge devastation across other Caribbean nations.  Hurricanes frequently occur near the peninsula, with the official storm season running from June to late November.  The storm is projected to travel over the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas by the end of the weekend. By the time it makes landfall again on Sunday evening, the storm is expected to have strengthened back to a hurricane. Texas Governor Greg Abbott told people near the state's Gulf coast to ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"".

128,"We have too many prisoners, says new PM Starmer","Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to reduce the number of people going to prison through renewed efforts to cut reoffending. In his first press conference as prime minister, Sir Keir said too many people found themselves back in jail ""relatively quickly"" after being sent there. He added that intervening to prevent young people committing knife crime would be an early priority for his new government. But he said there would be no ""overnight solution"" to prison overcrowding, adding: ""We’ve got too many prisoners, not enough prisons."" It comes after he appointed a businessman as his prisons minister who has previously said only a third of prisoners should be there. James Timpson, boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of recruiting ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that ""we're addicted to punishment”. Labour, which won a landslide general election victory on Thursday, has promised to review sentencing after regaining office for the first time since 2010. It has also inherited a ballooning crisis in Britain's jails, and has already committed to keeping the previous Conservative government's early release scheme in place to ease current levels of overcrowding.  Last week the Prison Governors’ Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days. Tory ex-justice secretary Alex Chalk first announced plans to release prisoners early in October 2023. Mr Chalk, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in the general election, told MPs at the time the ""prison population is greater than it has ever been"" and the UK ""must use prison better"". However, he added: ""We must do whatever it takes to always ensure there are always enough prison places to lock up the most dangerous offenders to keep the British public safe."" Details of Labour's review are yet to be unveiled, but Mr Timpson's appointment has offered an early signal that a change of approach may be on the cards in this area. Sir Keir has appointed him a member of the House of Lords, allowing him to take up a post as prisons minister at the Ministry of Justice. The businessman told a Channel 4 podcast in February that prison was a ""disaster"" for around a third of prisoners, and another third ""probably shouldn’t be there"". He said too many people being in prison for ""far too long"" was an example of ""evidence being ignored because there is this sentiment around punish and punish”. ""We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,"" he added. Asked about his comments at a Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir did not offer a view on whether he agreed with those estimates. But he added: ""We do need to be clear about the way in which we use prisons. “For so many people [who] come out of prison, they’re back in prison relatively quickly afterwards. “That is a massive problem that we have in this country, that we do need to break."" He said his party wanted to cut knife crime in particular, and cited his plan to set up a network of ""youth hubs"". Sir Keir, a former lawyer, added: “I’ve sat in the back of I don’t know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. “I’ve often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they’d had support”. Labour says it wants to create 20,000 prison places by enabling ministers to override local councils on planning decisions.  But it also plans to keep in place the scheme implemented by the last government under which some lower-level offenders can be released up to 70 days early. Sir Keir said Conservative ministers had created a ""mess"" by failing to build enough prisons and mismanaging the prisons budget. Defending his decision to keep the early-release scheme in place, he added: ""We don’t have the prisons we need, and I can’t build a prison within 24 hours."" The latest official figures, published on Friday, put the prison population of England and Wales at 87,453 out of a ""useable operational capacity"" of 88,864. The SNP-run Scottish government, responsible for prisons in Scotland, plans to release between 500 and 550 inmates in the coming months. It comes as Sir Keir convened the first Labour cabinet meeting in 14 years,  telling his top team he expects them to hold themselves and their departments to the ""highest standards of integrity and honesty"". A Downing Street readout from the meeting said the prime minister told ministers ""the whole country was looking to the government to deliver on their priorities"". Following the cabinet, Sir Keir was grilled by journalists at his first press conference as PM. Asked about tax hikes, Sir Keir said he would take ""tough decisions"" and face challenges with ""raw honesty"". The new Labour government faces tough choices on public finances, with forecasts suggesting major spending cuts. But Thursday's landslide victory in the General Election has given Labour ""a clear mandate to govern for all four corners of the United Kingdom,"" Sir Keir said as he set out plans to tour all four UK nations in the coming days. Saturday also saw the final result of the general election, with the Lib Dems winning the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 BST on Friday, but a recount meant the results were delayed until Saturday afternoon. Candidate Angus MacDonald gained a majority of 2,160 over the SNP's Drew Hendry. It means the Lib Dems have won 72 Westminster seats. Six of these are in Scotland, meaning the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish Conservatives as Scotland's third largest party in Westminster.  Across the UK, Labour won 412 seats while the Conservatives were on 121.  ",2024-07-06 23:08:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16jpkzz9g3o,"Paul Seddon,",2024-07-06 19:08:57,

131,Djokovic bounces back to reach fourth round,"This video can not be played Djokovic beats Popyrin in four sets - Best shots Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic came from a set down to book his place in the Wimbledon fourth round with victory over Australia's Alexei Popyrin. After a slow start on Centre Court, Djokovic, who has 24 Grand Slam titles, won 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-3). He will play Holger Rune next after the Danish 15th seed mounted a comeback of his own, prevailing over Frenchman Quentin Halys in five sets having trailed by two. ""A very challenging match, I think mentally as well, to hang in there,"" said Djokovic.  ""I was not allowed to have too big concentration lapses. I think I've done well in that regard. That was one of the best tie-breaks I've played this year, that's for sure."" Popyrin, who had never been beyond the second round in four previous visits to Wimbledon, came out with intent and took the first set with a break of serve in game seven. But a lengthy break before the start of the second set as the roof was closed played into Djokovic's hands, as the Serb started to find his rhythm. The 37-year-old, still sporting a knee support on his right leg following surgery in June, broke Popyrin in the fourth game. There was a brief interruption to play late in the set when fans on Centre Court burst into celebration as England beat Switzerland on penalties to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2024. Fortunately, both players saw the funny side as Djokovic mimicked kicking a football and Popyrin raised his arms to imitate making a save. Djokovic went on to wrap up the set with his 1,000th ace in the men's singles at Wimbledon - just the sixth male player to achieve that feat. Momentum remained with Djokovic in the third, breaking Popyrin in the first game, and he dropped just three points on serve before another ace sealed the set. The fourth set proved a much tighter affair, with Djokovic missing three break points before a tie-break was required to settle the match. ""I didn't expect anything less than what we experienced on the court today from Alexei,"" Djokovic added. ""With that serve and powerful forehand, he's dangerous on any surface. ""I knew he was in form and he was going to come out believing he can win. He was the better player in the first set. I think I played a good second and third and the fourth was anybody's game. This video can not be played 'Couldn't do that again if he tried' - Ben Shelton hits incredible point Meanwhile Ben Shelton says he is ""100% ready to go the distance"" again after coming through a third successive five-set match to reach the Wimbledon fourth round. The American 14th seed defeated 2021 semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-2 on Court One. Up next for Shelton is world number one Jannik Sinner on Sunday. It will be a huge task for the 21-year-old, who has played on five of the six days in the Championships so far. However, Shelton said he is ""really excited"" about facing the Italian and ""always confident in my abilities, no matter who is on the other side of the net"". He has followed in the footsteps of his father and coach Bryan, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon 30 years ago. Resuming from Friday with Shelton leading 3-2 in the first set, both players held firm on their serve to set up a tie-break which the Canadian took. Mistakes from Shelton put him on the back foot but he used an excitable crowd to take the next two sets with some fantastic serving. However, Shapovalov fought back to force Shelton into another deciding set. Buoyed by the American support in the crowd, Shelton produced a host of brilliant forehand winners to book his place in the last 16 in three hours and five minutes. Eight-time men's champion Roger Federer was in attendance on Court One alongside parents Robert and Lynette Elsewhere, fifth seed Daniil Medvedev set up a meeting with 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov after beating German Jan-Lennard Struff 6-1 6-3 4-6 7-6 (7-3). Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard became the fifth lucky loser in the Open era to reach the fourth round with a 4-6 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 win over 87th-ranked Emil Ruusuvuori. Perricard's reward is a meeting with Italian 25th seed Lorenzo Musetti, who beat Argentina's Francisco Comesana 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, who defeated Britain's Cameron Norrie, will face Taylor Fritz in the fourth round after the American 13th seed won 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 7-5 against Chile's Alejandro Tabilo. Fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert defeated American Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (11-9) 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (8-6) and will play defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut beat Italy's Fabio Fognini in another five-setter, coming through 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 7-5 6-7 (1-7) 4-6. He will play American 12th seed Tommy Paul on Sunday. Meanwhile, Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur was handed a walkover when Frenchman Lucas Pouille withdrew with an abdominal injury before their third-round match. De Minaur will meet Arthur Fils in round four after the unseeded Frenchman beat Russia's Roman Safiullin 4-6 6-3 1-6 6-4 6-3. Norrie and Dart miss out on fourth round at Wimbledon Murray's Wimbledon career over as Raducanu pulls out of doubles",2024-07-06 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c1vd4272y04o,Charlotte Coates,2024-07-06 23:08:58,
130,'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters,"Emma Raducanu has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time since winning the 2021 US Open Emma Raducanu knows full well what it is like to be a little-known qualifier upsetting the odds at a Grand Slam tournament. On Sunday, the boot will be on the other foot at Wimbledon. The 21-year-old Briton famously won the US Open as a teenager qualifier three years ago, creating one of the most stunning shocks in sporting history. Now Raducanu faces New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun, a 23-year-old who had never played in the Wimbledon main draw until this year. The pair meet in the fourth round at around 17:00 BST on Centre Court. ""Qualifiers are dangerous,"" said Raducanu, who has not dropped a set in her opening three victories. ""She’s had three extra matches here at Wimbledon and she is not to be underestimated."" Sun, ranked 123rd in the world, created one of the shocks of the tournament by beating Chinese eighth seed Zheng Qinwen in her first-round match. She is the first woman representing New Zealand to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon in the Open era. ""The preparation doesn’t change I don’t think, you just take it opponent by opponent,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world after injury issues last year. ""I'm expecting her to be really dangerous and come out swinging so it's going to be a really tough match."" Raducanu missed last year's Wimbledon after having surgery on both of her wrists and has needed to be patient on her return to the WTA Tour this year. Difficult decisions have also needed to be made. On Saturday, she made the ""very difficult"" move to pull out of her mixed doubles partnership with Andy Murray - whose Wimbledon career is now over - because of stiffness in her wrist. Raducanu has been cautious in her scheduling this year and opted to miss the clay-court French Open in order to ensure she was in peak condition for the British grass-court season. The move has been fully justified. After encouraging runs in Nottingham and Eastbourne, Raducanu has played some of her best tennis this week since winning the US Open. ""Honestly, I'm just obsessed with tennis right now,"" said Raducanu. ""It's all I want to do and all I want to think about."" Raducanu needed to come through a first-set tie-break against Mexican lucky loser Renata Zarazua in round one, but has dropped just 11 games since after commanding wins over Belgium's Elise Mertens and Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari. The excitement among the British fans at the All England Club has been further fuelled by Raducanu's section of the draw opening up. If the former British number one beats Sun, another unseeded opponent - Spanish former world number two Paula Badosa or Croatia's Donna Vekic - waits in the quarter-finals. ""I just love playing on the big stages so much,"" said Raducanu. ""It's my favourite thing in the world, it’s the reason I play tennis, to play on these big courts and these big matches. ""It’s really special, you don’t get these opportunities often in life.  ""When I look back later in my career, when I get much older and have retired, I want to be able to tell myself I savoured every moment. ""So I play each point as if it’s my last."" Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz opens the day's play on Centre Court when he faces French 16th seed Ugo Humbert in the fourth round. After Raducanu's match, there is an all-American clash between second seed Coco Gauff and 19th seed Emma Navarro. On Court One, Italian seventh seed Jasmine Paolini - who reached the French Open final last month - takes on American 12th seed Madison Keys. One of that women's quartet is a potential semi-final opponent for Raducanu should she get that far. Italian men's world number one Jannik Sinner, who is aiming for his first Wimbledon title, plays big-serving Ben Shelton of the United States. That match is followed on the second show court by Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev taking on Bulgarian 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov.

129,'One of the world's best' - Saka's 'special' moment of redemption,"This video can not be played Watch all the penalties from England's dramatic quarter-final against Switzerland Bukayo Saka is Stuart Pearce for the TikTok generation. Young fans watching England reach a European Championship semi-final via a perfect penalty shootout might not know who Pearce is, but there were more than a few echoes of Euro 96 in Dusseldorf on Saturday night. England have only scored all their penalties in a major tournament shootout twice – against Spain at Wembley in 1996, and versus Switzerland in 2024. Against Spain, Pearce slammed home the third spot-kick and celebrated in trademark style with a fist pump and roar, the sinews in his neck straining to breaking point. Against Switzerland, Saka slotted home the third spot-kick and celebrated in trademark style with a wide and beaming smile, the image of the star boy so loved by the new generation of England supporters. For both men, shootout success brought redemption. Pearce scored his penalty six years after missing in the 1990 World Cup semi-final defeat by West Germany. Saka scored his penalty three years after missing in a European Championship final defeat by Italy. When Trent Alexander-Arnold scored the winning kick, Saka did not rush to celebrate with the bulk of team-mates, but sank to his knees with arms aloft in thanks. This was redemption, Saka-style - done with class, abundant skill and with irresistible likeability. ""I think for me, it's something I embrace,"" Saka said of exorcising the demons of Euro 2020. ""You can fail once but you have a choice whether you put yourself in that position again and I'm a guy who is going to put myself in that position. ""I believed in myself and when the ball hit the net I was a very happy man."" ‘Arrogance and confidence’ – breaking down England’s perfect penalties Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast This video can not be played Watch: Saka equalises for England The demons of Euro 2020 had been racist, disgusting and vile. Saka, along with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, was subjected to the most horrendous abuse after missing in the shootout against the Italians. Saka, just 19 at the time, took the fifth kick for England and saw Gianluigi Donnarumma save his effort. He was left in tears on the pitch. Three years later, and the circumstances could not be more contrasting.  Saka - no longer a teenage squad player, but key to England’s hopes - had dragged his team back into the game with a brilliant strike from 18 yards, just five minutes after Breel Embolo put Switzerland ahead. And, at the end, after the penalty shootout, he was smiling and celebrating with his team-mates on the pitch amid joyous scenes. ""In that shootout, the smile on Saka's face was brilliant,"" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told BBC Radio 5 Live. “You can't help but be reminded of the [Euro] 2020 final and it was great to see him put it away.” Southgate, who held the sobbing Saka tight on the sodden Wembley pitch in 2021, went through his own shootout pain as a player. His was the one kick saved in the Euro 1996 semi-final as Germany edged past England. ""It was so brave from Bukayo - he is one of our best and we were never in question he would take one,"" Southgate said. ""But we all knew what he went through. “I love them all but I had to give him an extra-big hug. I know myself these experience shape you. He has come back stronger, still resilient and loved. Tonight his tournament ignited a little bit."" It was not just the cool head in the shootout, of course. Saka was the most vibrant attacking outlet for England throughout the match, the high point being his brilliantly taken goal just as it looked like the Three Lions were down and out. Swiss defender Michel Aebischer will never want to face Saka again. The England winger successfully dribbled past him four times in the first half, more than one player had beaten another in any Euro 2024 match until that point. Euro 2024: England into semi-final after penalty shootout win against Switzerland - report and reaction 'If I can't enjoy this then it's a waste of time' Fans and pundits react to England win Bukayo Saka's penalty carried shades of the redemption Stuart Pearce found for England at Euro 96 ""He is arguably the most important England player because he does something different. He beats players,"" former England defender Rio Ferdinand told BBC One. ""He is like Arjen Robben. You know he is coming inside but you can't stop him because he is so sharp. He is the one of best wingers in the world. ""Saka has come to England’s rescue again,"" added ex-England captain Alan Shearer. ""Big players step up in big moments."" Saka's stellar showing becomes even more impressive in the context of where he played. Southgate changed formation to a 3-4-2-1, with the Arsenal winger redeployed into a very unfamiliar role at right wing-back. Saka, who was unhappy to be played as an emergency left-back against Slovakia in the last 16, took to this role with gusto. He provided England with threat and sparkle out wide, beating his markers inside and out - a quality the Three Lions have lacked throughout a Euros campaign that could charitably be described as stodgy at times. ""Unbelievable to play a new position compared to what he's used to,"" England captain Harry Kane told BBC One when asked about Saka. ""He has been eager to help the team and to play the way he did for 120-minutes - at the end he was knackered."" Tired but beaming, Saka said this was ""up there"" with the best experiences of his England career. ""Last time we took a penalty shootout at the Euros, we know what happened,"" he told BBC One. ""I believed. I felt like we dominated the whole game and the chance would come and I took it - I am proud of myself for that."" Like Pearce, Saka has found England redemption in a Euros penalty shootout. But for the fans young and old who idolise him, who know what he had to go through three years ago, there is something extra sweet in the story of this remarkable young man.",2024-07-06 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c25ljqrq2w1o,Emma Smith,2024-07-06 22:08:58,
140,Full report: French left celebrates as far right faces shock defeat,"France's far-right National Rally was widely expected to win this snap election, but projections say they have been beaten into third place. A left-wing alliance called New Popular Front are on course for victory, after a highly charged and abbreviated election called only four weeks ago by a weakened President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally (RN) won the first round of this election, and all the opinion polls since then predicted victory in the run-off round.  Instead, France is heading for a hung parliament with no party having anything like a majority. RN leader Jordan Bardella blamed ""unnatural political alliances"" for stopping their rise to power.  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who was appointed by President Macron only seven months ago, said he would hand in his resignation in the morning, although he pointed out that his Ensemble alliance were on course to win three times the number of seats that had been forecast. That was in part because 217 candidates, mainly from the left alliance and the Macron camp, had dropped out of the race to help their political rivals defeat RN.  Plenty of people were unhappy about it, but it meant that voters who had backed the centre or the left in the first round then pivoted to a rival party a week later, with the single aim of keeping the far right from taking control of parliament. Mr Bardella complained that millions of French voters had been deprived of a response to France's cost of living crisis by what he condemned as ""alliances of dishonour"". ""We don't want power for power's sake, but to hand it to the French people"" Mr Bardella told his supporters.  Party colleague Sébastien Chenu accused the Macron alliance of enabling a left-wing victory, leaving France in a ""quagmire"" conjured up by the president. That alliance has now left France heading for a hung parliament, but also in uncharted territory because the biggest group in the left-wing alliance is led by the radical and abrasive Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose France Unbowed is widely seen as far left by his rivals. A projection for TF1 TV gave France Unbowed (LFI) up to 94 seats, by far the most in his alliance. He was quick to seize the moment, telling his supporters: ""The president's defeat is clear; the president must accept his defeat, the prime minister must go."" A little more than an hour later Mr Attal - unlike President Macron, a highly popular politician - said he would do just that.  In an address from his residence at Hôtel Matignon, he said French voters had rejected the prospect of an extreme government. He praised all the candidates who had withdrawn from the race to stop RN from winning. ""Tomorrow morning I will hand in my resignation,"" he said. ""A new era starts tonight.""  Turning to the millions of voters who backed the far right he added: ""I respect every one of you, because there are no categories of French people who vote right and those of vote wrong."" His fate is now in the president's hands as France needs a stable government during the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July. Mr Attal said he was ready to remain in post ""for as long as duty demands"". But there are few people in the New Popular Front who are happy for him to stay in office. ""The president has the power and the duty to call us, the New Popular Front to govern. We are ready,"" Mr Mélenchon declared. Hastily cobbled together when Mr Macron stunned France with this two-round vote, the alliance includes Greens, Communists and Socialists as well as France Unbowed. Greens leader Marine Tondelier agreed the Popular Front was now ready to govern France: ""We've won and now we're going to govern France."" But she said now was not the time to push for a new prime minister. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ""France has said no to the far right coming to power. The far right made the choice of dividing the French people."" One of France's best-regarded politicians, former Macron prime minister Edouard Philippe, said the election campaign had led to great uncertainty in France.  While a ""crushing majority"" of the French people had said no to RN, they had also not given the left a majority to govern. It was now, he said, up to centrist political forces to seek a deal that would re-establish stability in France after weeks of tensions.

139,What is the New Popular Front and who will be PM of a divided assembly?,"The New Popular Front is an alliance of Socialists, Ecologists, Communists and France Unbowed (LFI) formed after President Macron called a snap parliamentary election on 9 June. These parties have previously criticised one another and have some key differences in their ideology and approach. But they decided to form a bloc to keep the far right out of government. The NPF has promised to scrap the pension and immigration reforms passed by the current government, to set up a rescue agency for undocumented migrants and to facilitate visa applications. It also wants to put caps on basic goods to combat the cost of living crisis and raise the minimum wage. There was rejoicing at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) in the left-wing camp when the projections were published. Against every expectation the National Rally had fallen from a clear first place in round one a week ago, to third place in round two. It now looks set to secure - at most - 150 seats in the assembly, some way behind the New Popular Front on the left and supporters of President Macron in the centre. It seems the calls from all the other parties to block the far-right’s coming to government have worked very effectively: Jordan Bardella will not be the next French prime minister. Who will be is another matter. The fact is that none of the three big blocs has an outright majority in the Assembly. What beckons therefore is a period of haggling over an eventual coalition forming around a programme still undefined. The left – flush from their strong performance – will expect a very strong voice. LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has said Prime Minister Gabriel Attal should resign and stated the NPF is ready to govern France.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd910je22no,Unknown,2024-07-07 19:10:24,
138,Democrats weigh risks and rewards of losing Biden,"President Joe Biden sought to revive his beleaguered re-election effort on Sunday, as members of his party debated the future of his candidacy. The president's halting debate performance last week raised serious questions about his physical and mental capacity to run. A prime time interview with ABC on Friday fuelled further speculation about his campaign's future.  Amid the uncertainty, Mr Biden appeared at two campaign events in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, on Sunday. But those efforts have not stopped the president's fellow Democrats from weighing the risks and rewards of keeping Mr Biden, 81, at the top of the ticket. On Sunday afternoon, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries convened a meeting with ranking Democratic lawmakers that reportedly included discussion of Mr Biden's candidacy. Four of those on the call said they thought Biden should drop out, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. Sources said at least three others expressed concern about his chances in November. A number of top Democratic figures also voiced their stances in televised interviews over the weekend, aiming to address the question: is it riskier to stick with Mr Biden or to leave him behind? Some say the party could be headed to defeat against Donald Trump in November if Mr Biden stays on, but others say replacing him comes with many unknowns.  Amid the fallout of Mr Biden's disastrous debate performance, asking the president to step aside could bring some immediate relief. Some Democrats, including avowed supporters of the president, have said as much, suggesting that concerns about his age and mental acuity had grown difficult to overcome.  The debate ""rightfully raised questions among the American people about whether the president has the vigour to defeat Donald Trump"", said California Representative Adam Schiff on Sunday.  Mr Schiff stopped short of saying Biden should drop out in his interview with NBC News - a position taken publicly by five House Democrats so far.  Instead, Mr Schiff urged him to seek advice from people with “distance and objectivity” and make a decision about whether he believes he is the best candidate to run. ""Given Joe Biden's incredible record, given Donald Trump's terrible record, he [Biden] should be mopping the floor with Donald Trump,"" Mr Schiff said. ""It should not be even close and there's only one reason it is close, and that's the president's age.""  Mr Biden is 81, while Trump has just turned 78. The ages of both candidates have become an increasingly contentious point among voters. On the left, polls suggest some voters are losing faith in Mr Biden. In a Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, 86% of Democrats said they would support Mr Biden, down from 93% in February. A different candidate may also offer a clean slate in other areas, too. Before this wave of Democratic panic, Mr Biden drew criticism from voters on several policy fronts, including his handling of the US economy and the migrant crisis at the country's southern border.    The president faced a threat of defection from progressive voters who oppose his response to Israel's war in Gaza. Their resistance cost him more than 100,000 votes in Michigan - a crucial swing state - during its primary in February.  A Biden ticket ""is going to drag everybody else down"", said former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan on Sunday in an interview with Fox News. ""I think you're going to see a significant amount of pressure whether it's today or tomorrow, sometime this week, as members come back that this may be untenable for them.""  Any benefit to losing Mr Biden may be muted by the looming risks, according to some Democratic leaders.  If the president stood aside, most of what comes after remains unclear: who would replace Mr Biden, and how? And how would that candidate fare against Trump?  And in recent days, several Biden allies have stressed the pitfalls of charting a new course, arguing that Mr Biden has been a proven success.   ""Biden is old,"" said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, on CBS News on Sunday. ""He is not as articulate as he once was. I wish he could jump up the steps on Air Force One. He can't. What we have got to focus on is policy - whose policies have and will benefit the vast majority of the people in this country.""  California Governor Gavin Newsom, who spent the weekend stumping for the president, said the same at a rally in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on Saturday.  “It’s the hypothetical that gets in the way of progress in terms of promoting this candidacy,” Mr Newsom said. “It’s exactly where the other party wants us to be, is having this internal fight, and I think it’s extraordinarily unhelpful.” Mr Biden's public supporters say replacing him may become a direct benefit to Trump's Republicans, who can argue their opponents are engulfed in party chaos.  ""We've got to stop talking about this,"" Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said on CNN on Sunday. ""We've spent a whole week. Republicans are having a great time. I mean, we need to get back to talking about Donald Trump and his performance.""  Earlier this week, former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan put forward a potential replacement: Mr Biden's Vice-president Kamala Harris.  ""I strongly believe that our best path forward is Kamala Harris,"" he wrote in a op-ed for Newsweek. ""Those who say that a Harris candidacy is a greater risk than the Joe Biden we saw the other night and will continue to see are not living in reality."" Though she has demonstrated only loyal support to Mr Biden, the idea of Ms Harris, 59, stepping in for Mr Biden has gained traction in recent days.  In Adam Schiff's Sunday morning interview, the congressman said Ms Harris could win against Trump ""overwhelmingly"".  As vice-president, and a 2020 Democratic contender, supporters say she is already campaign-tested and familiar to the Democratic establishment and its fundraisers.  Ms Harris ""knows the job"", said former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile on ABC on Sunday. ""To ask the delegates elected to the convention who are Biden-Harris supporters to bypass Kamala Harris... it would be political malpractice.""  But what makes her attractive to supporters could also be a catch: age isn't voters' only complaint against Biden and the administration's baggage surrounding policy choices could extend to Ms Harris.

141,New foreign secretary wants to reset UK-EU ties,"David Lammy’s whirlwind first trip as foreign secretary, organised at very short notice, is not about instant results or even brave new horizons. It is all about perception - the appearance of a new, vigorous administration, determined to hit the ground running, brimming with goodwill towards some of the UK’s most important partners. After an evening spent with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock - the two found time to watch a few minutes of England’s European Championship quarter-final - Mr Lammy’s tour moved to the bucolic surroundings of the country estate of Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorsky. After a couple of hours of talks, it was back on the plane for a short flight north to one of Nato’s newest members, Sweden. Why Germany, Poland and Sweden? Partly because of Ukraine. Along with Britain, all three countries play important roles in sustaining Kyiv’s war effort. With the new Defence Secretary John Healey on the ground in Odesa, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s government is keen to stress that the UK’s commitment to Ukraine will remain rock solid. Following a meeting with President Zelensky and his counterpart Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, Mr Healey said the UK would provide more artillery guns, a quarter-of-a-million ammunition rounds and nearly 100 precision Brimstone missiles. ""There may have been a change in government, but the UK is united for Ukraine,"" he said, promising to ""reinvigorate"" support via increased military aid. He also pledged to fast-track the reinforcements to ensure they arrive with the next 100 days.  “We want to double down on our commitment to Ukraine,” Mr Lammy said, as dragonflies swooped over a tranquil lake and a pair of majestic eagles circled overhead. France, in the midst of its own election - one which seems destined to have far-reaching consequences - was not on the itinerary. Not this weekend. No stop in Brussels, either. Sir Keir has said the UK will not return to the EU “in my lifetime”. But Poland and Sweden are both key European partners and fellow Nato members - good places for the foreign secretary to start exploring the outlines of closer future relations. “I want to reset both our bilateral relationship and our relationship with the European Union,” Mr Lammy said, adding a reference to Labour’s still rather nebulous pledge to strike a new EU-UK security pact. Meanwhile, on a visit to Edinburgh on Sunday, the prime minister said work was already under way to improve the UK's relationship with the EU. He said his government ""can get a much better deal than the botched deal that Boris Johnson saddled the UK with"". Mr Lammy said that when European leaders gather at Blenheim Palace on 18 July for the next meeting of the European Political Community (established by Emmanuel Macron in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), “the new spirit of co-operation will be on show”. The trip comes just days before Sir Keir takes his own first steps on the international stage as prime minister, at the Nato summit in Washington DC. These are tricky times to be shoring up relationships, with France taking a lurch to the right and the US possibly on the verge of returning the unpredictable Donald Trump to office. Mr Lammy agreed this was a “tough geopolitical moment”, but said it was important not to confuse disagreements between mature democracies with the threats posed by authoritarian regimes. “I am concerned when I see Iranian drones turning up in Ukraine,” he said.  “I am concerned when I see shells from North Korea being used here on European soil.  ""And of course I'm concerned with the partnership that I see Russia brokering across those authoritarian states.” Other issues hang heavy over the new foreign secretary’s first trip, in particular the war in Gaza. In Germany on Saturday, Mr Lammy spoke to the need to strike a “more balanced approach to Israel-Gaza”. It is not clear exactly what he meant, but with ceasefire talks apparently poised to resume, finding a way to end the Gaza war and revive the Arab-Israeli peace process seems destined to consume a large amount of diplomatic time in the coming months. For his part, Mr Lammy’s famously anglophile host said the relatively new Polish government shared something in common with the incoming Starmer administration. Both, Mr Sikorski said, were “the product of the public being tired with enthusiasts on the nationalist side of politics” - a remark which perhaps only partially reflected the true nature of last week’s general election. Mr Sikorski said he looked forward to “a more pragmatic approach” from Britain to its relationship with Europe and said the two ministers had discussed “some creative ideas of how to further that”.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4wypn23wo,"Paul Adams,",2024-07-07 21:10:24,
136,Analysis: French people reject the far right  - again,"The French have said it again: they do not want the far right in power. They gave them a big win in the European elections; they gave them a big win in the first round of this parliamentary election. But when it came to a vote that really counted, just as in the presidentials, they drew back from the brink. This surprise upset which has reduced the National Rally (RN) to third place – with perhaps 150 seats compared with predictions a week ago of nearly 300 – is due entirely to voters turning out in large numbers to stop them. The RN will argue – with some justice – that this was only possible because the other parties came together to play the system. They note that the disparate parties of the left all suddenly forgot their differences to form a new anti-RN coalition;  and then that the Macronites and the left forgot their differences too. They note that nothing unites these politicians (from Edouard Philippe on the centre right to Philippe Poutou of the Trotskyist left) except their opposition to the RN.  And that this lack of agreement bodes ill for the future. Nonetheless, the fact remains. Most people do not want the far right – either because they oppose its ideas, or because they fear the unrest that would inevitably attend its coming to power. So if Jordan Bardella will not be the country’s next prime minister, who will be? That is the great unknown. And contrary to convention following previous French parliamentary elections, it may be weeks before we have an answer. Because something has happened these past tense weeks to change the very nature of the French political system.  As Alain Duhamel — veteran of every election since Charles de Gaulle – put it: “Today there is no longer any dominant party. Since Macron came to power seven years ago, we have been in a period of deconstruction of our political forces. “Perhaps now we are beginning a period of reconstruction.” What he means is that there is now a multitude of political forces: three major blocs (left, far-right and centre); plus the centre-right.  And within these there are competing tendencies and parties. With no party able to call the shots in the Assembly, a long period of haggling is now inevitable aimed at forming a new coalition from the centre-right through to the left. It is far from obvious how it will be formed – given the mutual loathing that the different potential components have expressed till now. But we can bet that President Macron will now call for a period of apaisement – conciliation – after the tensions of the last weeks. Conveniently this period will last through the Olympics and the summer holidays, allowing the French to recover their spirits. In the meantime, he will designate somebody to lead the talks and reach out to the different parties. Will it be someone from the left? Will it be someone from the centre?  Will it be a political outsider?  We do not know. What seems certain though is that France is about to enter a more parliamentary system.   Power will drain from President Macron, and towards whoever heads the new government. Even if he manages to place a centrist in the prime ministership (far from easy, given the strength of the left) that person will exercise power in his or her own right, and on the basis of parliamentary support.  Macron – with no prospect of running again in 2027 – will be a diminished figure. So has the president lost his bet?  Is he regretting his haste in calling the elections?  Is he ready to take a backward step? We can be sure that is not the way Macron sees it.  He will be saying that he called the vote because the situation was untenable; that he has clarified politics,  offered the RN a fairer share of Assembly seats, given their widespread support; and  that his gamble that the French would never put the far-right in power was correct. And in the meantime, he has not exactly gone away.  Macron’s power may be on the wane.  But he is still there at the Elysée, consulting with his team, prodding politicians,  still master of the political clock.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrlxn4ngdgo,"Hugh Schofield,",2024-07-07 21:10:24,
135,Projections show surprise lead for France's left alliance,"A woman holds up an anti-RN placard in Paris reading ""They shall not pass"" There's been a major surprise in France's parliamentary elections, with projections indicating the far-right National Rally (RN) has been beaten into third place because of a tactical pact between the left and the centre.  In the first round a week ago, the RN won the most votes but a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), now appears on course to take the most seats after the second round. President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance is projected to come second. No bloc will have a majority to govern on its own.  It's not clear who'll be the next prime minister but the incumbent from Macron's party, Gabriel Attal, has said he'll resign.  The informal pact saw many leftist or centrist candidates withdraw from run-offs to concentrate the vote against the far right. The hard-left leader of the France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, welcomed the NFP's apparent win as a triumph against the far right and a defeat of Macron's agenda. Mélenchon hailed  what he called a magnificent mobilisation effort. Supporters of the left are holding a victory rally at the Place de la Republique in central Paris.  RN leader Jordan Bardella said an ""alliance of dishonour"" had kept his party from power, throwing France into the arms of the extreme left. The party's former president, Marine Le Pen, said the projected result just delayed its victory. ",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ck7gydwgvy8t,Unknown,Unknown,
137,France's far right 'sad and disappointed' over election result,"The champagne was on ice, the jazz was on low: the scene was set at the pavilion in Paris’s Bois de Vincennes forest where the National Rally (RN) was staging what it hoped would be its victory rally.  Hundreds of journalists had come from across the world, the sniffer dogs in place to protect a party that was, we all thought, at the gates of power; the first time the far right would enter government in France since World War Two. But as time ticked towards the exit poll at 8pm, the mood began to turn. Party apparatchiks talked in hushed tones of indications they had fallen short. Nervous glances were exchanged, the glasses looked more half-empty than half-full. And then the screens told the story: of the National Rally beaten into third place by the left and by President Macron’s centrists. There was stunned silence – and then a smattering of applause by party supporters to try to keep spirits up. “We are sad, disappointed, struck down by this result,” said Rosa Gave, as she clutched a French flag.  “We are victims of a dishonest alliance led by Macron to block us from power.” That ""alliance"" was more of a pact, struck in the last week by opponents of the National Rally - that in many of the three-way races where the RN was in the lead, the third candidate would withdraw, urging voters to rally behind the figure best-placed to stop the far-right. And it worked. It’s a common electoral tactic here – but has still drawn the ire of the RN. As Jordan Bardella, the party’s 28-year-old president – and the man who had hoped to become France’s prime minister – arrived, there were cheers from the dwindling crowd inside.  “Depriving millions of French people of the possibility of seeing their ideas brought to power will never be a viable destiny for France”, he said.  He denounced President Emmanuel Macron for, in his words, pushing France towards instability – and into the arms of what he called the “extreme left”: a reference to France Unbowed, the party leading the victorious left-wing coalition. And then came Marine Le Pen, the National Rally’s leader, whose dream of national power has once again been thwarted at the eleventh hour. She was thronged by journalists, as her supporters chanted “Marine, Présidente!” A couple of reporters were pushed over in the melee.  “The tide is rising – our victory has only been delayed,” she said, calling President Macron’s position “untenable”.  The president who came to power promising to revive the centre ground, to bridge right and left, has done anything but – pushing the French to the extremes. And while many in the National Rally will feel bitterly disappointed that their victory in the first round of this election did not lead them to power after the second, they will be cheering a significant increase in the number of their MPs since the last parliamentary election, confident that one day their time will come. “France has chosen the coalition of the worst,” said Matteo Giammaresi, a National Rally supporter, holding his champagne glass on a rapidly emptying dancefloor.  “What we say now is giving France hope for the future.” The party will now wait this government out, believing that division and disunity will play into Marine Le Pen’s hands. And then, at the 2027 presidential election, she would be able to say - this is what happens when we are blocked from power. What government now emerges is still deeply unclear.  A hung parliament awaits – and potential paralysis. France has been plunged into the political unknown – just not in the way pollsters predicted.",2024-07-07 23:10:24,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyq3lzvg8o,"Mark Lowen,",2024-07-07 22:22:24,
142,Titanic and Avatar producer Jon Landau dies aged 63,"Jon Landau - the Oscar-winning producer of some of the world's highest-grossing movies of all time, including Titanic and Avatar - has died aged 63. Landau, who was the long-time producing partner of filmmaker James Cameron, reportedly died on Friday after living with cancer for more than a year. His sister Tina confirmed his death on social media, calling him ""the best brother a girl could ever dream of"". ""My heart is broken but also bursting with pride & gratitude for his most extraordinary life, and the love and gifts he gave me - and all who knew him or his films,"" she wrote.  Landau was the son of Hollywood producers Ely and Edie Landau and for a time was an executive at the film production company 20th Century Fox, overseeing films including The Last Of The Mohicans and Die Hard 2. Alongside Cameron, he helped to create the 1997 hit Titanic, which was the first film to make it past the $1bn mark at the global box office. Later films Avatar and its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water, which were released in 2009 and 2022 respectively, went on to break Titanic's record.  Landau also co-produced other hit films including Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Dick Tracy, and held a management position in Cameron's production company Lightstorm Entertainment.   Following news of Landau's death, Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter that ""a great producer and a great human being has left us"".  ""Jon Landau believed in the dream of cinema. He believed that film is the ultimate human art form, and to make films you have to first be human yourself,"" he said.  ""He will be remembered as much for his vast generosity of spirit as for the movies themselves.” Director Sir Peter Jackson and his screenwriter wife Fran Walsh, whose visual effects company was used for the Avatar films, said in a statement that they were ""devastated by the loss of Jon Landau"". ""Jon brought unparalleled passion to the projects he worked on and his influence will continue to inspire for years to come."" The actor Zoe Saldaña, who starred in the Avatar films, wrote a message to Landau on Instagram, saying that his death was ""hitting really hard"".

144,Senior Hamas official killed as Israel orders fresh evacuation,"A senior Hamas administration official was among four people killed in an Israeli air strike at a school in Gaza City, Palestinian sources say. A local official told the BBC that Ehab Al-Ghussein was appointed to manage the affairs of the Hamas government in Gaza City and northern Gaza three months ago. The Israeli army says that it carried out a strike on the area of a school building in Gaza City from which it says ""terrorists were operating and hiding"". It says that it took steps to minimise the risk of civilians being harmed. Eyewitnesses say the attack targeted the Holy Family School next to the Holy Family Church to the west of Gaza city. A large number of people were sheltering in the building, the BBC understands. The air strike targeted two classrooms on the ground floor, they said. Ehab Al-Ghussein was formerly deputy labour minister in the Hamas administration and before that an interior ministry spokesman. His death is not considered to be a blow to Hamas militarily, but he was considered a significant figure in the leadership of the Hamas administration. Many others in the Hamas administration have been killed in the past nine months. In one Israeli airstrike last November, the deputy culture minister and the deputy speaker of the legislative council were killed, along with other government employees and officials, as well as senior police officers. Separately the Israeli military issued another evacuation order for a central part of Gaza City. Ibrahim Al-Barbari, 47, who lives with his wife, five children, mother and sister in the Bani Amer neighbourhood, told the BBC that dozens of families were leaving and women and children were carrying bags and heading west. “We heard from the neighbours that we had to leave the house. We haven’t received any calls or texts from the army, but we have already started gathering our belongings in preparation for moving again.  ""We have been living in a state of near famine for months."" Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that any ceasefire deal in Gaza must allow Israel to resume fighting afterwards, until its objectives are met.  He has previously defined these as dismantling Hamas's military and governing capabilities, as well as returning hostages.  Hamas officials say they are awaiting Israel's response to the latest ceasefire proposals. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-07 23:10:25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce93qvvzzx0o,"Sebastian Usher and Rushdi Abualouf,",2024-07-07 20:10:25,
145,Are deep shifts in UK Muslim and Jewish voting here to stay?,"However big the headline change in the vote between the past two elections, drill down into two demographic pockets of Britain and you find staggering shifts. It all centres around the relationships between the Labour Party and not just Muslim voters, but Jewish voters too. It leaves a party in government that has made progress in winning back trust among people from one faith group while suddenly finding itself with a lot of work to do to win back many members of the other. The drop in the Labour vote share among British Muslims between 2019 and 2024 very obviously played out in several constituencies. This happened most dramatically in Leicester South, with a Muslim population close to 30%, where Shadow Paymaster General Jon Ashworth lost his seat to independent Shockat Adam. In the seat of Dewsbury and Batley, in Birmingham Perry Barr and in Blackburn, there were wins for independents in what had been safe Labour seats with large numbers of Muslim voters. In places like Bradford West and the seat of Bethnal Green and Stepney in east London, sitting Labour MPs clung on with startling reductions in their majorities. Mish Rahman, from Walsall, is not just any Muslim voter. He currently sits on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, a body of fewer than 40 members. He is furious with the party’s response to the killing of tens of thousands of people in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there. “In my community it has got to the point where I am now embarrassed about my affiliation with Labour,” he says. “It was hard even to tell members of my own extended family to go and knock on doors to tell people to vote for a party that originally gave Israel carte blanche in its response to the horrific 7 October attacks,” says Mr Rahman. He lays the blame for the decline in Muslim voting for Labour squarely at the door of the Labour leader. Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by many in his party, including councillors, for an interview with LBC in October in which he suggested that Israel “had the right” to withhold power and water in Gaza. His spokesman subsequently suggested the Labour leader had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. Then when Labour MPs were told by the party leadership in November to abstain from voting on an SNP-led motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, some Labour councillors resigned and, for many Muslims, trust in their Labour MP was lost. Faith communities are far from homogenous, of course. There are myriad factors that govern how a person will cast their vote, but faith does throw up a unique set of considerations that plays out in broad voting patterns. Muslims are estimated to form around 6.5% of the population of England and Wales, with around 2% in Scotland and 1% in Northern Ireland. Well over 80% of Muslims are believed to have voted for Labour in 2019. Research just ahead of the 2024 election suggested that had dropped nationally by up to 20 percentage points, and in some constituencies the Muslim vote for Labour clearly fell further. The contrast with Jewish voting data could not be more stark. In 2019, the proportion of British Jews (about 0.5% of the population) who voted for a Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is thought to have collapsed to just single figures. Research suggests that figure could have climbed back to above 40%. “What we have seen is a huge bounce-back for Labour among Jewish voters,” says Adam Langleben, who was until recently the national secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement. Mr Langleben, a former Labour councillor and now director of Progressive Britain (formerly Progress), points to Labour wins in London in the Finchley and Golders Green seat and also Hendon as well as Bury South in Greater Manchester, all constituencies with large Jewish populations. “Jewish voters returning to the party has undoubtedly delivered seats to the Labour Party,” says Mr Langleben. “You don’t need a majority of Jewish voters to win in these constituencies, but you also can’t only have 7% of them voting for you and expect to win,” he says. Mr Langleben had been a senior member of the Jewish Labour Movement but was one of many Jewish members of the party to give up their membership during the Corbyn era. When he left in 2019, he said it was on account of the party being “led by antisemites”, an accusation always strongly denied by those leading the party at the time. “It was a situation that was all-consuming. I would be canvassing for the Labour Party in a Jewish area and had people in tears on the doorstep saying there was no way they could vote for Jeremy Corbyn, and I was trying to juggle this huge personal tension,” he says. Mr Langleben puts Mr Corbyn’s problems down to both a lack of personal reflection about who he was associating with, and what he says was the party’s inability to deal with extreme elements in its base and tolerance of the use of antisemitic tropes. “From day one, Keir Starmer pledged to work with the Jewish community to try to deal with the issues inside the Labour Party. For him, fixing what went wrong was a personal mission,” he says. But given that Keir Starmer supported Jeremy Corbyn throughout his leadership, Jewish voters at hustings in synagogues and community centres around the country had been grilling Labour candidates as to why they should trust the current leader now. “The Jewish vote is now split and that’s how it should be. The results show there wasn’t a dominant party of choice, and that’s healthy, and still represents a huge transformation for Labour,” says Mr Langleben. So while mistrust clearly still remains, what is responsible for the transformation in the perception of the Labour Party among some British Jews? The fact that the current leadership’s criticism of Israel’s response to the 7 October attacks has been more tempered than it may have been under the previous leadership may have contributed. But long before that, Mr Langleben cites a change in the way complaints around “protected characteristics” like faith are dealt with by the party, but also refers to one thing that convinced him he was right to re-join the party. “The fundamental moment was Jeremy Corbyn being suspended from the Labour Party and then subsequently having the whip removed, because it showed Keir Starmer’s determination and his willingness to take on parts of the party that previously he had not been willing to take on,” he says. Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension is precisely identified by Mr Rahman too as the first major showdown between different wings of the party under Keir Starmer. Except, as someone who had been inspired by Mr Corbyn from the days of Stop the War protests in the lead-up to the UK-backed invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr Rahman was on the other side, saying that was the moment when the alarm bells started ringing for him that the party leaders were not safeguarding the values he believed in. Mr Rahman does not see the party’s anti-Muslim slant as being limited to its response to events in Gaza. He does not question there have been serious cases of antisemitism but does not believe all accusations of racism are treated equally. “There is a clear hierarchy of racism in the Labour Party. Some instances of racism, including Islamophobia, aren't taken as seriously as they should,” he says. Mr Rahman cites the case of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the EHRC, who was suspended for alleged Islamophobia. Mr Phillips had said British Muslims were “a nation within a nation” and previously that their opinion was “some distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else’s”, though later he suggested this had not necessarily been meant as a criticism. Mr Phillips was readmitted to the party in 2021 without it going to a panel inquiry. Mr Rahman, like many other Muslims, also points to Keir Starmer’s own comments, like those made in a Sun livestream during the election campaign, when he talked of migrants being sent back to the countries they came from. “At the moment, people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed because they’re not being processed,” the Labour leader said. “Can you imagine the Labour Party saying that about people of any other ethnicity? Saying they're going to deport people to Israel or Ukraine or Hong Kong? It wouldn’t happen and neither should it,” says Mr Rahman. Such is his disenchantment with Labour’s response that, coupled with wider concerns regarding the treatment of Muslims, he lays a serious charge against the party. “I don’t doubt for a minute that Labour is currently institutionally Islamophobic,” says Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman wants to use his voice to call out hypocrisy in the party while in government, in the hope that it will learn what he says is a lesson of this election - that no voter can be taken for granted. Mr Rahman did give up his membership of the Labour Party once before, in protest at Tony Blair’s role in the Iraq War. He, and other Muslims, felt persuaded to come back to the party in 2014 when the then-leader Ed Miliband condemned the scale of an Israeli operation in Gaza and the hundreds of civilian deaths. Once again, at the same moment, Mr Langleben was seeing things very differently on the doorsteps of Jewish voters. Even though Mr Miliband was himself Jewish, it was a time when polls were showing a rapid decline in Jewish support for Labour, particularly when the party’s 2015 manifesto talked about a parliamentary vote to recognise a Palestinian state. “There were sometimes quite horrible conversations with Jewish voters who really cared about the issue of Israel,” says Mr Langleben. “People in 2015 were accusing the Labour Party of antisemitism, but I think it fundamentally misread what antisemitism is. Then, it was a primarily about a foreign policy issue, Israel. That changed by 2019 when conversations were around a particular strain of far-left anti-Jewish racism,” says Mr Langleben. For some of those supportive of the Corbyn-era leadership, that sense that criticism of Israel was being conflated with antisemitism was also something they felt occurred while he was leader. The Hamas attacks of the 7 October 2023 happened during the week of the Labour Party conference and Mr Langleben says it was strange to see normal political business go on while he and other Jewish delegates were going through a difficult and upsetting period. Ultimately, Mr Langleben says he has been pleased with the way Keir Starmer has handled the crisis, seeing it as Labour realigning itself with UK and US government policy on Israel. This is precisely why during this election campaign, Mr Rahman had the hardest conversations on the doorsteps of Muslim voters he had ever had, with anger and frustration boiling over about Israel’s actions in Gaza. “If you look back at the history of the relationship between our communities and the Labour Party, it's always been a one-sided affair of loyalty from our communities,” Mr Rahman says. The Labour Party’s roots in his own family go back to his grandfather, who was a factory worker in the 1950s and 60s. Mr Rahman talks of feeling “betrayed”. Gaza of course is not just a Muslim issue, and not all Muslims ranked it is one of the key considerations on which they voted, but it had an impact. Similarly, Israel policy is not necessarily a major consideration for all Jewish voters, and even for those for whom it is, there are those who are highly critical of the Israeli government and are at odds with the response of Labour under Starmer. But while over the decades the Jewish vote has swung between the two main parties broadly in line with the general population, it would appear that if one puts to one side all of the rows over antisemitism, the party’s outlook on Israel does impact voting intention. Separately, both Mish Rahman and Adam Langleben are very clear that their accusations of discrimination levelled at the party in different eras do not just relate to party policy on the Middle East. Even if everyone can be satisfied that accusations of discrimination are dealt with equally, such are the modern tensions around Middle East policy that political parties may struggle to find a position that does not alienate some members of one of these faith communities. Labour has achieved much in winning back the levels of Jewish voters it has, but it has also left huge swathes of loyal Muslim voters in Britain feeling politically adrift, and large swings in culture and policy over recent years leave many in each community needing convincing of the true nature of the party.

146,Rob Delaney says he wants to die in same room as his son,"The US actor and comedian Rob Delaney has said he wants to buy the home his son died in so he can also experience his last moments there. Delaney's two-year-old child Henry died in 2018 after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.  Delaney told Radio 4's Desert Island Discs he asked the landlord when he moved out: ""Listen, if you ever go to sell this place, let me know first because I would like to buy it. ""So when I'm 81 I can crawl in here and die. In the same room that my son died in, that my other son was born in."" Before Henry died, his parents told him they were expecting another child.  The Catastrophe and Deadpool 2 star said: ""He had to know that this family that loved him was alive and was growing and that there was somebody that we were going to tell about him. ""We knew that they would not overlap corporally on this Earth, even though Henry's younger brother was born in the same room that Henry died in, our living room."" Delaney, 47, told the programme that he and his wife, Leah, had considered leaving London but had continued to live in the city because of memories of Henry. ""For so many reasons, we've stayed, one of which is I like to go put my hands on slides at the playground that Henry slid down."" He added that he sometimes bumps into the nurses that looked after his son and said London and the NHS had taken very good care of his child. Delaney has previously described the NHS as ""the pinnacle of human achievement"" and that his family received ""truly unbelievable"" care while Henry was sick.  Delaney thought he would struggle with the birth of his new son, saying his heart had ""been torn into pieces and dissolved in salt"" and was just ""garbage"". But he told host Lauren Laverne that the ""nanosecond he exited my wife's body, I looked at him and just you know, started weeping and was so in love with him and just wanted to sniff them and eat them and put them into my shirt and squeeze them and I love him desperately. ""And then you have to feel and honour your pain. You have to let it hurt and you can't run away from it. When the feelings come it's best to let them."" Delaney also spoke about his recovery from alcoholism, saying he has been sober for more than two decades after a car crash prompted him to stop drinking.  He added: ""It's nothing more interesting than garden variety alcoholism, you know, I found that drinking just made me just feel better, complete, happier, relaxed. ""You know, anytime I took a drink, it was just like, 'this is it'. I first got drunk at 12 and then began to drink with more regularity at 14. ""I had alcoholism on both sides of my family.

147,"After Covid and Olympics, Tokyo’s first female governor set for third term","Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike is certain to win a third consecutive term in Sunday's gubernatorial election, according to exit polls. The 71-year-old first female governor of Japan's most populous city, will secure her position for another four years. Her victory will be a relief for struggling Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who backed the 71-year-old to win a third term. She was elected  in 2016, and won her second term in 2020. The conservative governor successfully guided the city through the coronavirus pandemic and its delayed summer Olympics in 2021. Japan’s tumbling fertility became a major issue during this campaign, and the victorious candidate will now have to work hard to improve Tokyo’s shockingly low birth rate. At 0.99 - less than one child per woman aged between 15 and 49 - it is the lowest of any region nationwide. Her appointment makes her one of the most powerful women in Japan's male dominated politics – with Tokyo accounting for about 11% of the population and contributing to nearly 20% of the country’s total GDP. It also puts her in charge of the city’s budget – which climbed to a staggering 16.55 trillion yen ($100bn; £80bn) this fiscal year. Ms Koike, 71, got more than 40% of the vote according to Reuters.   Declaring victory, Ms Koike said her main challenge was ""how to proceed with digital transformation as industries have changed significantly."" She said she would consolidate efforts to keep improving Tokyo, including ""the environment for women's empowerment"", which she said was ""insufficient [in Japan] compared to other parts of the world.""  Unexpectedly, Shinji Ishimaru, 41, an independent candidate and the former mayor of Akitakata, a town in Hiroshima prefecture, placed second, a position that was long thought to be guaranteed for Renho Saito.  Ms Renho, 56, supported by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), came in third. Mr Ishimaru, was relatively unknown in Tokyo before the official campaign began. During the election campaign, he focused on boosting his profile by reaching out to his large social media following. Mr Ishimaru's success is thought to be down to his appeal among young voters. As a former banker, he also focused on advancing the economy and industry of Tokyo.  After the polls closed, he told his supporters, ""I did all I could"", alluding to the fact that he had no particular party affiliation, unlike the two main contenders.   Yuriko Koike started her career as a journalist, working as a television news anchor before moving into politics in the early 1990s. But it was not until 2016 that she came to true national prominence after winning the governorship of Tokyo for the first time. She was not the official candidate of LDP, but still managed to win comfortably, taking more than 2.9 million votes to become the first woman in the role. ""I will lead Tokyo politics in an unprecedented manner, a Tokyo you have never seen,"" Ms Koike promised supporters on election night. She officially left the LDP in 2017 to set up her own political party, though she retains the support of many in the party – who gave her their backing in the 2024 race. Ms Koike vowed to focus on local issues during her term, including tackling overcrowding on public transport, as well as the culture of overworking in the city. But it was global issues that came to dominate her time in office. The emergence of Covid-19 forced Tokyo to delay its summer Olympics, planned for 2020. Ms Koike won a second term that year after her successful handling of the pandemic, and garnered further praise for managing the delayed Olympics, held in the city in 2021 in the shadow of the coronavirus. Ms Koike, however has not escaped scandal. An allegation that she never graduated from Cairo University – first reported during her first term – has never quite died away. Despite repeated denials from her and a statement confirming her graduation from the university itself, reports that she falsified her graduation documents still persisted during her try at a third gubernatorial term. Opponents also criticised her for failing to follow through on her pledges in Tokyo. The trains remain overcrowded and overwork culture remains a problem, they say. Of the 56 candidates the voters had to choose from, it had been expected Renho Saito would be Ms Koike's main opponent.  The former upper house member was backed by the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, as well as the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. Ms Renho left the CDP before official campaigning started on June 20. She lost her Upper House seat when she filed her candidacy. She rose to lead the centre-left group in 2016 as its first ever female head, but resigned a year later over poor results in Tokyo’s prefectural election. Japanese media projected the race as a proxy war between national parties, as the conservative incumbent was challenged by the left-leaning opposition politician.  The gubernatorial election also took place amid a climate of general mistrust towards politics. Critics say this is linked in part to the economic difficulties of the Japanese followed by an end of the long historical period of deflation, and the weakening of the yen.",2024-07-07 23:10:25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5gjjw20zo,"Toby Luckhurst,",2024-07-07 14:10:25,

152,Scammed by the fake Chinese police,"Chinese people around the world are being targeted by an elaborate scam in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police. A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station. Helen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China’s most wanted list. Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her £29,000 life savings as “bail money”, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. “I feel a bit stupid right now,” she says. “But there's no chance I can know that's not real. It's so convincing”. Helen’s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. China’s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams, as has the FBI after a number of cases in the US. One elderly woman in Los Angeles reportedly handed over $3m, believing it would stop her extradition. Typically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call. In Helen’s case it was somebody claiming to be a Chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name. Helen hadn’t sent anything, and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity. Although she was sceptical, Helen didn’t hang up. “Chinese people like myself because we were born and bred in China, we were taught obedience,” she says. “So when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it’s very rare that I will say no.” Helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in Shenzhen called “Officer Fang”. Helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call. When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed. Officer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo. “That moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',” Helen says. While they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her. Officer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.  “I said: 'That’s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they’re guilty. So it’s the evidence that counts'.” Helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison “He said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.” The scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night. Over the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life. Then Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her. Helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud. We have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it’s impossible to tell if what you’re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim. But for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: “After I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.” Helen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she’s a British citizen. “He told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.” Helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer £29,000. “I felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,” Helen says. But a few days later the fake police were back. Helen was ordered to find another £250,000 or be extradited: “I was fighting for my life - if I go back to China, I may never come back.” After Helen tried to borrow the money from a friend, he alerted her daughter. Helen broke down and revealed everything. But not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom, and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn’t listen in.  Her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam. Helen’s bank eventually refunded her money, but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending: “For two weeks I hardly slept. How can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone?""  In her sleep-deprived state, she crashed her car twice. On the second occasion, she wrecked it entirely: “I didn’t kill anyone, but I could have. These types of criminal scam could kill people.” Other victims of police impersonation scams have been pushed to even greater extremes.  In some extraordinary cases, some Chinese foreign students who can’t meet the financial demands of the fake police have been persuaded to fake their own kidnappings in order to seek a ransom from their families. Detective Superintendent Joe Doueihi of New South Wales Police fronted a publicity campaign to warn about so-called virtual or cyber-kidnappings, after a series of cases in Australia. “Victims are coerced into making their own video of them being in a vulnerable position, to appear as if they've been kidnapped - tied up with tomato sauce on their body to make it look like they've been bleeding, and calling for help from their loved ones,” he says. The students are then ordered to isolate themselves while the scammers send these images to families back in China, with a ransom demand. The scam victims may also find themselves being manipulated into helping to scam others. “Scammers will trick a victim into believing that they are working for the Chinese government. They will send them documentation and swear them in as a Chinese police officer,” Det Supt Doueihi says. He says the victim - who may have already handed over money to the criminals - is sent to monitor or intimidate other Chinese students in Australia. Many of these frauds are thought by experts to be run by Chinese organised crime groups operating from compounds in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. Chinese state media has reported that tens of thousands of suspects have been returned to China over the last year. Awareness of these types of scams is growing. We spoke to a student in Japan who realised he was being targeted by criminals, and recorded their conversation. He asked not to be named, but shared the recording with the BBC. In it, the scammers tell him that if he revealed anything about the call to anyone, then he would be jeopardising the ""investigation"". He refused to hand over any money and they stopped pursuing him. He’s aware that he had a lucky escape: ""I never thought it would happen to me. Just be really careful when you get a call from  a number that you don't recognise.” Additional reporting by Yi Ma  For more on this story: Watch  BBC Trending: Scammed by the fake Chinese Police – now on YouTube BBC World Service tells the story of scammers posing as Chinese police.",2024-07-07 23:10:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2lq0qk41o,"Elaine Chong and Ed Main,",2024-07-07 00:10:26,
151,"Project 2025: A wish list for a Trump presidency, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April 2023, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  Early this July, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted the Biden campaign to accuse Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have refocused attention on Project 2025. It is common for Washington think-tanks to propose policy wishlists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency.  In early July, Trump said on his social media platform that he knows ""nothing about Project 2025”.  “I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,"" he wrote.  ""Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them."" However, several people linked to the project worked in Trump's administration or as allies in his re-election campaign.  The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. Jared Huffman, a Democrat congressman from California, has launched a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. He described Project 2025 as ""a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions"". Mr Huffman said the project would ""abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in early June.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. In his speeches and on his website, Trump has endorsed a number of ideas included in Project 2025, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-07 23:10:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-07 20:10:26,
153,Forget Ethiopia's Spice Girls - this singer salutes the true queens,"Gabriella Ghermandi recalls with laughter the annoyance she felt about the so-called Ethiopian Spice Girls - charity-backed pop group Yegna that hoped to change narratives and empower girls and women through music. The all-female group sparked controversy in the UK because it was partly funded by British aid and some say it was a waste of taxpayers' money. But for Ghermandi, assumptions that Ethiopian women had to be taught by outsiders was the issue. “I was like, what?” Ghermandi tells the BBC. “They want to teach us how to empower women? Ethiopia? With all its epics of women?” So, Ghermandi - an Ethiopian-Italian author, singer, producer and ethno-musicologist - also turned to music as a way of “saying to the world that we have a huge history about brave women who had as much power as men”. The result is a nine-track album called Maqeda – the Amharic name for the Queen of Sheba, a hugely important figure in Ethiopian history.  Every song is an homage to female figures, communities, rituals and musical styles. Many would label this album Ethio-jazz but it encompasses so much more, says Ghermandi.  “It’s a very rooted Ethiopian music, but at the same time, there are very prog sounds, very rocky and punk sounds. You can find everything"". Maqeda was lovingly developed over four years, bringing together the Ethiopian and Italian musicians she has worked with since 2010 as the Atse Tewodros Project – plus Senegalese guest musicians, as well as a beat-boxer and a body music performer. “We wanted to digest the music,” says Ghermandi of the collaboration, adding that every musician had a role in the arrangements ""because I really wanted my two countries to be one”. Born in Addis Ababa in 1965, to a father from Italy and an Ethiopian-Italian mother, Ghermandi recalls the international feel of the capital city where she spent her early years. “Every place, every corner was [filled] with music and dance. And I think I learned the rhythm that has stayed in my blood,” she says. On the same street as her mother’s clothes shop was a record store run by a Greek woman which blasted out an array of sound from Congolese music to the Beatles.  Fela Kuti and other African greats played at the nightclubs where Ghermandi would tag along with her older brothers, while on Sundays there were tea-dancing parties at an Italian expat club. Although Ghermandi had no formal music training, a thorough immersion in Ethiopian musical styles came from the many wedding and church ceremonies that were part of family life. Travel was another constant in Ghermandi’s childhood – thanks to her father. In 1935 he left Italy to work in Eritrea, then an Italian colony. In 1955 he moved to Ethiopia and met her mother, who was 17 years younger. His jobs in construction took him to remote areas, and Ghermandi would often visit. She was only three months old when she was taken to the Rift Valley of southern Ethiopia. Her father wanted her to be given a moytse - or “sound name” - by the local Oyda people. For girls, a cow horn is blown – and whatever sound is heard by a very old and very young woman waiting together underneath a tree in the forest becomes the sound name. Ghermandi’s moytse is tumlele, tumlele, tumlelela. Her father died in 1978. By then, the military dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam ruled Ethiopia and so, in the early 1980s, by then a teenager, she moved to Italy. Ghermandi now lives between Italy and Ethiopia. But those cherished early experiences have stayed with her, and this latest album draws on childhood visits to Ethiopia’s remote communities as well as meticulous research as adult. Ghermandi says she started with the community she grew up with – the Dorze people originally from the southern highlands of Ethiopia, whose women head villages and sing in powerful polyphonic choirs. You can hear that way of singing – with up to six voices or parts, each with an independent but harmonising melody – in the song Boncho, which means “respect” in the Gamo language. Ghermandi worked with an Ethiopian female poet to create Set Nat (She is a Female), to counter a common saying in Ethiopia that when a woman achieves something it is because she is as brave as a man. “I hate this saying, because it used to tell me that it’s not enough to be a woman,” Ghermandi says with passion in her voice. “And I want to say to the world that being a woman is more than enough!” The song is led by a choir whose call-and-response has a distinct, rhythmic feel in a 7/4 time signature. “This is very typical of a part of Ethiopia – and it is a memory of my childhood,” she explains. Another track, Kotilidda, honours the matrilineal society of the Kunama people who live close to the borders with Eritrea and Sudan. It showcases the avangala, a two-stringed instrument which sounds like a bass guitar  - played only by the Kunama people. “I really wanted to mix the Ethiopian traditional instruments with modern instruments because Ethiopia does not promote enough its traditional instruments outside the country,” says Ghermandi. “I also want to show to Ethiopian artists that these instruments can have a dialogue with modern instruments - and be very modern at the same time, even if they are traditional.” Saba, meanwhile, sings of the legendary Queen of Sheba’s camel journey to Jerusalem to meet King Solomon.  The masinqo - a one-stringed fiddle - plays an ancient Hebrew melody at the end, in recognition of the belief that Ethiopia's Jewish community is descended from those who followed the son of Sheba when she returned home from what is now Israel. Ghermandi points out the parallels between that ancient, likely mythical, journey and the very real journeys taken today by many thousands of Ethiopians who have fled conflict, oppression, drought and poverty for a new life elsewhere. “In the song there’s the idea of walking - and the idea of facing all the things that you find during your journey.” Penny Dale is a freelance journalist, podcast and documentary-maker based in London Maqeda by the Atse Tewodros Project is released through Galileo MC Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

149,"She accused Assange of sexual assault, but is glad he’s now free","Swedish human rights activist Anna Ardin is glad Julian Assange is free. But the claims she has made about him suggest she would have every reason not to wish him well. She is one of two women who accused the WikiLeaks founder of sexual assault 14 years ago. The allegations - which Assange has always denied - were explosive, and made headlines across the world. They set off a chain of events which saw him trying to avoid extradition to Sweden by seeking asylum in a London embassy for seven years. In 2019 the Swedish authorities ended their investigation. However, he spent the next five years in a British prison fighting extradition to the US, where he faced prosecution over massive leaks of confidential information.  These include US army footage showing Iraqi civilians being killed, and documents suggesting the US military killed hundreds of Afghan civilians in unreported incidents. Assange was eventually freed last month, after a plea deal with the US. Ardin is fiercely proud of Assange's work for WikiLeaks, and insists that it should never have landed him behind bars. “We have the right to know about the wars that are fought in our name,” she says. “I’m sincerely happy for him and his family, that they can be together. The punishment he’s got has been very unproportionate.” Speaking to Ardin over Zoom in Stockholm, it quickly becomes clear that she has no problem keeping what she sees as the two Assanges apart in her head - the visionary activist and the man who she says does not treat women well. She is at pains to describe him neither as a hero nor a monster, but a complicated man. The 45-year-old activist is also a Christian deacon, with a belief in forgiveness, and she uses the words ""truth"" and ""transparency"" again and again throughout the interview. It might explain why she is in awe of what WikiLeaks accomplished but, at the same time, bitterly disappointed that the assault allegations she made against Assange were never formally tested. Ardin describes her encounter with Assange in her book, No Heroes, No Monsters: What I Learned Being The Most Hated Woman On The Internet. In 2010, just three weeks after WikiLeaks’ release of the Afghan war logs, she invited him to Stockholm to take part in a seminar organised by the religious wing of Sweden’s Social Democrats. Assange did not want to stay at a hotel for security reasons and Ardin was due to be away, so she offered him her flat. But she returned early. After an evening of discussing politics and human rights, they ended up having what she describes as uncomfortable sex during which she says he humiliated her. Ardin says she was pressured into having sex with Assange and stressed he must use a condom, but the condom broke and he continued. She says he deliberately broke the condom. If this was the case, he probably would have committed an offence under Swedish law. Later, Ardin writes that she heard from another woman - named in legal papers as SW - who had attended the seminar. SW apparently said that Assange had penetrated her without her consent when she was asleep.  In a 2016 statement to Swedish prosecutors, Assange maintained that his sexual relationship with SW was entirely consensual, and that in texts seen by his lawyers, she told a friend that she had been “half asleep”. Both women filed police reports - Ardin's case was categorised as alleged sexual misconduct, and SW's as alleged rape. The press got hold of the reports, setting off an extraordinary series of events. Assange denied the allegations, and suggested that they were a US set-up. WikiLeaks had just leaked 76,000 US military documents - sparking massive global attention and scrutiny of US foreign policy. On 21 August, 2010, WikiLeaks tweeted: “We were warned to expect ‘dirty tricks’. Now we have the first one.” Another post followed the next day: “Reminder: US intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks as far back as 2008.” Assange’s UK lawyer Mark Stephens claimed that a “honeytrap” had been sprung and that “dark forces” were at work. A social media furore erupted which Ardin describes as “hell” – she tells me the amount of harassment and death threats forced her to leave Sweden at one point. “I couldn’t work. My life passed me by for two years.” To this day, many believe Ardin is part of a US conspiracy, and that her allegations are false. Greece’s former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, a long-time supporter of Assange, last week described her claims as “mud” and “innuendo”. No evidence has ever been found to link Ardin with US intelligence. She concedes that the narratives spread by Assange had an air of plausibility, because he had been “messing with the Pentagon”, but says the claims were nothing but “lies” and a “smear campaign”. Months after the incidents, an international arrest warrant was issued for Assange, who was in London at that point. In December 2010, he admitted to the BBC that it was “not probable” he was part of a classic honey-trap operation - but he still denied any wrongdoing. Assange was convinced that if he went to Sweden he would then be extradited to the US - where he feared the death penalty awaited. In 2012, he took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Sweden refused to guarantee he would not be extradited to the US, but said any move to do so would need to be approved by the UK too. Both countries also said they would not extradite him if they thought he might face the death penalty. In 2015, Swedish prosecutors dropped the investigation into Ardin’s allegations as time had run out.  In 2019, prosecutors abandoned their investigation into SW's claims, saying the  evidence had “weakened considerably due to the long period of time since the events in question”. By this time, Assange was being held in London’s high-security Belmarsh prison, facing extradition to the US on espionage charges. If convicted there, he could have faced 170 years behind bars. Assange finally won his freedom in 2024, after agreeing to plead guilty to a single charge under the US Espionage Act.  Ardin still wishes he had faced trial for the alleged assault against her. “But he won’t. So I have to let it go.” She says some of her doubters don’t take her seriously because they don’t think the details of her experience, or reaction, were dramatic enough. She suggests there’s an expectation of sexual assault to always be brutal, involve a lot of violence, and leave the victim heavily traumatised - and if that doesn’t happen you can’t be a real victim, or a real offender. But that doesn’t align with what Ardin describes as the reality of her experience. She stresses that doesn’t make it any less serious or unacceptable.  She slams many of Assange's supporters - and journalists - for seeking a “one-sided narrative” which turns him into a hero, and her into an evil CIA agent. “I think that we have a problem that we have to have these heroes that are flawless… I don’t think heroes exist outside fairytales.” Ardin says her intention was never to write off Assange as a one-dimensional villain, to be “kicked out of society”. Offenders are seen as “monsters, completely different from all other men"", she says. And this means the “system goes on”, she argues, as “normal” men don’t realise that they, too, can be prone to violence - so they don’t interrogate themselves. “I want him to be seen as a normal guy. That's what normal guys do sometimes. They cross other people's boundaries.” She thinks that progressive movements often have problems calling out leaders, fearing any criticism delegitimises the entire cause. “You can't be a leader and abuse the people who are active in your movement, because the movement will not survive.” People should not be able to get away with sexual crimes, or any crimes just because they’re influential, she adds. The BBC contacted Assange's lawyers for comment on the claims repeated by Ardin in our interview with her, but they said he was ""not in a position to respond"". I ask what justice would have looked like for her at the end of this saga. Ardin tells me she is only interested in getting to what she describes as the truth. She is less interested in punishment. “Justice for me would have been to have transparency. I was not happy that he was locked up because he was [locked up] for the wrong reason.” Ardin is a left-wing Christian who attaches great importance to reconciliation and transformation. But for that to be possible, she says that perpetrators need to own up and genuinely commit to change. After all this contemplation, I wonder what she would say to Assange, if face to face with him now. Ardin tells me she would urge him to work on himself. She would ask him to admit that he “did not have the right to do what he did to me, and he doesn’t have that right towards other women either"". “He has to admit that for himself… He has to reflect on what he did.” If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line",2024-07-07 23:10:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1jgv3knnwo,"Phelan Chatterjee,",2024-07-06 23:10:26,
150,The far right came close to power in France. What about the rest of Europe?,"How likely is France to wake up on Monday morning to a new far-right dawn? That was the garishly painted, hotly debated scenario in media headlines, the EU in Brussels and seats of government across Europe following the first round of France’s parliamentary vote. But despite the spectacular showing by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party last week, the RN has failed to achieve a majority. French centrist and leftist parties strategically withdrew candidates to bolster each other’s contenders ahead of Sunday’s decisive second round. But the impact of this election will be seismic, as the RN is still expected to greatly increase its representation in parliament. That means a decades-old taboo will have been shattered in France, a core EU nation. The EU was born out of the ashes of World War Two. It was originally designed as a peace project, with wartime enemies, France and Germany, at its core. Far-right parties were banished to the outer fringes of European politics. Last month, world leaders gathered in northern France to mark 80 years since D-Day, the allied amphibious assault in Normandy that helped secure the defeat of Nazi Germany. But now, “far-right” or “hard-right” or “populist nationalist” parties are part of coalition governments in a number of EU countries, including the Netherlands, Italy and Finland. There are challenges in labelling these parties. Their policies frequently change. They also vary from country to country. And their normalisation is not an entirely new phenomenon. Former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, a centre-right politician, was the first EU leader to take the plunge. He formed a government with the post-fascist political group, Movimento Sociale Italiano, back in 1994. Six years later, Austria’s conservatives went into coalition with the far-right Freedom Party. At the time, the EU was so outraged that it blocked official bilateral contacts with Austria for several months. Post-war political etiquette dictated the political mainstream must form a cordon sanitaire, a “health barrier”, at election time to keep the extreme right out of European governments. The universally recognised term for that practice is French, which gives you a sense how passionately many in France felt about it. In the 2002 Presidential election, some French voters clipped a clothes peg to their noses on their way to polling stations - a way of showing they’d vote for a candidate they didn’t really like, just  to keep out the far right. This was a far right that for years was led by Marine Le Pen’s father, with French former members of a Nazi-led Waffen SS unit in his party ranks. Fast-forward to 2024, and Marine Le Pen’s ambition, 10 years in the making, to detoxify her father’s party – changing its name and trying hard to clean up its image - appears to have been a roaring success. The cordon sanitaire now has a searing gash in it, after the leader of France’s centre-right Les Républicains struck a deal with the RN not to compete against each other this Sunday in specific constituencies. This was an earthquake in French politics. Crucially for Marine Le Pen, those who support her aren’t embarrassed to admit it any more. The RN is no longer viewed as an extremist protest movement. For many, it offers a credible political programme, whatever its detractors claim. French voters trust the RN more than any other party to manage their economy and (currently poor) public finances, according to an Ipsos poll for the Financial Times newspaper. This is despite the party’s lack of government experience and its largely unfunded tax-cutting and spending plans. Which begs the question, when you observe the angst-ridden despair in liberal circles in Europe at the growing success of the so-called “New Right”: if traditional lawmakers had served their electorates better, perhaps there’d be less of an opening for European populists to walk into? By populists, I mean politicians like Ms Le Pen who claim to listen to and speak on behalf of “ordinary people”, defending them against “the establishment”. This “them and us” argument is extremely effective when voters feel anxious and ignored by governing powers. Just look at Donald Trump in the US, the sudden unexpected breakthrough of Reform UK in Thursday’s UK election and the huge success of Germany’s controversial anti-migration AfD party. In France, many perceive President Macron - a former merchant banker - as arrogant, privileged and remote from the everyday cares of ordinary people outside the Paris bubble. A man who made difficult lives even tougher, they say, by raising the national pension age and trying to put up fuel prices, citing environmental concerns. It must be a source of frustration for France’s president that his success at lowering unemployment rates and the billions of euros he spent trying to soften the economic effects of the Covid and energy crises seem largely forgotten. Meanwhile, the RN concentrated much of its campaign on the cost-of-living crisis. The party has pledged to cut taxes on gas and electricity and to raise the minimum wage for low earners. Priorities like these mean the RN should no longer be labelled a far-right movement, its supporters insist. They point to a widening support base and say the party shouldn’t be forever tarnished by its racist roots under Le Pen senior. A similar argument echoes out of Rome. Italy’s Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, once used to praise fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Her Brothers of Italy party has post-fascist roots but she now heads one of the EU’s most stable governments. She recently censured a meeting of her party’s youth wing. Members had been filmed giving fascist salutes. There was no room in her party for nostalgia for the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century, she said. While critics at home warn of attempts to influence Italy’s media landscape and Ms Meloni’s attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, her concrete proposals to tackle irregular migration have won plaudits from the European mainstream, including the EU Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, and the UK’s recently ousted prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Frankly, on hot-button issues like migration, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the political rhetoric of the far right in Europe and traditional mainstream politicians intentionally sharpening their speeches to try to hold on to voters. Former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was a prime example of this, and Emmanuel Macron too, the more he’s felt the heat of Marine Le Pen’s popularity. One of the inadvertent effects of mainstream politicians aping parties further to their right on migration is that it makes the original anti-immigration parties seem more respectable, acceptable and electable.  Witness the recent stellar performance in the Netherlands’ general election of anti-migration politician Geert Wilders, who has been regularly accused of hate speech. The label “far right” is one that needs to be debated. Much depends on the make-up of each party. But the kind of acceptance now enjoyed by Ms Meloni in wider international circles is still a remote dream for Ms Le Pen. The most likely outcome in France is a paralysed hung parliament or an unruly coalition government of non-Le Pen parties. Any and all of these scenarios reduce Emmanuel Macron to a pretty lame-duck president. Political instability at home means big EU powers, France and also Germany, are turning inwards at a time of great global uncertainty. Wars rage in Gaza and Ukraine. EU and Nato-sceptic Donald Trump is poised to possibly return to the White House. It’s a precarious moment for Europe to be without leadership. Voters feel exposed. Even if not this Sunday, Marine Le Pen’s followers firmly believe their time is coming. Soon.

154,Israeli air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16,"At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured.  The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel said it had struck several Hamas “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”. A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were ""very, very serious"" and should be investigated.   The attack comes as hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon, following months of false starts. Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas. It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to ""pretty significant adjustments"" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire.  A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war.   Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.  The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter. One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit. ""This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning,"" she said. Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted.  More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders.  Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken ""numerous steps"" to ""mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence"". Hamas militants were using the location as a ""hideout"" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said. ""Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,"" it added. Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.  Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. ""We don’t have all the information yet. Since the war began, we have had more than  half of our facilities hit,"" Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.   ""Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Many were women and children."" She added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated.  A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. The head of the Unrwa described the June incident as ""horrific"" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was ""shocking"" but could not be confirmed. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. The organisation has rejected this.  In April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

155,'I want to work with fast cars and travel the world',"Andy Stephenson has spent more than 30 years in motorsport and is now at Aston Martin One of the bosses of the Aston Martin Formula One team said he was in his ""dream job"" as he prepares for his team's home Grand Prix on Sunday. Andy Stephenson has spent more than 30 years in the sport, starting with the Jordan motor racing team in the late 80s. He is now the sporting director of Silverstone-based Aston Martin, which returned to Formula One in 2021. The 56-year-old said: ""When I was at school, I went to the careers office [and] said 'I want to work with fast cars and travel the world'."" He said he was told he ""won't find a job like that, but fortunately I did"". Aston Martin returned to Formula One in 2021 After returning to the sport, Aston Martin leapt from the midfield to be regular podium contenders at the start of 2023. In 2024, the team have had several top-six qualifying positions for lead driver Fernando Alonso and sit fifth in the constructors' championship after 11 of 24 races. Stephenson said that although there have been significant changes in technology since he started in Formula One, ""the aim is still exactly the same"". ""We want to go racing; we want to win races; we want to be competitive; and we eventually want to win World Championships,"" he said. He said once the Silverstone site in Northamptonshire is fully open the team will have ""close to 1,000 staff"". ""It's certainly changed from the day I first walked into the factory owned by Eddie Jordan, where there were eight of us,"" he said. Stephenson, who is from Northampton, began as an engineer and now represents the team in discussions with the sports governing body, the FIA. He said: ""It is a lot of fun and has a lot of challenges; it's not all champagne and trophies, but something that's really, really enjoyable and a job that I love."" Former World Champion Fernando Alonso is one of the teams drivers The sporting director said Silverstone was a circuit ""that's very special to my heart"". He said: ""My mum used to work here as a young girl at the weekend selling burgers and hot dogs and I have been working here ever since, so it is really special.

156,French people reject the far right  - again,"The French have said it again: they do not want the far right in power. They gave them a big win in the European elections; they gave them a big win in the first round of this parliamentary election. But when it came to a vote that really counted, just as in the presidentials, they drew back from the brink. This surprise upset which has reduced the National Rally (RN) to third place – with perhaps 150 seats compared with predictions a week ago of nearly 300 – is due entirely to voters turning out in large numbers to stop them. The RN will argue – with some justice – that this was only possible because the other parties came together to play the system. They note that the disparate parties of the left all suddenly forgot their differences to form a new anti-RN coalition;  and then that the Macronites and the left forgot their differences too. They note that nothing unites these politicians (from Edouard Philippe on the centre right to Philippe Poutou of the Trotskyist left) except their opposition to the RN.  And that this lack of agreement bodes ill for the future. Nonetheless, the fact remains. Most people do not want the far right – either because they oppose its ideas, or because they fear the unrest that would inevitably attend its coming to power. So if Jordan Bardella will not be the country’s next prime minister, who will be? That is the great unknown. And contrary to convention following previous French parliamentary elections, it may be weeks before we have an answer. Because something has happened these past tense weeks to change the very nature of the French political system.  As Alain Duhamel — veteran of every election since Charles de Gaulle – put it: “Today there is no longer any dominant party. Since Macron came to power seven years ago, we have been in a period of deconstruction of our political forces. “Perhaps now we are beginning a period of reconstruction.” What he means is that there is now a multitude of political forces: three major blocs (left, far-right and centre); plus the centre-right.  And within these there are competing tendencies and parties. With no party able to call the shots in the Assembly, a long period of haggling is now inevitable aimed at forming a new coalition from the centre-right through to the left. It is far from obvious how it will be formed – given the mutual loathing that the different potential components have expressed till now. But we can bet that President Macron will now call for a period of apaisement – conciliation – after the tensions of the last weeks. Conveniently this period will last through the Olympics and the summer holidays, allowing the French to recover their spirits. In the meantime, he will designate somebody to lead the talks and reach out to the different parties. Will it be someone from the left? Will it be someone from the centre?  Will it be a political outsider?  We do not know. What seems certain though is that France is about to enter a more parliamentary system.   Power will drain from President Macron, and towards whoever heads the new government. Even if he manages to place a centrist in the prime ministership (far from easy, given the strength of the left) that person will exercise power in his or her own right, and on the basis of parliamentary support.  Macron – with no prospect of running again in 2027 – will be a diminished figure. So has the president lost his bet?  Is he regretting his haste in calling the elections?  Is he ready to take a backward step? We can be sure that is not the way Macron sees it.  He will be saying that he called the vote because the situation was untenable; that he has clarified politics,  offered the RN a fairer share of Assembly seats, given their widespread support; and  that his gamble that the French would never put the far-right in power was correct. And in the meantime, he has not exactly gone away.  Macron’s power may be on the wane.  But he is still there at the Elysée, consulting with his team, prodding politicians,  still master of the political clock.",2024-07-07 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrlxn4ngdgo,"Hugh Schofield,",2024-07-07 21:10:28,
157,French left celebrates as far right faces surprise defeat,"France's far-right National Rally was widely expected to win this snap election, but projections say they have been beaten into third place. A left-wing alliance called New Popular Front are on course for victory, after a highly charged and abbreviated election called only four weeks ago by a weakened President Emmanuel Macron. National Rally (RN) won the first round of this election, and all the opinion polls since then predicted victory in the run-off round.  Instead, France is heading for a hung parliament with no party having anything like a majority. RN leader Jordan Bardella blamed ""unnatural political alliances"" for stopping their rise to power.  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who was appointed by President Macron only seven months ago, said he would hand in his resignation in the morning, although he pointed out that his Ensemble alliance were on course to win three times the number of seats that had been forecast. That was in part because 217 candidates, mainly from the left alliance and the Macron camp, had dropped out of the race to help their political rivals defeat RN.  Plenty of people were unhappy about it, but it meant that voters who had backed the centre or the left in the first round then pivoted to a rival party a week later, with the single aim of keeping the far right from taking control of parliament. Mr Bardella complained that millions of French voters had been deprived of a response to France's cost of living crisis by what he condemned as ""alliances of dishonour"". ""We don't want power for power's sake, but to hand it to the French people"" Mr Bardella told his supporters.  Party colleague Sébastien Chenu accused the Macron alliance of enabling a left-wing victory, leaving France in a ""quagmire"" conjured up by the president. That alliance has now left France heading for a hung parliament, but also in uncharted territory because the biggest group in the left-wing alliance is led by the radical and abrasive Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose France Unbowed is widely seen as far left by his rivals. A projection for TF1 TV gave France Unbowed (LFI) up to 94 seats, by far the most in his alliance. He was quick to seize the moment, telling his supporters: ""The president's defeat is clear; the president must accept his defeat, the prime minister must go."" A little more than an hour later Mr Attal - unlike President Macron, a highly popular politician - said he would do just that.  In an address from his residence at Hôtel Matignon, he said French voters had rejected the prospect of an extreme government. He praised all the candidates who had withdrawn from the race to stop RN from winning. ""Tomorrow morning I will hand in my resignation,"" he said. ""A new era starts tonight.""  Turning to the millions of voters who backed the far right he added: ""I respect every one of you, because there are no categories of French people who vote right and those of vote wrong."" His fate is now in the president's hands as France needs a stable government during the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July. Mr Attal said he was ready to remain in post ""for as long as duty demands"". But there are few people in the New Popular Front who are happy for him to stay in office. ""The president has the power and the duty to call us, the New Popular Front to govern. We are ready,"" Mr Mélenchon declared. Hastily cobbled together when Mr Macron stunned France with this two-round vote, the alliance includes Greens, Communists and Socialists as well as France Unbowed. Greens leader Marine Tondelier agreed the Popular Front was now ready to govern France: ""We've won and now we're going to govern France."" But she said now was not the time to push for a new prime minister. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said ""France has said no to the far right coming to power. The far right made the choice of dividing the French people."" One of France's best-regarded politicians, former Macron prime minister Edouard Philippe, said the election campaign had led to great uncertainty in France.  While a ""crushing majority"" of the French people had said no to RN, they had also not given the left a majority to govern. It was now, he said, up to centrist political forces to seek a deal that would re-establish stability in France after weeks of tensions.

158,Slovak PM in first public appearance since shooting,"The Slovakian prime minister has made his first public appearance since being wounded in an assassination attempt. Robert Fico was shot several times on 15 May while greeting people outside a cultural centre in Handlova, about 180km (112 miles) from the capital Bratislava, after holding a meeting there. He was rushed to hospital to undergo emergency surgery, before later being discharged to receive care at home. On Friday, Mr Fico spoke during a ceremony at Devin Castle in Bratislava to mark Saints Cyril and Methodius Day, a public holiday in Slovakia. Cyril and Methodius were brothers credited with converting Slavic people in the region to Christianity in the 9th Century and creating an early version of the Cyrillic alphabet. Mr Fico, 59, used a speech at the commemoration to criticise the supposed expansion of progressive ideologies and the West's stance towards Russia over the war in Ukraine. He said ""meaningless"" liberal ideas were ""spreading like cancer"", and that there were ""not enough peace talks"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the Russian invasion, according to local and international media reports. Mr Fico, a populist who returned to office last October, is a divisive figure both domestically and within the wider EU, with calls to end military aid to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. He has also proposed abolishing Slovakia's public broadcaster. His attacker, previously named as 71-year-old Jurac C, has been described as a writer and political activist. Footage of the incident shows a gun being pulled in the crowd and five shots ringing out. The Slovakian PM was then bundled into a car by his bodyguards while the suspected shooter was detained at the scene. In a video address posted on social media on 5 June, Mr Fico said he forgave his assailant and felt no hatred towards him, while blaming the attack on his parliamentary opposition.",2024-07-07 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevwkjdxyvlo,"Aleks Phillips,",2024-07-06 23:10:28,

Second seed Gauff was the highest-ranked player remaining, following Iga Swiatek's surprise defeat by Yulia Putintseva on Saturday. But the 20-year-old followed the world number one out of the door at SW19 after falling to a 6-4 6-3 defeat by 19th seed Navarro. It meant there were just two top-10 players remaining in the women's draw - fourth seed Elena Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini, who is seeded seventh. Wimbledon has been Gauff's toughest Grand Slam to crack having never gone past the fourth round. She has made it to the semi-finals of the Australian Open and Roland Garros, while she won her first major at last year's US Open. Navarro will play Italian Paolini, who is also into the Wimbledon last eight for the first time after a tearful Madison Keys retired with an injury in the deciding set of their match. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam tournament in which Coco Gauff has not reached the quarter-finals Gauff had breezed through the first three rounds at this year's Championships, underlining her title credentials with commanding wins.  But in her first test against a player in the world's top 20, unforced errors came to the fore while she struggled to deal with the variety of Navarro's game.  The pair looked evenly matched in the first set, trading breaks before Navarro struck a decisive blow with a forehand winner at 5-4. Despite being cheered on with chants of ""let's go Coco, let's go"", Gauff couldn't find a way back after her opponent broke for a 3-1 lead in the second.  ""I don’t have a ton of words but just really grateful to be out here on Centre Court,""  said Navarro, who sealed the biggest win of her career on her third match point. ""A tournament with so much history and tradition that so many legends have played on before - it's a real honour."" The win continued a breakthrough season for the Navarro, who is into the last eight of a Grand Slam for the first time. The 23-year-old won her first WTA title at the Hobart International in January, while she also reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time at last month's French Open.

She appeared to pick up the injury when she hit a forehand while serving for victory at 5-2 in the final set. Keys, 29, took a medical timeout at the change of ends when leading 5-4 and was treated before leaving the court. The 12th seed reappeared with strapping high on her thigh and was clearly hampered by the injury. Paolini, 28, broke again to level at 5-5 before Keys decided she could no longer continue. ""Right now I'm so sorry for her,"" said Paolini. ""To end the match like this is bad. What can I say?  ""I think we played a really good match. It was tough, a lot of ups and downs. I'm feeling a bit happy but also sad for her. It's not easy to win like that."" French Open finalist Paolini had never won a match in the Wimbledon main draw before this year's tournament. After winning the first set, she trailed in the second 5-1 but rallied brilliantly to force a tie-break - which Keys eventually took on her fourth set point.

He put the video up on his Instagram account and, despite deleting the post, it has still been shared on social media. Jaminet has been sent home from the tour and the French Rugby Federation said it ""condemns comments"" made by the 25-year-old ""in a video broadcast on social media"". It added: ""Such comments are totally unacceptable and are contrary to the fundamental values of our sport.

162,Olise joins Bayern from Palace on five-year deal,"Michael Olise played half of Crystal Palace's Premier League matches last season as he was hampered with a hamstring injury Bayern Munich have signed winger Michael Olise from Crystal Palace for about 60m euros (£50m). The 22-year-old English-born France Under-21 forward made 90 appearances in all competitions over three seasons with Palace. Olise, who joined the Eagles from Reading for £8m in July 2021, has signed a five-year deal. Chelsea and Newcastle United registered their interest in Olise earlier this summer but the winger has chosen to move to Germany, where he will work under Bayern's new manager Vincent Kompany. ""I'm very happy to now be playing for such a big club - it's a great challenge and that's exactly what I was looking for,"" said Olise. ""I want to prove myself at this level and play my part in ensuring we win as many titles as possible in the coming years."" Olise scored 10 goals in 19 Premier League appearances as Palace finished 10th in the table last season. He has been selected in the France squad for the Olympics that start in Paris later this month. ""We are hugely proud of what Michael has achieved at Crystal Palace, a club where he has developed greatly as a player,"" said Eagles chairman Steve Parish. ""We respect his desire to further test himself at the highest level of world football."" Bayern are also set to complete the signing of Fulham's Joao Palhinha in a deal worth £42m plus £4m in add-ons. The 28-year-old Portugal midfielder was close to joining Bayern last summer but a deal collapsed on deadline day. England defender Eric Dier has also joined the Bundesliga club permanently after playing for them on loan from Tottenham Hotspur since January. Bayern's 11-year hold on the German title was ended by Bayer Leverkusen last season.

163,Alcaraz into last eight as 'high level' overcomes Humbert,"This video can not be played Alcaraz sees off Humbert to reach last eight Carlos Alcaraz inched a step closer to defending his Wimbledon title with a hard-fought victory over Ugo Humbert. The 21-year-old Spaniard held off a late charge from 16th seed Humbert to win 6-3 6-4 1-6 7-5 and move into the last eight at SW19. It took Alcaraz's winning streak at Grand Slams to 11 following his French Open triumph last month. ""I feel great playing today, I think I played a really high level,"" he said. ""Playing a leftie, I try not to think about it and play my own game."" Alcaraz will next face American 12th seed Tommy Paul, the Queen's Club champion, who defeated Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. Meanwhile, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated American 14th seed Ben Shelton 6-2 6-4 7-6 (11-9). Shelton, who won in five sets in his first three rounds, had four set points in the third-set tie-break. Sinner, 22, will play Daniil Medvedev next after the Russian fifth seed benefitted from Grigor Dimitrov's early retirement with a leg injury. The Bulgarian 10th seed took a medical timeout before deciding, at 5-3 down in the first set, not to continue. Keys injury retirement sends Paolini into last eight It seemed unlikely Sunday's opening match on Centre Court would live up to the five-set classic Alcaraz played against Frances Tiafoe on Friday. And it became even more improbable when, with little effort, he found himself two sets up in what appeared a relatively dull encounter. But the three-time major winner suddenly faltered in the third set and Humbert stepped up to take advantage. The Frenchman, 26, raised his intensity, hitting the chalk with brilliant winners and breaking serve three times to force a fourth set. Both players struggled to hold in a tense set, and an increasingly frustrated Alcaraz turned to the crowd and his team for help, waving his arms animatedly to stir up support. With their backing, the defending champion found another gear, impressively holding his serve under immense pressure and breaking for a 6-5 lead. Alcaraz then served out the match and, relieved, he applauded all four corners of Centre Court in appreciation. This video can not be played Sinner beats Shelton in straight sets Under the roof on Court One, Shelton, perhaps feeling the effects of playing on a sixth day out of seven in the tournament so far, fell two sets down in just over an hour. However, Shelton fought back in the third and used a boisterous Court One crowd to break for a 2-0 lead. Australian Open champion Sinner pulled level and pulled off a stunning between-the-legs shot from a deep Shelton return that drew gasps from the crowd. After saving the set points, Sinner's victory was secured when Shelton double-faulted at 10-9 down. ""It was a tough match, especially the third set. I had to keep saving set point. These matches can go long but I was glad to close it in three,"" said Sinner.

160,Wimbledon run has 'fuelled the fire' - Raducanu,"This video can not be played Sun knocks out Raducanu with impressive win Britain's Emma Raducanu says an encouraging Wimbledon run has ""fuelled the fire"" to continue her upward trajectory over the rest of the season. Raducanu, 21, was beaten 6-2 5-7 6-2 by New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun in the fourth round on Sunday. It was a disappointing exit after a series of dominant performances had heightened excitement at the All England Club. But, having reached the fourth round of a major for the first time since winning the 2021 US Open, Raducanu reflected positively on the past week. ""I feel good about things going forwards. I feel optimistic,"" said Raducanu, who is set to move back inside the world's top 100 next week. ""As bitter as it is to take, I think [this defeat] happened for a reason.  ""You don't want things to happen too easily and too quickly. I had that before. I don't necessarily want just a massive spike."" Raducanu, who was given a wildcard for the All England Club, was outplayed for much of a fascinating contest. Having won six matches in a row on the SW19 grass, Sun oozed confidence and hit a flurry of winners. Raducanu wrestled back momentum by winning the second set but lost serve early in the decider shortly after needing treatment following a fall. The opening game of the third set was stopped and she received treatment - on her leg and back - while laid out on the court. Having missed last year's Wimbledon after having operations on both wrists and her ankle, she added: ""Six months ago when I was starting out after surgery, I would have signed for the fourth round at Wimbledon.  ""Of course I'm disappointed. Of course I want more. ""It fuels the fire and makes me more hungry."" Raducanu's defeat came a day after she pulled out of a planned mixed doubles appearance alongside fellow Briton Andy Murray, citing ""stiffness"" in her right wrist. Even though it was a sensible precaution - she had needed surgery on the same wrist last year - the move led to some criticism, given it denied Murray the chance to play again in his Wimbledon farewell. Raducanu said it was a ""tough"" decision, adding she still stood by ""making the right call"". ""With every decision, people are entitled to their opinions. Of course, there was a bit of a cloud around the decision,"" she said. ""I don't think I would have done it any other way.  ""I think in this sport, especially as an individual, you have to make your own calls and prioritise yourself.  ""Especially with my history, I just had to put myself first."" Raducanu knocked out of Wimbledon by qualifier Sun Ashleigh Barty, Australian former world number one and 2019 Wimbledon champion, on BBC TV I think this is a beautiful foundation for Emma to build from.  Her career has been back to front in a way. She flipped the script and went right to the top, won a Grand Slam.  This is her chance to use her experience but it's also a restart.  You have to be accountable for your own actions and understand there are consequences and she's comfortable with that.  I think she has a better life balance now and she's enjoying her tennis.

159,I thought it was never going to happen again - Hamilton,"Hamilton has won a record nine times at Silverstone, and has a straight named after him Lewis Hamilton has had to wait for it, but he finally had his moment of redemption at the British Grand Prix and returned to the top step of a Formula 1 podium - two years, seven months and two days since he last stood there. In doing so, he broke the record for wins at a single track, and did it in front of his home crowd and his family. “I can’t stop crying,” he said straight after climbing out of his car. Later, he said: “That might be the most emotional ending to a race I think I have probably ever had.” To understand those tears, you have to consider what Hamilton has been through in that period. His last victory was at the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, as his fierce title fight with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen came to a dramatic climax. A week later, in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton lost the chance to win a record eighth championship after the then race director, Michael Masi, made up the rules as he went along in a late safety-car period. Over the winter that followed, Hamilton thought about walking away from the sport. Instead, he came back determined to right what he perceived as a wrong, a title that he felt was robbed from him. Only to find that his Mercedes team - after eight consecutive world constructors’ titles - had lost their way following the introduction of new rules. In the 945 days between his last win and this one, Hamilton said on Sunday, he had doubted himself; doubted, too, whether another victory would ever come. “The adversity we have gone thought as a team and I have personally experienced,” he said, ""the constant challenge, like we all have, to get out of bed every day and give it your best shot. “So many times when you feel like your best shot is not good enough, and the disappointment sometimes you can feel. “We live in a time when mental health is such a serious issue and I am not going to lie (and deny) that I have experienced that. “There have definitely been moments between 2021 and here when I didn’t feel like I was good enough, or I thought it was never going to happen again. I have never cried coming from a win. It just came out of me. It is a really great feeling and I am really grateful for it.” Over the past two years, with a few exceptions, he has generally avoided talking about Abu Dhabi and its impact on him. But this time he let it out. “Honestly, when I came back in 2022, I thought that I was over it,” Hamilton said. “And I know I wasn’t, and it's taken a long time to heal that kind of feeling. That's only natural for anyone that has that experience. I've just been continuing to try and work on myself and find that inner peace day by day.” The emotions at Silverstone were so intense because so many aspects of his life journey had come together at once. Not just the end of a long, long win drought. But his home grand prix, in front of a crowd that adores him and cheered his every move, even when he was fighting with another Briton, Lando Norris. On a track that he said he considered the “best in the world”. On top of that, he is in his last season with Mercedes, who have backed him since he was 13, before he moves to Ferrari next season; his desire to end his career with them on a high. And an appreciation of time passing, and of valuable personal moments spent with the people he loves most in the world - his father, mother, brother, sister and her children were all at Silverstone with him. “Your parents are getting older, you know. We're travelling so much,” Hamilton said. “Time with family is a constant challenge. My niece and nephew are growing up and growing out of their cuteness. But I've had them here this weekend. “We all try to be there for each other, even at a distance. I know I've always had their support, but to be able to see them there and share this experience, they wanted to be at my last race, the last British Grand Prix with this team that have been so incredible to us. “Mercedes obviously supported me since I was 13. So it's definitely meant the most today to have them there and to be able to share it with them.” Hamilton wins British GP for ninth time Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Hamilton triumphed in a race that ebbed and flowed, from a dry start, through two periods of wet weather into a dry finish, and in which the winner was in doubt until the very end. Hamilton had qualified second to team-mate George Russell and they ran that way through the early laps. The McLarens of Norris and Oscar Piastri came to the fore in the wet middle period, only to fumble their pit strategy, and hand the win to Hamilton at the final pit stops, when Verstappen also came back into the frame after an unusually uncompetitive race for him was turned by Red Bull’s final tyre choice. Verstappen charged by Norris to take second, and then chased down Hamilton, who held on to win by just over a second. In the dry early phase, the Mercedes were clearly the fastest cars on track, and Hamilton managed his soft tyres in the closing laps expertly, while Norris’ fell off badly. It was confirmation that Mercedes really are finally back in the battle at the front after a long, trying period. It has happened so quickly. As Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff put it: “Five races ago, we weren’t contenders for the podium and it looked like we were in the third year of non-performance, and then it clicked.” The “click” moment, Wolff said, was largely down to the input of James Allison, who was reinstalled as Mercedes technical director in the spring of last year when Mercedes realised they had messed up their car for the second year in succession. “There was a moment where, led by James, suddenly the data made sense,” Wolff said. ""The way we made it, the way we balanced the car. And how we could bring it in a better sweet spot. That was the main thing. It wasn’t a miracle front wing, it was more the balance we achieved.” For his part, Allison explains the transition as one of culture inside the team. He says it took Mercedes too long to realise that the rules introduced in 2022 “require a different set of skills and a different way of interacting with each other”. The various departments that define the design and performance of the car, Allison says, need to work much more closely together than under the previous set of rules, under which Mercedes were so successful. “The car,” he says, “is just the outcome of the institutional approach to designing a car. Everything about being competitive is about valuing the right things, putting resource onto the right things and then pursuing those right things with vigour. The car just pops out at the end as a consequence of that.” Having realised what was important in making the car fast, and made the appropriate organisational changes, Mercedes have made remarkable progress. “Suddenly,” Wolff said, “everything that didn’t make sense, made sense and the results of the development direction is back in the old days.” They have been on pole at two of the last four races. Russell, who retired at Silverstone with a water leak, won in Austria a week ago, inheriting the lead when Verstappen and Norris collided and damaged their cars. At Silverstone, the Mercedes qualified one-two and were the fastest cars in the race, except when the track was wet, and even then the swing in performance was down to McLaren running more downforce. Hamilton said: “There's still a long, long way to go, but we are super close, and I think hopefully with the next upgrade perhaps, we will be in an even stronger position to really, really be fighting for the front row more consistently.” The next upgrade will come at the next race in Hungary, another of Hamilton’s favourite tracks, with another to follow in Belgium a week later. “We are finding performance and we are putting it on the car,” Wolff said. “And it translates into lap time and that wasn’t the case for the last two years. “There is more to come in terms of performance. We are bringing updates to Budapest and Spa but on the other side we mustn’t get carried away. We had a win last week benefiting from (Verstappen and Norris) tangling but today we have an honest win. “We had the real pace. You could see George and Lewis in the lead and almost under all conditions we were there.” Hamilton, pictured here with father Anthony, was emotional following his win Hamilton, Norris and the other leading drivers at Silverstone put on arguably the best race so far of a year that has completely shifted from the Red Bull domination of the first five races. In the end, Verstappen split Hamilton and Norris, but it could easily have been a British one-two, and either way around. Norris was leading going into the final pit stops, but the decision to stop for the final time a lap later than Hamilton and Verstappen, in addition to a delay caused by having to hold the car for the passing Ferrari of Carlos Sainz, put Hamilton in front. When the McLaren chewed through its soft tyres faster than the Mercedes, Verstappen was able to close in and take second. For McLaren and Norris, it was another “missed opportunity”, as team principal Andrea Stella put it, to add to others in Canada, Spain and Austria. Norris was very down on himself afterwards. “We threw it away at the final stop,” Norris said. “Even if we had boxed on the perfect lap, the decision to go on the softs was the wrong one. Lewis would still have won, so two calls from our side cost us. Stella said the team took responsibility for the pit calls. But Norris, at least after the race, was looking at himself. “I didn’t do a good enough job today with the calls,” he said, “So many things are good and in place, just not executing things the way I want and need to. “When you throw away a win, it is pretty disappointing. I am just not to the level I need to be at, not to the level of the others at the minute. It is something I need to work on.” This video can not be played Formula 1: McLaren’s Lando Norris explains what he loves about the British Grand Prix",2024-07-07 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cl5ywv730ezo,Andrew Benson,2024-07-07 21:10:29,
161,Djokovic 'expects fireworks' against Rune,"Novak Djokovic is aiming to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles Novak Djokovic says he expects ""fireworks on court"" when he takes on Holger Rune for a place in the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Monday. The 24-time Grand Slam champion is 16 years Rune's senior but doesn't underestimate the challenge the Dane will pose when they close proceedings on Centre Court. ""Rune's a spectacular player, no doubt. He loves the big stage, loves playing on grass. I think he's a very, very tricky opponent,"" said second seed Djokovic. The 37-year-old is going for an eighth Wimbledon title and record 25th Grand Slam overall. ""It's going to take my best tennis to win,"" he added. ""I actually get along very well with [Rune]. He's a very nice guy, always has been to me and to my team, and vice versa."" The pair have met five times previously, with Serb Djokovic winning on three occasions, including the two most recent, on hard courts in 2023. ""I always try to be available to him for any practice or advice or guidance or anything like that,"" said Djokovic. ""I think we have quite similar styles of tennis. But when it comes to playing on the court and competing, obviously we both have that fire. I'm sure that on Monday, we'll see a lot of fireworks on the court."" Following knee surgery just weeks before arriving at SW19, Djokovic is yet to win a match in straight sets at the All England Club but Rune said he still expects a ""tough battle"". ""I'm expecting nothing but a great level from him. I know he did his surgery, but honestly I practised with him in the first week, and I saw him playing a little bit,"" said the 15th seed.  ""He seems like he's playing very well, feeling confident."" Elsewhere on day eight of the Championships, American 13th seed Taylor Fritz will take on German fifth seed Alexander Zverev on Centre Court while Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur opens play on Court One against France's Arthur Fils. Kazakh fourth seed Elena Rybakina will open play on Centre Court against 17th seed Anna Kalinskaya with her sights fixed on the quarter-finals after a string of shock exits in the women's draw. After second seed Coco Gauff's straight-set defeat by fellow American Emma Navarro on Sunday, 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina is the last of the top five seeds still in the competition.

166,Children's hospital hit as Russian strikes kill dozens in Ukraine,"A children's hospital in Kyiv has been hit after Russia launched a wave of missile strikes against cities across Ukraine. Two people died when the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - sustained major damage during the blast.  Thirty-six people were killed and 140 people were injured in the strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Monday. Lesia Lysytsia, a doctor at the hospital, told the BBC the moment the missile struck was ""like in a film"" with a ""big light, then an awful sound"". ""One part of the hospital was destroyed and there was a fire in another. It's really very damaged - maybe 60-70% of the hospital,"" she said. Pictures from the scene showed young children - some with IV drips - sitting outside the hospital as it was evacuated. Vitaliy Klitschko, Kyiv's mayor, said the two who died at the hospital were adults - one of whom was a doctor. He added that rescuers feared more people were trapped under the rubble. Russia has denied targeting the hospital, saying it was hit by fragments of a Ukrainian air defence missile. But Ukraine says it has found remnants of a Russian cruise missile. Ohmatdyt is a major hospital which carries out cancer treatment and organ transplants. ""Now we are in the process of evacuating patients to the nearest hospital.. [but] many patients are intubated and on ventilators and cannot have contact with other patients or go outside,"" Dr Lysytsia said. Hospital officials told Ukrainian TV that about 20 children were being treated in the ward which was hit. Following the strike, Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina wore a black ribbon as a mark of respect when she played in the round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday afternoon. Mayor Klitschko accused Russia of attempting the ""genocide of [the] population in Ukraine"". ""Right now the whole world can see how Russian missiles and Kamikaze drones killed Ukrainian citizens in our peaceful city.  The mayor added that a separate maternity hospital in Kyiv's Dniprovsky district had also been partially destroyed by falling debris, killing seven people. Mr Zelensky wrote on social media that ""more than 40 missiles of different types"" had hit buildings and infrastructure in cities including Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. He called for a stronger Western response ""to the blow that Russia has once again delivered on our population, on our land, on our children"". Dnipro regional head Sergiy Lysak said one person was killed in Dnipro city and six more injured. He added that a high-rise building and a business had been hit. Three people were killed in Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken control of a number of villages in recent weeks. The Russian bombardment comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Moscow for a two-day state visit where he is due to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin. Russia, which has denied targeting civilian infrastructure, said the damage to the children's hospital was caused by a Ukrainian air defence missile. However, the Security Service of Ukraine has published pictures of what it says are fragments of a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile recovered from the site. Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov responded to the attacks by urging the country's allies to help quickly strengthen its air defences. ""Our defence capabilities are still insufficient... We need more air defence systems,"" he said. Ukraine's allies have condemned the attack on the Ohmatdyt hospital, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accusing Russia of ""ruthlessly targeting Ukrainian civilians"". New UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said ""we must hold those responsible for Putin's illegal war to account"". UN chief António Guterres strongly condemned the strikes, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, adding he found the attack on the children's hospital and another medical facility ""particularly shocking"". ""Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects is prohibited by international humanitarian law, and any such attacks are unacceptable and must end immediately,"" he said. The UN's human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has said civilian casualties have been mounting in recent months, as Russia renewed its air campaign. A recent report said May was the deadliest month for civilian deaths in almost a year.

167,Macron asks French PM to stay on as political deadlock continues," French President Emmanuel Macron has asked his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to remain in post ""for the time being to ensure the country's stability"", after election results left no party with an outright majority. Mr Attal, who led the president's Ensemble alliance's election campaign, handed his resignation to Mr Macron on Monday, only for the president to refuse. Although Ensemble lost many of its seats in Sunday's parliament election, it came second, behind a left-wing alliance but ahead of the far right which had been expected to win. The unexpected result leaves French politics in deadlock, with no party able to form a government by itself. The New Popular Front, a left-wing alliance cobbled together after Mr Macron called the elections, argues that as the leading group in the next National Assembly it has earned the right to choose a prime minister. They were due to meet on Monday to consider who to propose for the job, but there is no obvious candidate who would satisfy the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party as well as the more moderate Socialists, Greens and Communists. Mr Attal had announced he would resign on Sunday night, but left open the possibility of remaining in the job as long as duty required him to do so.  It had been widely expected that his resignation would be rejected when he visited the Élysée Palace on Monday morning. President Macron is due to fly to the US on Tuesday for a Nato summit and Paris is hosting the Olympic Games from 26 July.  While it is not yet clear how long he needs Mr Attal to stay in office, the president made it clear that France now needed a period of calm. Outgoing Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned on Monday that the country was facing an immediate risk of financial crisis and economic decline. Since the results came out, Mr Macron has sought to steer clear of the political fray. A statement on Sunday night said that while he would respect the ""choice of the French people"", he was waiting for the full picture to emerge in parliament before taking the next, necessary decisions. The National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella had been widely expected to win the election, after taking a strong lead in Sunday's first round.  But even though their vote held up, with more than 10 million people backing RN and a group of conservative allies, they failed to come anywhere near the number of seats suggested by opinion polls, They ended up with 143 seats, when they had set themselves the ambition of reaching an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. The party's two leaders had bitterly accused the left and centrist blocs of stitching up the vote, with more than 200 candidates dropping out to give a rival candidate a chance of defeating RN. But by Monday, Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were trying to look ahead. ""In just two years, progress has been incredible and makes victory for us inevitable in the short term,"" said Ms Le Pen, thanking the 10 million voters who backed RN and its allies. ""The number one party for numbers of votes and MPs."" Mr Bardella was determined to focus on his future role in the European Parliament. He is now going to lead a new grouping the European Parliament called Patriots for Europe, formed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Hungary has taken over the presidency of the EU this month, and already Mr Orban has angered several of his European counterparts by becoming the first EU leader to visit Russia's Vladimir Putin in more than two years. President Macron had called France's snap parliamentary vote in response to RN's victory in EU elections only a month ago.

177,'You're not welcome here': Australia’s treatment of disabled migrants,"When Luca was born in a Perth hospital two years ago, it flipped his parents’ world in ways they never expected. With the joy came a shocking diagnosis: Luca had cystic fibrosis. Then Australia - Laura Currie and her husband Dante’s home for eight years - said they couldn't stay permanently. Luca, his parents were told, could be a financial burden on the country. “I think I cried for like a week - I just feel really, really sorry for Luca,” Ms Currie says. “He's just a defenceless two-and-a-half-year-old and doesn't deserve to be discriminated against in that way.” With a third of its population born abroad, Australia has long seen itself as a “migration nation” - a multicultural home for immigrants that promises them a fair go and a fresh start. The idea is baked into its identity. But the reality is often different, especially for those who have a disability or a serious medical condition. It is one of few countries that routinely rejects immigrants’ visas on the basis of their medical needs - specifically if the cost of care exceeds A$86,000 ($57,000; £45,000) over a maximum of 10 years. New Zealand has a similar policy but Australia's is much stricter.  The government defends the law as necessary to curb government spending and protect citizens' access to healthcare. It says these visas aren’t technically rejected. But neither are they granted. Some can apply for a waiver, although not all visas allow it. They could also appeal the decision but the process is lengthy and expensive. Campaigners see this as discriminatory and out of step with modern attitudes towards disability. And after years of fighting for it, they are hoping for change in the coming weeks, with an official review of the health requirements under way. Laura Currie and Dante Vendittelli had moved from Scotland for jobs that Australia desperately needs. She is a nursery teacher and he is a painter-decorator. They had started their application for permanent residency before Luca was born. But now they feel like the life they built here and the taxes they paid meant little. “It's like, we're here for you [Australia] when you need us, but when the roles are reversed and we need you, it's like, nope, sorry, you cost too much money, you go back to your own country.” Australia has form when it comes to its strict immigration policies. It had its own version of “stop the boats”, which sent people arriving by boat to offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Island of Nauru and made controversial headlines in recent years. It was only in the 1970s that it entirely rid itself of the “White Australia” policy that started in 1901 with the Immigration Restriction Act, which limited the number of non-white immigrants. The disability and health discriminations, which also date back to 1901, are still in place, says Jan Gothard, an immigration lawyer: ""We still treat people with disability in the same way as we did in 1901 and we think they're not people who are welcome in Australia.” She is part of Welcoming Disability, an umbrella group that’s been pressuring the government to overhaul the law. Surprisingly, Australia's Migration Act is exempt from its own Disability Discrimination Act. Put simply, it doesn’t matter how long you’ve lived in Australia, if you were born in Australia, if you have private health insurance or even if you can pay for the support yourself - if you are deemed too much of a financial burden, you will fail the health requirement. The government says that 99% of visa applicants meet the health requirement - 1,779 of them did not meet the bar between 2021 and 2022, according to official figures. Immigration minister Andrew Giles, who declined to be interviewed, recently said that “any child born in Australia and adversely affected by the migration health rules can apply for ministerial intervention”, and that he himself had “positively intervened” in cases. But families say that the process is gruelling at an already difficult time. ""There's so much in your life going on when a child is sick, so much struggle and you're struggling and begging and asking for petitions, asking people to help you,” says Mehwish Qasim, who knows the challenge first-hand. She and her husband Qasim fought to stay in Australia in a case that drew global attention. Their son Shaffan was born in 2014 with a rare genetic condition and a damaged spinal cord. He needs around-the-clock care. The couple, originally from Pakistan, intended to return eventually, but Shaffan's birth changed everything. Now, getting on a plane would risk his life. Finally, in 2022 they were told they could stay. For those eight years, Qasim, a trained accountant, was unable to work in his chosen profession. Instead, he found jobs in cafes, in supermarkets and taxi apps to make ends meet. “They should realise that's a very difficult situation - you shouldn't put people in the limelight,” Ms Qasim says. Ms Currie and her husband aren’t giving up either - Australia is home now for Luca and they are filling jobs that the country needs. They’re hoping that is enough to win them their appeal. If they lose, they will have 28 days to leave the country. For Luca, the sticking point is a pricey drug, Trikafta. He is not on it and may not even be compatible with it. But it’s the basis of Australian estimates of his treatment - around A$1.8m That puts his medical costs over the permissible limit - A$86,000 over 10 years, also known as the Significant Cost Threshold. While campaigners have welcomed the recent rise of the threshold - from A$51,000 to A$86,000 - they still don’t think it reflects average costs. The government’s own data shows that Australia spent $9,365 per head on health goods and services in 2021-2022 and a further A$8,245 per person on welfare costs. Over a 10-year period - the maximum period assessed for a visa - that would amount to more than A$170,000. So campaigners have questioned how the government comes up with the threshold, which is half of that amount. They also want the cost of educational support to be removed from the calculations. This impacts families whose children have been diagnosed with conditions such as Down Syndrome, ADHD and autism. It’s a snag that has hit Claire Day’s plans for her and her family to follow her brother, who moved to Australia a few years ago. Her younger daughter Darcy, who is nearly 10, has Down Syndrome. She's been told by migration experts that because of that, she has little chance of being granted a visa. On an overcast afternoon in Kent, she talks wistfully of the life she is looking forward to Down Under. Sunshine is no small attraction, but also “the lifestyle - [I want] a better environment for the children to grow up in,” she says. An officer with London’s Metropolitan Police force for 21 years, she wants to take advantage of a major recruitment drive by Australian police forces. Their social media feeds are full of promotional videos fronted by former British police officers, showing them living the Australian dream, patrolling the beach in sand buggies and relaxing in the surf. They make up just some of the 30,000 British people who moved to Australia last year, according to government statistics. Ms Day has not one, but two job offers - from Queensland’s police force and from South Australia. As part of the job, she’s also entitled to a permanent visa. Now, she is not so sure. “I had hoped that it wouldn't be an issue because Darcy doesn't have any medical problems. She's fit and she's healthy, she goes to school and she participates in clubs and all of that sort of stuff.” Stories like this have convinced campaigners that, at its heart, the policy is ableist. “If we say to people with disability, ‘you’re not welcome here, we're saying directly to people living with disability in this country, ‘you’re not welcome here either,” Dr Gothard says.  ""[We're saying] you know, given the opportunity, we would rather not have you.” Social worker Shizleen Aishath says she was “gobsmacked” to find out about the health requirement - and she discovered it the hard way. A former UN employee, she came to Australia for a further degree with every intention of returning to the Maldives. But she had an emergency C-section when her son Kayban was born in 2016. Forceps were used during the delivery. Kayban had undiagnosed haemophilia and suffered a serious brain bleed. He now needs round-the-clock care and the family chose to stay in Australia. But Kayban was refused a temporary visa because he was deemed too much of a burden - although the family have private health insurance and don’t use state resources. The rest of the family were granted their visas. “Disability is the only thing that stops you from migrating, there is nothing else,” Ms Aishath says. After a lengthy appeal, Kayban was allowed to remain. His family is now preparing for their next fight - to stay in Australia indefinitely.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyr70ezev2mo,"Katy Watson,",2024-07-08 15:09:47,
182,What's the right punishment for 'too big to fail' Boeing?,"Boeing is one of the largest and most important companies in the United States. Arguably, it is too big to fail. But is it also too big to be held to account? The company is one of the world’s two main manufacturers of large commercial jets. It ranks among the top five US defence contractors. It employs more than 170,000 people globally, including 150,000 in the US, and generated revenues of nearly $78bn (£60bn) last year. It makes a vital contribution to the US economy. But its commitment to safety has repeatedly been called into question, most recently following an incident earlier this year in which a disused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max minutes after takeoff. Whistleblowers have since made a series of claims about alleged unsafe practices in Boeing’s factories, as well as in those of its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. Critics say the company has not taken its problems seriously - and that regulators, cowed by the firm's importance, are not taking the steps necessary to force Boeing to fix its problems.  A new deal for the firm has amplified those claims.  This week, the firm agreed to plead guilty to an existing criminal fraud charge,  which was brought after two near-identical crashes involving Boeing's brand new 737 Max, that occurred more than five years ago, killing 346 people. Family members of many of those killed have said the agreement, which will be submitted to a judge for approval, is far too lenient. ""The plea deal with Boeing unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons,"" their lawyer Paul Cassell wrote in a written objection to the deal. The deal stems from an investigation that started in 2019, after the second crash. Investigators later concluded that Boeing had cut corners during the design of its 737 Max, and deceived regulators. Boeing was accused of putting profits ahead of passenger safety.  In 2021, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.5bn settlement, but avoided prosecution on a criminal fraud conspiracy charge. But in May the Department of Justice (DoJ) found Boeing broke the terms of that settlement by not implementing and enforcing a suitable compliance and ethics programme. As part of its guilty plea, Boeing agreed to pay a $243.6m penalty and submit to independent monitoring for three years.  It also agreed that its board of directors would meet with victims' families and pledged to invest some $455m in safety improvements.  Erin Applebaum, a lawyer who represents 34 families who lost loved ones on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, said the deal was ""nothing more than a slap on the wrist and will do nothing to effectuate meaningful change within the company"".  The DoJ said the agreement did not preclude action against any individual executives or against the company for conduct that occurred after the 2018 and 2019 crashes.  But officials left some key questions - such as how the guilty plea would affect Boeing's ability to bid for government work - unanswered. In Washington, the agreement was greeted by some calls from lawmakers for further action. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has led hearings focused on Boeing's retaliation against whistleblowers said, individuals, not just the company, should face consequences ""for past illegalities as well as continuing retaliation against whistleblowers & other wrongdoing"". ""This plea deal cannot be the end of Boeing’s accountability,""  he wrote on social media. ""The need for ongoing aggressive investigative efforts and other action is obvious."" ""Regardless of the DOJ’s efforts, Congress must not let up on its own oversight of both Boeing and the FAA, and that is something I plan to continue to pursue,” Senator Tammy Duckworth added. Before the deal was announced, others had expressed concerns that Boeing was too important to be held fully accountable. ""I’ll go back to the reality of the fact that we all want Boeing to succeed,” Republican Senator Ron Johnson said at a hearing in April. “We don’t want to think that there are conditions in these planes that should really force regulators to ground these planes - what that would do to our economy, what that would do to people’s lives."" Analysts said there was little doubt Boeing’s status as a major contractor to the US military would have been a key factor in deciding what action to take against the company. In 2022 alone, it racked up more than $14bn worth of contracts with the Department of Defense. ""That may matter the most regarding not the direct terms of the plea, but rather the negotiations over possible debarment or suspension from contracting,"" said Prof Brandon Garrett of Duke University School of Law, who tracks corporate prosecutions. There is also Boeing’s position in the commercial aviation market to consider.  The crises have already taken a heavy toll on the company, which has lost money every year since 2019, a sum totalling more than $30bn. But the market currently needs Boeing if airlines are to obtain the planes they need.  The aerospace giant currently has orders for more than 6,000 jets, representing years of production. Its great rival Airbus has an even larger backlog, and has been struggling to produce enough planes to meet demand. In the future the company will also have to be in good shape if it is to see off the threat from an emerging rival. ""Boeing's too big to fail, but it's not too big to be mediocre,"" says Ronald Epstein, a managing director at Bank of America, who follows the firm. Chinese state-backed manufacturer Comac is now producing the C919 passenger jet, a potential rival to the 737 Max and Airbus A320 neo. It began commercial flights in May. Its order book is tiny compared to those of Airbus and Boeing but in the longer term it could profit from any weakness at the American giant. There is also potential for Brazil’s Embraer, a successful manufacturer for smaller regional airlines, to move into the space occupied by Boeing and Airbus. All of this may explain why the DoJ has not imposed steeper penalties on Boeing. Nevertheless, the company has admitted to a serious crime. That in itself is a major development. The question now is whether the DoJ has done enough to deter future wrongdoing.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2jeg14r9o,"Natalie Sherman and Theo Leggett,",2024-07-08 17:09:47,
181,Rewards for tourists who litter pick in Copenhagen,"Tourists will be rewarded with free food and activities if they participate in environmentally friendly tasks while visiting Copenhagen, the city's tourist board has announced. The trial scheme, which begins on 15 July, will see tourist attractions in the Danish capital offer rewards for activities such as litter-picking, travelling by public transport or biking around the city. Under the initiative, visitors can claim free lunches, coffees, glasses of wine and kayak rental in return for their work. The ""CopenPay"" scheme is designed to offset the ""environmental burden"" of tourism, according to the Copenhagen tourist board. ""When you travel abroad - if you fly to other places or you travel by car - you pollute,"" says the tourist board's communications chief Rikke Holm Petersen. ""One of the things we can change is getting people to act more sustainably at the destination."" The plan is only a ""little step towards the green transition"", Ms Petersen admits. The project is ""trust-based"", meaning attractions are unlikely to ask for proof that the green activity has been completed. ""In some attractions you might have to show a picture of you riding a bike, or of your public transportation ticket,"" she says.  The government is not reimbursing the companies behind the attractions - including museums, rooftop bars and kayaking charities - for participating in the scheme. So far 24 organisations have signed up to the pilot. Last year, Denmark recorded over 12 million overnight stays across the country, according to government statistics. Ms Petersen anticipates a ""small percentage"" of visitors to the city will participate in the trial, which runs until 11 August.  Othy Jasper, a 25-year-old Londoner who will be travelling to Copenhagen for work in August, said he is ""conscious"" of his air miles when he travels. ""It can really rack up - you have to think is it essential, is it worthwhile? Of everything one can do, catching flights is possibly the worst for pollution."" Speaking on the scheme, he says ""it's cool they're doing something for the climate"" but it would be unlikely he would spend time collecting litter in return for a reward. ""In terms of an incentive, it feels like a bit of an effort to do.""  If the scheme is judged to be a success it will be rolled out across the rest of the year. ""Imagine if we could have people taking a greener mindset back with them - if that was the souvenir they got - that would be amazing,"" Ms Petersen says.

180,Tate brothers accused of being serial tax evaders,"Controversial social media personality Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have been accused of failing to pay any tax on £21m of revenue from their online businesses. Devon and Cornwall Police is bringing a civil claim against the brothers and a third person, referred to only as J. They are accused of paying no tax in any country on their online business revenue between 2014 and 2022. The force is seeking to recover around £2.8 million in seven frozen bank accounts, an application the three defendants are contesting. ""Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate are serial tax and VAT evaders,"" Sarah Clarke KC for Devon and Cornwall Police told Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. ""They, in particular Andrew Tate, are brazen about it."" Ms Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: ""When I lived in England I refused to pay tax."" The court heard he said his approach was ""ignore, ignore, ignore because in the end they go away"". The court also heard that the brothers had ""a huge number of bank accounts"" in the UK, seven of which have been frozen. Ms Clarke said the money - from various products sold on websites including OnlyFans - had been “washed around” a huge number of UK bank accounts. As well as owning extensive land, property and vehicles in Romania, the Tates had spent their earnings on “fast cars and property”, Ms Clarke said. ""That's what tax evasion looks like, that's what money laundering looks like,"" she  told the court. The brothers are accused of paying just under $12m into an account in J's name, and opening a second account in her name, even though she had no role in their businesses, the court heard. Devon and Cornwall Police alleges that this was fraud by false misrepresentation. Ms Clarke said all three would not provide any evidence in the case. Money from the brothers' businesses including Cobra Tate, Hustlers' University and War Room was paid into the first account, held with payment service provider Stripe. It was opened in February 2019 in J's name with an incorrect date of birth, the court heard. Driving licences belonging to both Andrew Tate and J were later submitted to Stripe as proof of identity and address. The majority of payments out of this account went to one of Andrew Tate's accounts, the court heard. J also moved money through her own Revolut bank account, including one payment of £805,000, the court heard. Of this, £495,000 was paid to Andrew Tate, and £75,000 to an account in J's name that was later converted to cryptocurrency, it is alleged. The proceedings are civil, which uses a lower standard of proof than criminal cases. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring will decide on the balance of probabilities whether what the police claim is true. The case was adjourned until Tuesday. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views. In a separate case in Romania, the Tate brothers, former kickboxers who are dual UK-US nationals, are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the brothers in an indictment published in June last year, and seven alleged victims were identified. Andrew Tate has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence against him and there is a conspiracy to silence him. The internet personalities are also wanted in the UK over alleged sexual offences, which they deny.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjk3xglre0ko,"Callum May & George Wright,",2024-07-08 17:09:47,
179,Nobel laureate Alice Munro's daughter reveals family secret of abuse,"The youngest daughter of acclaimed Canadian Nobel laureate Alice Munro has said that her step-father sexually assaulted her as a child, and that her mother stayed with him even after learning of the abuse.  In an essay published in the Toronto Star on Sunday, Andrea Robin Skinner described how her step-father began assaulting her in the summer of 1976 when she was nine years old and he was in his 50s.  One evening, when Munro was away, he ""climbed into the bed where I was sleeping and sexually assaulted me"", Ms Skinner said.  Munro, who learned of the abuse years later, remained with him until his death in 2013.  The author, who died in May at the age of 92, is one of the most celebrated short-story writers in Canadian history. Her collections often focused on life in small-town Ontario where she was raised, earning praise for their nuanced portrayals of women and girls.  In the weekend essay, Ms Skinner and her siblings said they believed this dark family story must also be part of Munro's legacy. ""I never wanted to see another interview, biography or event that didn’t wrestle with the reality of what had happened to me, and with the fact that my mother, confronted with the truth of what had happened, chose to stay with, and protect, my abuser,"" she said.   In her weekend piece, Ms Skinner said she was first assaulted during a summer visit to her mother and step-father, Gerald Fremlin, in their home in Clinton, Ontario.  She later told her step-mother, who then told her father, Jim Munro, who decided not to confront Alice Munro at the time.  Ms Skinner returned to her mother's home the next year.  The step-mother, Carole, is quoted by The Star in a separate news story as saying: ""I told her she didn't have to go. But she wanted to spend time with her mother."" The BBC has reached out for comment Ms Skinner was initially relieved her father kept the family secret, she said, because of fears over how her mother would react.  ""She had told me that Fremlin liked me better than her, and I thought she would blame me if she ever found out,"" she wrote.  Over the next several years, during visits, the abuse continued.  Fremlin exposed himself to her during car rides, propositioned her for sex, and “told me about the little girls in the neighbourhood he liked"".  He lost interest when she became a teenager, Ms Skinner told The Star.  She said kept quiet about the abuse but in early adulthood found herself struggling at university and with her physical and mental health.  A few years later, in 1992, she revealed the abuse in a letter to her mother. She says Munro reacted as she had feared - ""as if she had learned of an infidelity"".  Fremlin, meanwhile, wrote his own letters at the time to the family - excerpts of which were published by The Star - in which he admitted the abuse but blamed Ms Skinner.  ""Andrea invaded my bedroom for sexual adventure,"" Fremlin wrote.  “If the worst comes to worst I intend to go public. I will make available for publication a number of photographs, notably some taken at my cabin near Ottawa which are extremely eloquent … one of Andrea in my underwear shorts,"" he said.  Amid the fallout, Alice Munro left Fremlin, staying at a flat she owned in British Columbia. But she returned to her husband after a few months and stayed with him for the rest of his life.  She said ""that our misogynistic culture was to blame if I expected her to deny her own needs, sacrifice for her children, and make up for the failings of men"", Ms Skinner wrote.  In 2005, Ms Skinner reported the abuse to Ontario police, presenting the letters written by Fremlin.  Police charged him with indecent assault. He pleaded guilty, but ""the silence continued"", Ms Skinner wrote, because of Munro's fame.  In a statement, Munro Books, founded by Alice and Jim Munro and now independently owned, said that it ""unequivocally supports"" Ms Skinner's decision to tell her story publicly.  In a separate statement released by the Canadian bookstore, the Munro siblings said that the store's decision to  acknowledge ""Andrea’s truth, and being very clear about their wish to end the legacy of silence, the current store owners have become part of our family’s healing"".

178,After France's election shock comes the real power struggle,"The drama and vitriol of France’s sudden summer election is over. Now comes the drama and vitriol of stage two - and what could be a much longer and equally agitated struggle to build a functional coalition out of the inconclusive results of Saturday’s vote. “A lot of things are unclear. We know who lost but we don’t know who won. Can we learn the art of compromise which is so unusual for us? Nobody knows - the signs are not necessarily good,” Sylvie Kauffmann, a newspaper columnist for Le Monde, told me. The risks of deadlock – for France itself, for its constitutional order, for European stability, and even for Ukraine’s war against Russian aggression – are serious. But it’s worth remembering that this country is no stranger to coping with political upheavals. Revolutions aside, there was the chaos and revolts that followed World War Two and eventually upended France’s constitutional order, leading to the current system of government, known as the Fifth Republic. And more recently there were the challenges of “cohabitation”, when presidents and prime ministers from rival parties were obliged to share power. As politicians now sidle away for their summer holidays, or refocus their attention on the imminent Paris Olympics, it seems more than likely that the political temperature in France will subside by a degree or two, at least briefly. But the cohabitation battles of the 1980s and 1990s look like gentlemanly squabbles over a wine menu compared with the furious, guillotines-at-dawn brawls that many observers expect to preoccupy France’s National Assembly for weeks, or even months, to come. Some wonder if the French electorate – by saddling parliament with three minority blocks of almost equal size – has rendered the country “ungovernable,” or whether it is simply faced with the sort of deal-making challenge that so many other European nations wrestle with almost as a matter of course. Having emerged, to almost universal surprise, with the most seats at this parliamentary election, France’s left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NPF) has now earned the right to pick – or try to pick - the next prime minister and to implement its agenda. But with no working majority, any viable candidate will need to win support from other, more centrist parties. Who could possibly fit that bill? The NPF was quick to unite around a common platform ahead of the elections. But it contains deep political rifts – stretching as it does from anti-capitalists and communists to mainstream social democrats. The coalition is also home to some divisive figures, like the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who could quickly trigger the coalition’s collapse over the factionalism that has often marked the left of French politics. Some wonder if the Green Party leader, Marine Tondelier, might be a good fit. Her relatively low profile could be an asset in a political landscape scarred by years of deeply personal, and sometimes vitriolic, feuding. In the midst of this, President Emmanuel Macron remains on his throne, scarred by self-inflicted political wounds, but arguably a little stronger than he was a few days ago. His centrist grouping lost almost a third of its seats in the National Assembly as a result of his entirely unnecessary electoral gamble to dissolve parliament and call elections. But a disciplined frenzy of deal-making with the NPF helped it cling onto many more seats in the second round than the pollsters predicted. Could deadlock in parliament enable Mr Macron to float above the chaos and strengthen his position? Even his allies seem sceptical, convinced he is now trapped in a “stranglehold” between the extremes he once promised to banish from French political life. “Today, the President of the Republic will maintain a small margin of manoeuvre to act. But he will no longer be the political programmatic driving force in the country. From this point of view, after seven years, Macronism is dead,” Gilles Legendre, a disillusioned former MP who used to lead Macron’s party in the Assembly, told the BBC. As for the far-right National Rally (RN), it will no doubt recover quickly from the shock of Sunday night’s results, which prompted sombre silence at the party’s headquarters - a jarring contrast with the euphoric street celebrations by left-wing voters which swept through parts of Paris that same evening. The RN has already sought to reframe its third-place disappointment as the result of cynical deal-making by a “dishonest alliance” of its rivals, rather than evidence of its own shallow pool of credible candidates and its failure to convince enough French voters of the sincerity of its move away from the extreme right. The RN will surely try to promote its own agenda – including a clampdown on immigration and reforms of schools and policing. Its commitment to supporting Ukraine remains unclear, given the party’s recent support for the Kremlin and its occupation of Crimea. The RN must now be hoping that the Assembly is either deadlocked or dominated by an economically profligate far-left agenda that could further threaten France’s already strained budget. Months, or even years, of turmoil could then give the party a chance to portray itself as a stable and modernising force, thwarted by left-wing extremists and old elites. That in turn could, potentially, give the RN a good chance of increasing its vote share in any subsequent snap parliamentary election, or – and this is the real prize – sweeping its leader Marine Le Pen into the Presidency in 2027.

176,How fetching water is holding back India's women,"Fetching drinking water is a gruelling daily routine for millions of women in India. Even without enduring the scorching summer months or the freezing winters, they walk for miles every day, balancing plastic or earthen pots on their heads and carrying buckets in their hands to manage the household water stock. “It’s a daily struggle. I get so tired that I collapse when I’m done,” says Sunita Bhurbade from Tringalwadi, a tribal village 180km (112 miles) from India’s financial hub, Mumbai. Ms Bhurbade spends four-to-five hours every day travelling back and forth from her nearest reliable water source - a dry lake - to fill her pots. The water is dirty and she has to dig holes on the side for the water to filter through naturally and seep in. “For four-to-five months every year, women have no option but to fetch water from long distances because nearby wells and water sources dry up,” she says. Ironically, her village receives one of the heaviest rainfalls in the region. Because of this daily grind, she constantly complains of back and neck pain, fatigue and weakness. The daily rigour also bars her and other women from her village from pursing a paid job. “No-one will hire me even as a farm labourer because they won’t allow me to show up at work in the afternoon,” she says. ""If I go after water, I have to sacrifice my livelihood. If I try to earn a wage, my family stays thirsty.” According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef, 1.8 billion people worldwide collect drinking water from supplies located off premises, and in seven out of 10 households, women and girls are primarily responsible for water collection. This is particularly true in India where, experts say, the need to secure drinking water is holding women back and hindering economic growth. “First, women can’t take up paid work because they have to do all the household chores and secondly, even if they wish to find some work after doing their daily chores, there are not enough paid jobs for women in rural India,"" says Prof Ashwini Deshpande, who heads the economics department in Delhi's Ashoka University. The value of women’s unpaid labour in Indian economy is huge. India’s largest commercial bank State Bank of India (SBI)’s Ecowrap report indicates that the total contribution of unpaid women's work to the economy is around 22.7bn rupees ($276.8m; £216.7m), almost 7.5% of India’s total GDP. The NGO International Development Organisation estimates that Indian women spend 150 million work days every year fetching water. Experts say that if women can spend this time in paid activities, they can be financially independent and it can also boost the economy. The Indian government says it is constantly working to improve water infrastructure countrywide. By January 2024, it said it had provided piped water to almost 74% of rural households. For those who had to earlier fetch water from outside but are now getting piped water in their homes, the experience has been life-changing. “I open the tap, water comes rushing… it’s like a dream. I had been fetching water since I was five,” says Mangal Khadke, who’s married and in her 30s and lives about 30km from Ms Bhurbade. But there are still millions who lack access to tap water.  Around 700km away from Tringalwadi, in the Aaki village of central India’s Amaravati district,  village head Indrayani Javarkar spends most of her day finding and collecting water. “It’s so dry here in the summer that every day I wake up with one thought in my mind: where can I find water today?” she says.

170,One dead after lake electrocution in Virginia,"One man died and two others were injured after they were electrocuted at a lake in Virginia last week.  The incident happened Thursday at Smith Mountain Lake in Huddelston, Virginia.  Officials say the man who died, 18-year-old Jesse Hamric, was electrocuted by stray voltage at a dock as he tried to swim.  Mr Hamric reportedly jumped into the water, which shocked him. Two people who saw him were also shocked when they tried to help.  The Smith Mountain Lake Marine Fire and Rescue Department responded to an area marina for reports of a drowning at a dock.  They transported Mr Hamric to an area hospital where he died from his injuries.  Officials later confirmed electricity was found in the water. Emergency responders said they do not believe foul play was involved. The dock where the incident took place is located at a private residence, according to local media.  Mr Hamric, of Colorado, was said to be visiting friends with his family when the incident happened.  His exact cause of death has not yet been determined and the incident remains under investigation.

174,White House fights back against doubts on Biden fitness,"The White House has fought back against questions about Joe Biden’s mental fitness, with the US president telling anxious fellow Democrats it is time to end the criticism, and daring doubters in the party to challenge him. In a tense news conference, the president's spokeswoman rejected suggestions that he might be suffering from an undisclosed illness. Mr Biden, 81, himself took the unusual step of calling in to MSNBC's morning show, saying: ""I am not going anywhere."" Questions about the president's mental acuity have intensified since a poor debate performance against Donald Trump on 27 June. And the scrutiny is unlikely to fade this week as he hosts a summit in Washington for leaders of Nato countries. In Monday's daily press conference, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre rejected speculation that Mr Biden was being treated for Parkinson's disease, which can cause stiff movement and slurred speech. ""Has the president been treated for Parkinson's?"" she said. ""No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No."" An expert on Parkinson's disease from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington DC has visited the White House eight times since last year, the New York Times reports. But White House records show the same doctor also made a number of visits during the Obama administration from 2012-16. Ms Jean-Pierre would not comment on the matter, citing the need to protect the privacy of the doctor and security reasons. On Monday, the president called in to left-leaning MSNBC's Morning Joe programme, laying down the gauntlet to critics to “challenge me at the convention” next month, or rally behind him against Trump. In a letter sent to congressional Democrats also on Monday, Mr Biden said he ""wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe"" that he could beat Trump, the Republican challenger in November's election. Mr Biden's letter said he had ""heard the concerns that people have"" and ""is not blind to them"", but that Democratic voters in the primaries have ""spoken clearly and decisively"" that he should be the party's nominee. ""Do we now just say this process didn't matter?"" the letter said. ""That the voters don't have a say... I decline to do that. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.""  It comes a day after the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, held a group call in which four congressmen were explicit in urging Mr Biden to step aside, according to US news outlets.  The quartet was joined by others who voiced concerns about Mr Biden's fitness for office after his stumbling debate performance, but stopped short of asking for the president to exit the race. Jerry Nadler of New York, Mark Takano of California and Adam Smith of Washington state all said Mr Biden should step aside, according to multiple outlets, citing people on the call or those familiar with what was said. Joe Morelle of New York added his voice, according to CBS and the New York Times, but the Associated Press said the fourth person was Jim Himes. On Monday, Mr Smith publicly called for Mr Biden to quit, saying in a statement ""the American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as president"". Others on the call expressed concern about Mr Biden's electoral chances against Trump. Last week, Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first Democrat in Congress to urge Mr Biden to step aside. Trump, 78, has ridiculed Mr Biden over the debate, last week labelling his rival ""broken-down"". Biden allies have expressed exasperation about the media criticism he is facing, while his Republican challenger was recently convicted in a New York hush-money case. Amid mounting speculation over Mr Biden's candidacy in November, the thoughts of some Democrats have turned to who could replace him.  Some party members have rallied around Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is Mr Biden's running mate in November.  Trump has suggested the vice-president would be ""better"" than Mr Biden, but still ""pathetic"". During a pair of interviews last week, Mr Biden acknowledged that he had ""screwed up"" the debate, but later vowed that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could convince him to end his bid to win the White House again.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2q0x3ekeezo,"Bernd Debusmann Jr, at the White House,",2024-07-08 22:09:47,
173,Justin Bieber performs at India's mega wedding,"Justin Bieber has become the latest in a string of international stars to perform for the son of India's richest man and his wife-to-be as they celebrate their upcoming wedding. The Canadian singer flew in to perform for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant - along with their guests - in Mumbai at the weekend. He had a lot to live up to. The couple's first pre-wedding party featured Rihanna, while the second - a cruise around the Mediterranean - had performances from 90s teen heartthrobs The Backstreet Boys, singer Katy Perry and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. So it is with bated breath that Ambani wedding-watchers - of whom there are now legions around the globe - await news of who will perform at the actual wedding itself this weekend. Rumours swirling on the internet suggest it could be Adele, but the family are remaining tight-lipped. No expense is being spared on the wedding of Mukesh Ambani's youngest son, putting it in a different league from even the most extravagant of Indian weddings. It outshines even his daughter’s nuptials, which featured a headline-grabbing performance by Beyoncé. Last weekend Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant celebrated their sangeet ceremony - a night of music and dance ahead of the wedding ceremony. In typical style, the Ambanis went above and beyond what would usually be expected by guests. It saw Mukesh Ambani, the head of Reliance Industries, with an estimated net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes, and the rest of the family take to the stage in their own choreographed dance to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s hit song, Deewangi Deewangi.  It was also another chance for wedding-watchers to pore over the outfits worn by the guests - which included some of India's most glamorous stars wearing dresses by the country’s top fashion designers.  It seems as much as the pre-wedding events have been concerts, they have also become catwalks, with stars sharing professional shots on their social media accounts ahead of the parties. The cost of the three parties to date is not known. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Justin Bieber is said to be $10m. Exactly what the weekend's three-day event holds remains to be seen. For some in India, it will come as a relief that the wedding and its extravagance is over, while those in Mumbai will be hoping it does not make the city’s famously bad traffic any worse. Radhika was keeping her cards close to her chest when she told Vogue US last month that planning was ""going great"", adding: ""I’m very excited to be married.""",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1de8gzevpo,"Flora Drury,",2024-07-08 19:09:47,
172,Two dead as Beryl slams Texas leaving millions without power,"At least two people have died as Hurricane Beryl slammed into southeast Texas, knocking out power for more than two million people while bringing heavy rain and fierce wind gusts. When Beryl first hit Texas on Monday morning, it landed as a category one hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm. Officials have warned of destructive winds, up to 15in (38cm) of rain and ""life-threatening"" storm surges. More than 1,300 flights at Houston's largest airport have been cancelled. The state governor’s office has repeatedly urged residents not to underestimate the storm, which caused at least 10 deaths in the Caribbean days before. In Texas, a 53-year-old man died after ripping winds downed powerlines and knocked a tree onto his home in Harris County, causing his roof to collapse.  In the same county, which includes parts of Houston, a 74-year-old woman was also reported dead after a tree crashed through the roof of her home. The police were notified by the woman's granddaughter.  On Monday, police in one Houston suburb had already begun conducting water rescues as the hurricane continued to pound the state. According to US forecaster AccuWeather, landfalling hurricanes of this kind are somewhat rare for Texas in July. Houston is a low-lying coastal city, making it prone to flooding.  Sustained wind speeds in the Houston area had reached 75mph (120km/h) with wind gusts reaching 87mph (140km/h). Torrential rainfall and flash flooding have also occurred in areas where inches of rain fell in just a few hours.  The storm is expected to lose strength as it gradually tracks north-northeast but flash flooding and heavy rain remains a risk. More than 2.7 million customers in Texas are without power as of Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. At Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston's largest airport, 1,097 flights were cancelled, according to flightaware.com.  As the storm barrelled its way past Houston, tornado warnings were issued for dozens of other Texas counties in its path, including a few counties in Louisiana.  ""Take cover now!"" the National Weather Service warned in all caps in its weather update around 13:00 CDT (19:00 BST) for residents in Louisiana's Northeastern Beauregard Parish. ""Move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows."" Earlier, the city of Galveston, south-east of Houston, issued a voluntary evacuation order for some areas. Storm surges in the Galveston area were predicted to reach 4-6ft above ground.  In Surfside Beach, police posted a photo of flood waters rising above the lower part of a truck's door, feet above the ground.  The director of the US National Hurricane Center, Michael Brennan, has warned those living in Beryl's path to find a safe place to be through Monday ""as hazardous conditions will persist even after the centre of Beryl moves through"". ""There's a very considerable risk of flash flooding across the Texas Gulf Coast, eastern Texas, ArkaTex [Arkansas-Texas] region. ""Do not ignore this very serious storm,"" urged Acting Governor Dan Patrick.  The ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Freeport and Texas City have all closed, meaning there could be a temporary halt to exports.  All vessel movement and cargo operations have been restricted.  Refugio County, north of Galveston, on Saturday issued a mandatory evacuation - stating the limited capacity of emergency services staff, 4 July holiday traffic and the area's weakened infrastructure from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as reasons.  Nueces County, meanwhile, ordered the mandatory evacuation of visitors and strongly encouraged locals to leave as well.  More than 2,000 emergency responders have been made ready to deal with Beryl's  aftermath, Mr Patrick announced, including members of the Texas National Guard.  Beryl is expected to move east across America's central states, including Mississippi, later in the week.  In the process, it will likely skip over central and west Texas, areas that are currently experiencing moderate to severe levels of drought.  Hurricane Beryl has been an unprecedented storm. At one stage, it became the earliest Category Five hurricane ever recorded. It has already left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean - hitting islands including St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union, and Grenada especially hard. The storm was also one of the most powerful to ever hit Jamaica and left hundreds of thousands of people without power. Beryl brought heavy rain to the tourist hotspots of Cancún and Tulum in southern Mexico. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages. While it is difficult to attribute specific storms to climate change as the causes are complex, exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful. It is the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season but the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y49gwln0o,"Kathryn Armstrong and Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-08 21:09:47,
171,Accused of witchcraft then murdered for land,"BBC Africa Eye investigates a shocking spate of elderly people accused of witchcraft then murdered along Kenya’s Kilifi coast, and discovers the true motives behind the killings. Seventy-four-year-old Tambala Jefwa stares vacantly out of his one remaining eye as his wife, Sidi, gently removes his shirt. “They stabbed him with a knife like this and pulled,” she says pointing to the long scar stretching down from his collar bone. She takes his head in her hands showing what happened in another attack. “They had to pull the scalp back and sew it together.” Mr Jefwa was accused of being a witch and has been attacked twice in his home, 80km (50 miles) inland from the coastal town of Malindi. The first left him without an eye. The second nearly killed him. The couple own more than 30 acres of land where they grow maize and raise a few chickens. There has been a dispute with family members over boundaries. They believe this was the real reason Mr Jefwa was almost killed, not that people genuinely believed he was a witch. “I was left for dead. I lost so much blood. I don’t know why they attacked me, but it can only be the land,” says Mr Jefwa. Belief in witchcraft and superstition is common in many countries. But in parts of Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and South Africa, it can be used to justify killing elderly people to take their land. A report called, The Aged, on Edge, by Kenyan human rights organisation Haki Yetu says one elderly person is murdered along the Kilifi coast every week in the name of witchcraft. Its programme officer, Julius Wanyama, says many families believe it is one of their own who orders the killing. “They use the word witchcraft as a justification because they will get public sympathy. And people will say: ‘If he was a witch, it is good you have killed him.’” Few people in this region have title deeds for their land. Without a will, they rely on passing it down customarily through the family. Mr Wanyama says seven out of 10 of the killings are elderly men because land ownership and inheritance lie with them. “Historically people here in Kilifi do not have [land] documentation. The only document they have is the narrative from these elderly people. That is why mostly men are being killed, because once you kill them, then you have removed the obstacle,” says Mr Wanyama. About an hour’s drive from the Jefwa family land is a rescue centre for the elderly run by the charity, Malindi District Association. It is home to around 30 elderly people who have been attacked and are unable to go back to their own land. Sixty-three-year-old Katana Chara, who looks much older than his years, has been here for around 12 months. He had to move to the centre after he was attacked with a machete in his bedroom in April 2023. One hand was cut off at the wrist, the other just above the elbow. He can no longer work and needs help for the most basic tasks, from feeding and washing to dressing himself. “I know the person who cut my hands, but we have never met face to face since,” he says. Mr Chara was accused of being a witch over the death of another man’s child, but believes the real reason he was attacked was because of his six acres of land. “I don’t have anything to do with witchcraft. I have one piece of land and it is at the seafront. It is a big piece of land.” Many of Mr Chara’s family members were questioned over the attack but no-one was ever prosecuted. Activist Mr Wanyama has been trying to get justice for him. “Very few people have been charged on the allegations of killings of elderly. And that’s why I think even the key people who are involved in killing, they feel they are free.” After months of investigating, BBC Africa Eye managed to track down an ex-hitman who claims to have killed around 20 people. He says the minimum he got paid for each murder was 50,000 Kenyan shillings – around $400 (£310). “If someone kills an old person, know that their family paid for it. It must be their family,” he tells BBC Africa Eye. Pushed on how and why he thought it was his right to take someone’s life, he responds: “I may have done something bad because I was given the job and it is me that killed, but according to laws, according to God, the person who sent me is the guilty one.” The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights presented a document to the United Nations in February 2023 stating: “Witch burning, killings, and physical attacks are rife in regions such as Kisii in western Kenya and Kilifi county in coastal Kenya.”  It went on to say that younger family members seeking to acquire family land is a key motivating factor behind the killings. It said the attacks and killings increased during periods of drought and famine when sources of income become scarce. Mr Wanyama says killings which use accusations of witchcraft to justify land grabs have become a “national disaster” “It started as a regional issue, but now it has escalated... If we don’t address it, then we are losing our archives of the elderly. Those are the only live archives we can believe.” In traditional African culture, the elderly are revered for their wisdom and knowledge.  In Kilifi, it is the reverse. Old people are so fearful of becoming a target, many dye their hair in an attempt to look younger. It is rare for someone in this region to survive after being accused of witchcraft. While Mr Chara is safe now he lives at the rescue centre for the elderly, for men like Mr Jefwa there is real fear that whoever tried to murder him will come back.

175,Masoud Pezeshkian: The reformist former heart surgeon now Iran's president-elect,"Wildcard candidate Masoud Pezeshkian will become Iran's first reformist president in almost two decades, after he defeated hardliner Saeed Jalili in a run-off election on Friday. The 69-year-old former heart surgeon and health minister campaigned on promises to moderate Iran’s conservative outlook and improve relations with the West. He criticised the country’s notorious morality police and called for negotiations over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal. But analysts remain sceptical about his ability to enact meaningful change within an establishment dominated by ultraconservatives. When Mr Pezeshkian's name was confirmed on the ballot four weeks ago, following the death of hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, even his most loyal supporters were shocked that he had made it past the Guardian Council.  The powerful body of clerics and jurists which vets candidates' religious and revolutionary credentials had barred many prominent reformists and moderates from standing in recent elections, including Mr Pezeshkian himself for the last presidential poll in 2021. But once his candidacy was approved this time, Mr Pezeshkian carefully balanced promises of change with declarations of loyalty to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority in the country. In a celebratory speech, he praised the ""guidance"" of Ayatollah Khamenei, saying he would not have been able to succeed without him. With Iran facing a struggling economy, a shadow-war with Israel that burst into the open earlier this year, and continuing discontent over the violent crackdown on the women-led protests that erupted in 2022, the fact that Mr Pezeshkian was even allowed to stand could be a sign that the Supreme Leader wishes to soften the government's stance on certain issues. Masoud Pezeshkian was born in 1954 in the city of Mahabad, in the north-western province of West Azerbaijan. He is of mixed Azeri-Kurdish ancestry and grew up speaking both languages, giving him broad appeal among the ethnic minority groups which make up more than a third of Iran’s population of 89 million. He studied medicine in the years before the 1979 Islamic revolution - and as a fresh-faced doctor he organised medical assistance for wounded soldiers during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. He specialized in cardiac surgery after the conflict. In 1994, Mr Pezeshkian faced personal tragedy when his wife and son were killed in a car crash. He chose not to remarry, raising his daughter and two remaining sons alone - a story he told along the campaign trail, promising supporters: “As I was loyal to my family, I will be loyal to you.” He rose up the political ranks in the early 2000s, serving as health minister during the second term of reformist President Mohammad Khatami’s government between 2001 and 2005. He has represented the north-western city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008 and was a deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020. After a crackdown on the unrest that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election, Mr Pezeshkian drew attention for his criticism of the government's treatment of protesters, which spurred a backlash from Iran’s hard-line politicians. Mr Pezeshkian's candidacy in this year's presidential election was backed by major reformist groups and endorsed by Mr Khatami, as well as the moderate former president Hassan Rouhani. He finished narrowly ahead of Saeed Jalili in the election's first round, for which turnout was a record low of 40% amid calls for a boycott from opponents of the clerical establishment.  Turnout was almost 10 percentage points higher for the run-off, in which Mr Pezeshkian received 53.7% of the votes cast. In a post on X following his victory, Mr Pezeshkian told Iranians that it marked the beginning of a ""partnership"".  ""The difficult path ahead cannot be smoothed without your co-operation, sympathy and trust. I extend my hand to you and swear by my honour I will not leave you alone in this course. Do not leave me alone,"" he wrote. Although Mr Pezeshkian is considered to be a reformist, he often emphasises his devotion to the Supreme Leader. He has described himself as a ""reformist principlist"" and said: ""I am a principlist, and it is for these principles that we seek reform."" In the context of Iranian politics, ""principlist"" refers to conservative supporters of the Supreme Leader who advocate for protecting the ideological principles of the 1979 revolution's early days. Observers believe that it will be Mr Pezeshkian's ability to straddle reformist and principlist agendas that will be crucial to his success.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmm25dq14j3o,"Tom Bennett & BBC Persian,",2024-07-08 17:09:47,
169,Anchorman actor pleads guilty over Capitol riot,"Comedian Jay Johnston, best known for his work in the animated hit Bob's Burgers, has pleaded guilty over his involvement in the 6 January US Capitol riot. Mr Johnston admitted on Monday to a single count of obstructing officers during a civil disorder. He will be sentenced in October and faces up to five years in federal prison. More than 540 Capitol riot participants have served time behind bars. Mr Johnston, 55, has acting credits in Hollywood going back to the mid-1990s. He acted and wrote for all four season of HBO's Mr Show with Bob and David, starred in all three seasons of Comedy Central's The Sarah Silverman Program, and had a recurring role on the Fox sitcom Arrested Development. The Illinois native has also appeared in movies such as Anchorman and Men in Black II. Internet sleuths identified him as a participant in the 6 January riot from a social media post by the FBI in March 2021. Authorities have said he ""participated with other rioters in a group assault"" on police officers protecting a Capitol entrance and ""helped carry a stolen police riot shield out"". According to court documents, Mr Johnson also admitted to an acquaintance by text message that he had been there. “The news has presented it as an attack. It actually wasn’t,"" he wrote.  ""Thought it kind of turned into that. It was a mess. Got maced and tear gassed and I found it quite untastic.” That December, amid the allegations, Mr Johnston was fired from Bob's Burgers. He voiced fan-favourite character Italian restaurateur Jimmy Pesto. The character was recast in 2023 and returned to the show for its latest season. Mr Johnston was arrested in California last summer and initially charged on four counts. His plea agreement saw him admit to a single civil disorder charge while the other three offences were dropped. His sentencing hearing is set for 7 October. Nearly 1,500 people have been charged over their role in the violence that unfolded in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, according to the justice department. Of those individuals, more than 800 have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from assaulting law enforcement to seditious conspiracy.",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yqv84x4ko,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-08 18:09:47,
168,'I had to downgrade my life' - US workers in debt to buy groceries,"Stacey Ellis, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania, should be the kind of voter that US President Joe Biden can count on. But after four years of rising prices, her support has worn thin – and every time she shops at the supermarket, she is reminded how things have changed for the worse. Ms Ellis works full-time as a nurse’s assistant and has a second part-time job. But she needs to economise. She has switched stores, cut out brand-name items like Dove soap and Stroehmann bread, and all but said goodbye to her favourite Chick-fil-A sandwich. Still, Ms Ellis has sometimes turned to risky payday loans (short-term borrowing with high interest rates) as she grapples with grocery prices that have surged 25% since Mr Biden entered office in January 2021. ""Prior to inflation,"" she says, ""I didn't have any debt, I didn't have any credit cards, never applied for like a payday loan or any of those things. But since inflation, I needed to do all those things....I’ve had to downgrade my life completely."" The leap in grocery prices has outpaced the historic 20% rise in living costs that followed the pandemic, squeezing households around the country and fuelling widespread economic and political discontent. ""I’m a Democrat,"" says Ms Ellis, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown. ""I love voting for them. But Republicans are speaking volumes right now and Democrats are whispering."" “I want somebody to help me, help the American people,"" she adds. “Joe Biden, where are you?” For the president, already contending with serious doubts about his age and fitness for another term, the cost-of-living issue presents a major challenge, threatening to dampen turnout among supporters in an election that could be decided, like the last two, by several tens of thousands of votes in a handful key states.  Across the country, Americans on average spent more than 11% of their incomes on food, including restaurant meals last year – a higher proportion than any time since 1991. The jump in food prices has hit younger, lower-income and minority households -  key parts of the coalition that helped Mr Biden win the White House in 2020 - especially hard. But worries about the issue are widespread: a Pew survey earlier this year found that 94% of Americans were at least somewhat concerned about rising food and consumer goods prices. That was nearly identical to two years earlier, even though the staggering jumps in food prices that hit the US and other countries after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine have subsided. Dylan Garcia, a 26-year-old security guard from Brooklyn, says he’s never struggled to buy groceries as much as he has now. Instead of the fresh food and brand-name items he used to enjoy, he now stocks up on ramen noodles and frozen vegetables - and only eats twice a day because he can't afford more. At checkout, he routinely uses ""buy now, pay later” schemes, which allow him to pay the bill in installments, but have led to mounting debt. “I’m stuck in a loop,” he says. “It’s become an insecurity to pull up my phone at the register and have to use these programmes. When they see me, it’s embarrassing.” Mr Garcia, who has long voted for Democrats, says his precarious financial situation has made him lose hope in politics and he does not plan to vote in November's election. “I don’t think the government has our best interest and I don’t think they care,” he says. The White House maintains Mr Biden has been engaged on issues of food affordability, fighting to increase food stamp benefits and other government aid, initiatives opposed by Republicans.  At last month's presidential debate, the first question was on inflation, and Mr Biden sought to shift blame to big companies, accusing them of price gouging – a claim that is hotly disputed among economists. But despite strong job creation and low unemployment, opinion polls show voters continue to trust Mr Biden's opponent, former President Donald Trump, more on economic issues. On the CNN debate stage, the Republican White House candidate blamed Mr Biden for stoking inflation, which the White House denies, and said: “It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can’t.” The Trump campaign in turn denies that policies he proposes - including a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the US - would worsen price rises, as many analysts predict.  ""We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the US's economic standing in the world, and a destabilizing effect on the US's domestic economy,"" wrote 16 Nobel prize-winning economists in an open letter last month. Republicans have accused Mr Biden of trying to mislead the public about the extent of the inflation problem, noting that Mr Biden has claimed, incorrectly, that inflation was already at 9% when he entered office. It was 1.4%. Katie Walsh, a makeup artist in Pennsylvania, voted for Trump in 2020 and says she plans to do so again, based on his economic record. The 39-year-old says her family has struggled to keep up with inflation, especially since her business has slowed, as people squeezed by higher prices cut back. ""I know he's a big fat mouth,"" she says of Mr Trump. ""But he at least knows how to run the economy."" Analysts say it is clear that the economy is important to voters, but less clear it will prove decisive in the November election. In 2022, when inflation was at its worst, Democrats did better than expected in mid-term elections, as concerns about abortion access drove supporters to the polls.  This time around, issues such as immigration and fitness for office are also top of many voters' minds, while economic trends appear to be moving in the right direction. Grocery prices were up just 1% over the past 12 months, well within historic norms; and the cost of a few items, including rice, fish, apples, potatoes, and milk, has even come down a bit. As major chains such as Target, Amazon and Walmart announce price cuts in recent weeks, there are signs the situation could continue to improve. Some analysts also expect wages, which have increased but trailed the leap in overall prices, to finally catch up this year, providing further relief. “We’re on the right track,” says Sarah Foster, who follows the economy for  Bankrate.com. “Wage growth has slowed, price growth has slowed but, you know, prices are slowing at a much faster rate than wages.” Stephen Lemelin, a 49-year-old father of two from Michigan, another electoral battleground, says he was pleasantly surprised by lower prices on a recent supermarket trip. Whatever his concerns about the economy, the military veteran says his support for Mr Biden, who got his vote in 2020, has never been in doubt, given that he sees Trump as a threat to democracy. “Nobody likes high interest rates or high inflation but that’s not under presidential control,” he says. “If you know politics, there’s really only one choice.”",2024-07-08 23:09:47,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx002795738o,"Natalie Sherman and Nathalie Jimenez,",2024-07-07 23:09:47,
189,Liberian president cuts his salary by 40%,"Liberia's President Joseph Boakai has announced that he will slash his salary by 40%. His office said he hoped to set a precedent for ""responsible governance"" and demonstrate ""solidarity"" with Liberians. Government salaries have been under intense scrutiny recently as Liberians complain about the rising cost of living. Around one in five people live on less than $2 (£1.70) a day in the West African state. Mr Boakai revealed in February that his annual salary was $13,400. The cut will bring it down to $8,000.     Mr Boakai's move echoes that of his predecessor, George Weah, who took a 25% cut in his salary.  Some in the West African nation have hailed Mr Boakai's decision, but others wonder whether it is truly a sacrifice given that he also receives benefits like a daily allowance and medical cover.  The presidential office's budget is almost $3m this year.   Anderson D Miamen, from non-profit organisation the Centre of Transparency and Accountability in Liberia, said the president's pay cut is ""welcoming"". ""We just hope that the public will clearly see where the deductions will go and how they will be used to positively impact the lives of the people,” he told the BBC. W Lawrence Yealue II, whose organisation also campaigns for government transparency, described the president's decision as ""very commendable"" and said that ""leadership has to be provided from the top"". He added that hoped Mr Boakai's benefits would be reviewed in the budget for the next financial year. As well as reducing his salary, Mr Boakai has pledged to ""empower"" Liberia's Civil Service Agency to make sure public servants ""receive fair compensation for their contributions to the country"". Last week a group of lawmakers complained they had not received their official cars, which they needed to perform their duties.  As a form of protest, they turned up to parliament in tuk-tuks, known locally as keh keh, a common mode of transport for ordinary Liberians. Mr Boakai took office in January after defeating Mr Weah in a run-off election.  He vowed to tackle corruption and financial mismanagement. As well as declaring his assets since taking office, Mr Boakai has ordered an audit of the presidential office. The results have not yet been released. Mr Boakai has also beefed up the General Auditing Commission and the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission. Mr Weah's government was plagued by allegations of corruption, and lavish spending, which triggered mass protests as the cost of living spiralled for ordinary people.

188,Napoleon's pistols sell for €1.69m at auction,"Two pistols owned by the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, with which he once intended to kill himself, have been sold at auction for €1.69m (£1.4m).  The weapons, which were created by the Paris gunmaker Louis-Marin Gosset, had been expected to fetch between €1.2m and €1.5m.  They were sold at the Osenat auction house on Sunday - next to the Fontainebleau palace where Napoleon tried to take his own life following his abdication in 1814. The pistols' sale comes after France's culture ministry recently classified them as national treasures and banned their export. This means the French government now has 30 months to make a purchase offer to the new owner, who has not been named. It also means the pistols can only leave France temporarily. The guns are inlaid with gold and silver, and feature an engraved image of Napoleon himself in profile.  He was said to have wanted to use them to kill himself on the night of 12 April, 1814 after the defeat of his army by foreign forces meant he had to give up power. However, his grand squire Armand de Caulaincourt removed the powder from the guns and Napoleon instead took poison but survived.  He later gave the pistols to Caulaincourt, who in turn passed them to his descendants.  Also included in the sale were the pistols' original box and various accessories including a powder horn and various powder tamping rods.  Auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat said that the ""image of Napoleon at his lowest point"" was being sold alongside the objects.  Napoleon memorabilia is highly sought after. One of the tricorne hats that became a part of his brand sold for €1.9m in November. The historic leader returned to power in 1815 following his exile to the Mediterranean island of Elba but went on to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo.  He died in 1821 after his second banishment - this time to the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.

187,'Tough to play' - Svitolina's pain after attacks on Ukraine,"This video can not be played Svitolina was emotional as she beat Wang Elina Svitolina found it ""extremely tough"" to play her Wimbledon fourth-round match after Russian strikes killed dozens of people and seriously damaged a children's hospital in her native Ukraine. Svitolina, 29, broke down in tears during an on-court interview after she beat China's Wang Xinyu to reach the quarter-finals. She played the match wearing a black ribbon on her white outfit, knowing there had been mass casualties from the assault on her homeland. ""Today was one of the most difficult matches in my life,"" said Svitolina. ""Mentally it was beyond anything I have ever faced but fails in comparison to what my people at home are going through."" The 2023 Wimbledon semi-finalist is one of Ukraine's most prominent athletes and has spoken regularly about the impact of the war on her country. After her 6-2 6-1 win, Svitolina said: ""It was a good performance from my side and it's a very difficult day today for Ukrainian people."" Svitolina trailed off as she began to cry, with the court two crowd offering sympathetic support. ""It was not easy to focus on the match,"" Svitolina added. ""It was very difficult to read the news and just to go on the court it's extremely tough. ""I'm happy I could play today and get a win."" Svitolina will face 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals. Ukraine's Elina Svitolina is a two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist after runs in 2019 and 2023 Svitolina, a mother of one, said she did want to leave her room after seeing the news when she woke up. At least 36 people were confirmed dead and 140 were injured as a result of Russian missile attacks across Ukraine on Monday. The rare daytime attack killed at least 19 people in Kyiv, including two at the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - which sustained major damage. Svitolina, along with former Ukraine footballer Andriy Shevchenko and heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk, is an ambassador for United24, a fundraising organisation sent up by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier this year, Svitolina said many Ukrainians felt people have lost interest in their ongoing battle to repel the Russian invasion. She wants to use her on-court success to maintain awareness but admitted she feels ""guilt"" at being happy for reaching a Grand Slam quarter-final. ""Many people cannot leave the country. Many people are at war. Many people are fighting, defending our front lines,"" she said. ""We've been living with this feeling for over two years. It's nothing new. But yes [guilt] is not a pleasant feeling to have."" American Danielle Collins' Wimbledon career ended in defeat as the 11th seed was beaten by Czech Barbora Krejcikova under the roof on Court One. Collins, 30, announced in January that this season would be her last on the tour. The former Australian Open finalist was on her best run at Wimbledon, playing in her first fourth-round match, but was beaten 7-5 6-3 by 31st seed Krejcikova. Both players had chances in the opening set before Collins lost serve at 5-5. She was then broken early in the second and needed a medical timeout after injuring her leg while trailing 3-1. Former world number two Krejcikova, 28, broke twice more on her way to a convincing win. The 2022 French Open winner is into her first Wimbledon quarter-final and will face a fellow former Roland Garros champion, Jelena Ostapenko. Earlier on Court One, Latvian 13th seed Ostapenko beat unseeded Kazakh Yulia Putintseva 6-2 6-3 with a dominant performance. Ostapenko's powerful hitting from the baseline proved too much for Putintseva - the player who knocked out top seed Iga Swiatek in the previous round. This video can not be played Kalinskaya retires during second set due to injury against Rybakina Fourth seed Rybakina underlined why she is the new title favourite with a dominant performance against Anna Kalinskaya before her opponent retired injured. Rybakina was 6-3 3-0 ahead on Centre Court when Russian 17th seed Kalinskaya left the last-16 match in tears having been unable to recover from a wrist problem. Russian-born Kazakh player Rybakina is the highest seed left in the women's draw and will face Svitolina next. Rybakina, 25, is the only former Wimbledon champion left in the women’s draw, and her bid has been strengthened by Swiatek and Coco Gauff featuring in a flurry of big names knocked out over the weekend. Rybakina dropped serve in the first game of the match and trailed 3-1 in the opener, but she then won five consecutive games, with two breaks to love, to take the first set, and the procession continued until Kalinskaya forfeited the match.

184,Smelly planet 'reeks of rotten eggs',"A faraway planet known for its dire weather also whiffs of rotten eggs, according to a new study. Scientists studied the atmosphere of HD 189733 b, which has scorching temperatures and precipitation akin to raining glass, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Hydrogen sulphide, which also exists on Jupiter, makes up most of HD 189733 b's atmosphere, and emits a bit of a pong, according to researchers. The gas is also emitted during farts. Finding it here is one of the first detections of hydrogen sulphide on an exoplanet - or planet outside of our solar system. ""So, if your nose could work at 1000C ... the atmosphere would smell like rotten eggs,"" said Dr Guangwei Fu, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins who led the research. The study was published in the journal Nature. Although hydrogen sulphide is one of the gasses that indicate that distant planets might be home to alien organisms, researchers aren't searching for life on this planet because it's a gas giant, like Jupiter, and too hot. However, they say finding hydrogen sulphide here is a step toward understanding how planets form. James Webb is opening up a new vista in analysing the chemicals in faraway planets and so helping astronomers learn more about their origins. ""It's been quite a game changer. It's really revolutionising the field of astronomy. It has delivered the capability promised and it even exceeded our expectations in certain ways,"" said Dr Fu. The researcher plans to use information from the space telescope to study more planets.",2024-07-08 23:09:48,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjm901rdyjdo,"Maddie Molloy,",2024-07-08 15:09:48,
185,Payout for widow of Pakistani journalist killed by Kenyan police,"A court in Kenya has awarded 10m shillings ($78,000; £61,000) in compensation to the widow of a prominent Pakistani journalist who was shot dead by police at a roadblock nearly two years ago.  Arshad Sharif was a TV anchor known for his robust criticism of Pakistan's powerful military leaders and corruption in politics.  The father-of-five received death threats that he flagged to Pakistan's top judge, before fleeing his home country to seek safety abroad. Sharif's killing two months later at the hands of police in the Kenyan town of Kajiado caused outrage, and the slow response by officials prompted UN experts to criticise both Kenya and Pakistan. Kenya's police had argued it was a case of mistaken identity but Sharif's widow, Javeria Siddique, said it was a contract killing carried out on behalf of an unnamed individual in Pakistan. On Monday, the Kajiado High Court rejected ruled that the Kenyan authorities had acted unlawfully and violated Sharif's right to life. It duly awarded Ms Siddique compensation plus interest until payment in full. ""Loss of life cannot be compensated in monetary terms nor is the pain and suffering the family must have gone through. But there's consensus that compensation is appropriate remedy for redress in violation of fundamental rights,"" said Justice Stella Mutuku as she delivered the verdict. The judge also ruled that Kenya's director of public prosecutions and the independent policing oversight authority had violated Sharif's rights by failing to prosecute the two police officers involved. The court has ordered both bodies to conclude investigations and charge the officers. Reacting to the ruling, the lawyer representing Sharif's widow, Ochiel Dudley, said ""this is a win for the family and a win for Kenyans in their quest for police accountability"". Sharif's widow, Ms Siddique, expressed her gratitude to the Kenyan judiciary but   added that her work was far from done. ""This ruling has come as a relief to me and my family, but I will not relent in getting maximum justice for my husband,"" she said. The BBC has asked the Kenyan authorities for their response to the ruling. The police had given conflicting police accounts of Sharif's death. One account claimed the 49-year-old was travelling in a Toyota Land Cruiser which officers mistook for a similar vehicle that had been reported stolen.  In another version of events, police claimed that one of the car passengers had opened fire and then officers responded by shooting back. Like her late husband, Ms Siddique is a journalist, and filed the lawsuit alongside the Kenya Union of Journalists and Kenya Correspondents Association last October. She and her co-petitioners were seeking transparency, an apology, and accountability from the Kenyan authorities for what they called Sharif's ""targeted assassination"".  She told the BBC she was still unable to get justice for her husband in Pakistan, but would continue to campaign for the protection of journalists and would seek the help of the UN and the Committee to Protect Journalists.

183,Hollywood icon Paramount agrees $28bn merger deal,"One of Hollywood's oldest companies, Paramount Global, has agreed to merge with independent film studio Skydance Media. Under the deal, Paramount's non-executive chair Shari Redstone will sell her family's controlling stake in the company in a complex transaction that will result in a new firm worth around $28bn (£21.9bn). It marks the end of an era for the Redstone family, whose late patriarch, Sumner Redstone, transformed a chain of drive-in cinemas into a vast media empire. As well as Paramount, the group includes the television networks CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV. ""Our hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount’s continued success in this rapidly changing environment,"" Ms Redstone said in a statement. According to the company its TV channels have a global reach of over 4.3 billion subscribers across more than 180 countries.  The merger would combine Paramount, home of classic films such as Chinatown and Breakfast at Tiffany's, with its financial partner on several recent big releases, including Top Gun: Maverick and Star Trek Into Darkness. Under the agreement, Skydance will invest around $8bn in Paramount, including paying $2.4bn for National Amusements, which controls the group. National Amusements owns just 10% of Paramount Group's shares but accounts for almost 80% of its voting rights. Paramount said it expected to close the deal by the summer of next year. Paramount Global traces its origins back more than a century to the founding of Paramount Pictures Corporation in 1914. The studio has made many hit films, including the Godfather, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible series. But the entertainment giant has struggled over the past decade. Paramount Global's shares have fallen by more than 75% in the last five years. Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, who founded US technology giant Oracle. The announcement came after eight months of negotiations that saw Redstone holding talks with a number of potential partners including Sony and private equity firm Apollo. In April, Paramount's chief executive Bob Bakish left the company after clashing with Ms Redstone over the planned Skydance deal.

186,WTO chief warns against global trade breakdown,"Global trade “is not having the best of times at the moment”. That is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. “We are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,” she tells the BBC. “Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.” In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Both Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West. President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips. Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports. EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. “We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,” he says. Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year. However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech. “What we've seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we've seen since the end of the Cold War.""  “The last few years, you've had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,” she said. That’s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis. “We're also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. “We're seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.” She warns that “it will be costly for the world” to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (£5.8tn) of lost output in the long run. The EU’s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU. BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help. After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.” When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it’s “mind boggling” that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China’s economy has been growing steadily. Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: “I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.” The chamber’s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China. It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to “de-risk not de-couple” its relations with China. Brussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine. Companies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China. Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars. However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world. This year Panama Canal officials had to reduce the number of ships allowed to traverse the waterway. This is due to a lack of rainfall to fill the lake that feeds the canal. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal is effectively cut off because of ongoing attacks on commercial ships by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. Traffic through the canal is down 90%, according to logistics firm Kuehne+Nagel. Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd, says this disruption means that the rates his firm charges are up between 30% and 40%. Whilst shipping costs are a small part of retail prices, Mr Habben Jansen says “these extra costs in the end get passed on” to consumers. That could end up pushing inflation up just as central banks are showing signs of getting it under control. That would be “detrimental to consumers,” says the WTO’s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. Despite all the tensions, she says trade has shown signs of resilience, and she adds that her organization can help countries solve their differences. Meanwhile, Dr Okonjo-Iweala admits that some WTO rules will need to change to help meet the challenge of climate change.  “I strongly believe that some of our [global trade] rules, we do need to look at them,"" she says. “When they were put in place, decades ago, we were not confronting the kind of climate change threats we confront today.” Regarding the increased use of tariffs, she adds: “We hope we don't have a repeat of what we saw in the 1930s. We had retaliatory tariffs, and it was downhill from there and everyone lost. “So I do hope we will not enter into that kind of era again”.

The 26-year-old joins Chris Woakes and the retiring James Anderson as the specialist seamers. Atkinson's Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith, 23, will also make his Test bow behind the stumps, a move confirmed when he was named in the squad ahead of Jonny Bairstow and Ben Foakes. Atkinson, who has played nine one-day internationals and three T20s, was part of the England squad for the Test tour of India earlier this year, but did not feature. Smith usually plays for Surrey as a specialist batter with Foakes taking the gloves, although he was England's keeper for the two one-day internationals he played against Ireland last year. Off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, picked in the England squad ahead of his Somerset team-mate Jack Leach, plays his first home Test after winning three caps on the tour of India.

Take our quiz on Anderson's Test wickets Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words Overall, England have a fresh look for the first Test in the three-match series against the Windies. There are four changes from the side heavily beaten in the final Test of the 4-1 series defeat in India and four from the last home Test against Australia at The Oval last July. Leach, Foakes and Bairstow have been left out, while 41-year-old Anderson has been told this will be the last international match of a record-breaking career that has seen him become England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker. Atkinson, capable of bowling at high pace, has taken 59 wickets in 19 first-class matches. He gets the nod ahead of Matthew Potts and the uncapped Dillon Pennington, who are the other seamers in the squad. Smith has long been touted as a future England prospect. An attractive stroke-maker, he averages more than 40 in first-class cricket and in excess of 56 in the County Championship this season. Along with the debutants, batter Harry Brook returns at number five after missing the tour of India to be with his ill grandmother, who passed away in March.

The all-rounder had surgery in November and tentatively returned to bowling in India before accelerating his rehab in three County Championship matches for Durham.

196,Bellamy set to be named Wales manager,"Craig Bellamy is expected to leave Championship Burnley to succeed former Wales team-mate Rob Page Craig Bellamy is set to be named the new Wales manager. The 44-year-old has emerged as the Football Association of Wales (FAW's) first choice to replace Rob Page, who was sacked last month. Bellamy is currently at Burnley, where he had been acting head coach before Scott Parker’s appointment last week. Parker was keen to work with the Welshman, but it appears the former Wales captain is attracted to managing his country. BBC Sport Wales understands the final details of a deal are still be agreed with both Bellamy and Burnley.  But an appointment is understood to be close, bringing an end the search to replace Page who was sacked in June after Wales failed to qualify for Euro 2024. Bellamy has long stated his ambition to manage his country and met with senior FAW figures last week. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, Georgia boss Willy Sagnol and surprise contender Oxford United boss Des Buckingham were all spoken to about the post. But Bellamy, who narrowly missed out to Ryan Giggs for job in 2018, is said to have impressed during discussions – and will now get the chance to lead the side in qualification for the 2026 World Cup. His first game as Wales manager will be a Nations League home tie against Turkey on 6 September, followed by a trip to Montenegro on 9 September. Bellamy scored 19 times for Wales, including the winner against Italy in 2002. Bellamy made 78 appearances for Wales before retiring from international football in 2013, missing out on the chance to play in a major finals when Wales qualified under Chris Coleman two years later. He took his first steps in coaching with Cardiff City’s academy before serving as assistant manager to former Manchester City team-mate Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht and then Burnley. Bellamy stood in when Kompany served a touchline ban last season and stepped up when the Belgian left for Bayern Munich in May. But with Burnley opting for former Fulham and Bournemouth manager Parker for the permanent role, it opened the door for the FAW. Bellamy now appears ready to return to Wales having ended his playing career with hometown club Cardiff City, helping them to promotion to the Premier League in 2014. The inside story of Page's rise and fall as Wales boss FAW sets out criteria to succeed Page as Wales boss FAW suspends president Williams pending investigation Having started his playing career at Norwich, Bellamy's playing career spanned many of the biggest clubs in British football, including Newcastle, Celtic, Manchester City and Liverpool, twice. But even as a player he was keen to broaden his outlook beyond the domestic game and when coming through the professional ranks as a player, would regularly go to watch football on the continent. While accruing plenty of international experience with Wales, Bellamy, who netted 19 goals for his country, was part of the Great Britain team at the 2012 Olympics. Bellamy is seventh in both the all time list of Wales international goal scorers and cap holders, and was one vote shy from beating Giggs to succeed Coleman for the the national job. He had previously helped coach Wales age-grade sides but, having turned down the chance to take his first steps into frontline management with Oxford in 2018, Bellamy’s breakthrough will now come at the highest level.",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cek929j2xp1o,Rob Phillips,2024-07-08 21:09:49,

""I don't accept it. I know they were cheering for Rune but that's an excuse to also boo. ""I've been on the tour for more than 20 years - trust me, I know all the tricks, I know how it works. You guys can't touch me."" The 37-year-old is going for an eighth Wimbledon title and record 25th Grand Slam overall. He will next play Alex de Minaur, who booked his spot in the quarter-finals with a 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-3 win against France's Arthur Fils. The real drama of the day in the men's singles came as American Taylor Fritz produced a magnificent escape act by battling from two sets down to beat fourth seed Alexander Zverev. 'An excuse to boo' - Djokovic irked by Wimbledon crowd 'Tough to play' - Svitolina's pain after attacks on Ukraine Hewett 'not far away' from Wimbledon singles glory Before Monday's final match on Centre Court, Djokovic said there would be ""fireworks"" when he faced Rune. The Dane had defeated Djokovic twice before - wins that helped establish him as one of the sport's rising stars. However, he rarely came close to troubling the second seed on this occasion, failing to make the most of just two break points. Still sporting a knee support on his right leg following surgery in June, Djokovic got off to a lightning start, winning the first 12 points and assuming a 3-0 advantage. Djokovic seemed to struggle with a stomach problem early in the second set, clutching his abdomen and taking deep breaths between points. However, he was still able to assert control for the remainder of the match and secured the straightforward victory in a little over two hours.

Zverev was aiming to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the first time and did not face a break point in the opening two sets. But Fritz, 26, became the first player to break the Zverev serve at this tournament during the third set, before edging the fourth to move the match into a decider. Zverev was wearing a support on his left knee after slipping in the late stages of his third-round win over Britain's Cameron Norrie, and as he faded a crucial break went the way of Fritz in the fourth game of the final set. For Fritz, a second appearance in the last eight at Wimbledon awaits him, two years after he lost to Rafael Nadal in a five-set thriller at that stage. It will be a fourth Grand Slam quarter-final in all for him, and he has yet to go further. Zverev had been only two games away from victory in the third set but has now fallen at the last-16 stage of Wimbledon on three occasions after experiencing the same fate in 2017 and 2021. ""It was amazing to do that on Centre Court, two sets down in front of this crowd. It's a dream,"" said a victorious Fritz, who gained only the third win of his career from being two sets behind. ""I still felt I was playing really well despite being down two sets. I was just thinking it sucked to be playing this well and to lose in straights. ""It's a second time in the quarter-finals, but this time I felt I earned it a lot more so I'm really excited for the chance.""

Italian 25th seed Musetti struggled against his big-serving French opponent in the first set before adapting his approach to win 4-6 6-3 6-3 6-2. Defeat ended an impressive run for Mpetshi Perricard, who was attempting to become the first lucky loser, man or woman, to reach the singles quarter-finals of a Grand Slam. An emotional Musetti said after his victory: ""It is a really phenomenal day for me."" Playing on his 21st birthday, Mpetshi Perricard entertained the court two crowd in the early stages with trick shots and huge serves. He lost in the final round of qualifying before being handed a reprieve after withdrawals from the main draw, and then made eye-catching progress - until Musetti had too much for him. The 22-year-old Musetti said: ""I've been dreaming of this moment since I was a kid. I always had a really beautiful family that always supported me."" The win continues an impressive grass-court swing for Musetti, who was a runner-up to Tommy Paul at Queen's Club last month.

193,Who will win Euros? Insiders from last four give their verdicts,"England, France, the Netherlands and Spain are vying to reach the final of Euro 2024 Four teams are preparing for the semi-finals of Euro 2024, with Spain set to face France on Tuesday while England take on the Netherlands the following day. Spain are seeking to win the tournament for the fourth time, having most recently triumphed in 2012. France last won it 24 years ago while the Dutch triumphed in 1988 - and England are of course hoping to end their wait for a first men's European Championship. So who is looking in the best shape for their semi-final, and who could win it all?  BBC Sport asked experts from each country for their views, and you can vote for who you think will lift the trophy at the end. Spain came through a tough game against Germany to reach the semi-finals Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague: Spain displayed three different ways against Germany. We played with wingers, then without wingers and no striker and then finally 4-2-4 in extra time, which means we have layers. The main thing is we adapted to anything Germany threw at us. Yes we could have lost, but we were never far away from winning it either. While we were superior to the previous four opponents but we were not against Germany. However we did not give up and got the victory, so it was a different test, one of resilience, faith in the idea, collaboration and insistence, and we came out of it well. It was also a very physical encounter; it was the most amount of fouls in a game in a European Championship since 2016, but we showed we are not now scared of that either. We showed a conservative streak when, while ahead, Fullkrug appeared on the scene, balls were crossed into the box and we dropped too deep. We had a team designed to keep the score; perhaps we can learn from that because being too intimidated and hiding in your own box is not, for us, a guarantee of success. Against France we know we will have to take the initiative, like we had to do against Italy, Albania and Georgia. We will have to be careful against counter-attacks, in the same way as we did against all our opponents. We are good at stopping them though, having committed the largest number of tactical fouls. I know for France to win they do not have to play well, so it will important to be focused the whole game as they keep looking for a moment of brilliance from their front men. We will have to be careful against France's pace, with the likes of Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappe. Perhaps we are not as efficient as we should be up front, but because we press so often, and keep shooting and attacking and creating opportunities, eventually we tend to crack the nut and I feel that will happen against France again. We have suspensions, and Pedri was injured in the last game, but there is not a huge difference between our best player and our 'worst'. It is a team that behave at all times as that, as a collective, and with great flexibility, reading well what happens on the pitch. I think we will beat France and will meet England in the final. WINNER: Spain  'Magic moments and resilience can lead England to history' 'One of the world's best' - Saka's 'special' moment of redemption The 'leader', Gakpo's goals & a sea of orange - watch out England England came through a penalty shootout to beat Switzerland and reach the last four BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty: England must harness the resilience they have shown in the face of adversity and the individual brilliance from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka that has put them in the semi-final into a more cohesive team performance to beat the Netherlands. Gareth Southgate's side have struggled in Euro 2024 against sides who have defended deep, so the more attacking approach of the Netherlands might just suit them and give England’s creative players more room for manoeuvre. England will need to be at their best defensively because the Dutch pose a serious threat in attack, with Liverpool’s Cody Gakpo having a fine tournament and the unpredictable Memphis Depay always dangerous. If England get it right they can trouble a Netherlands defence that has looked vulnerable under pressure, with the potential battle between the respective captains Harry Kane and Virgil van Dijk a key component. Kane struggled desperately in England’s quarter-final against Switzerland, looking physically short and off the pace, but you would still not bet against him taking the big chance if one comes along. England are now, despite indifferent performances so far, in a position where they are serious contenders to win Euro 2024. They have reached the semi-finals almost in spite of themselves, but confidence must surely be growing and teams often get a sense of destiny being with them at this stage of major competitions – think Greece in 2004 and Portugal in 2016. If England were to win their first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup, this would not surprise me – but while a sixth sense says England, the head says Spain. Spain have looked the best team in what has been a mixed Euro 2024 although they could still come unstuck against a hugely talented but regimented France under Didier Deschamps. None of France's players have scored a goal from open play while Spain have been fluent with Lamine Yamal, who is not 17 until the day before the final, a revelation in a side that also boasts world-class talent in the shape of figures such as Manchester City’s Rodri. Spain have a potent mix of youth and experience, are growing into the competition and have looked the most impressive team from the start – but I believe they will have to get past England to win Euro 2024. WINNERS: Spain. Kylian Mbappe has scored one goal so far at Euro 2024 - a penalty against Poland in the group stage French football journalist Julien Laurens: We have seen the best of France defensively, certainly. This is what they do, it is their style and it is their DNA. It is also how you win tournaments, being solid defensively. Where they have perhaps not been at their best is with the ball. They do not play sexy football, it is not what they are about - but they have been lacking in terms of creating chances. They are usually more effective in the opposition's box.  Along with Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe has possibly been the biggest disappointment at this tournament. There are a few explanations, the first being the mask he has had to wear after breaking his nose against Austria. In that game he had looked quite sharp. He also had a few fitness issues before the Euros, so I do not think he is fully fit - but the mask is also really bothering him. If there is one team that can frustrate Spain more than any other here, it is France. For me, with Spain's problems in midfield as a result of Pedri's injury it will be a case of who wins the battle in the middle. The physical impact the France midfield has is incredible and that is where the game will be won. This will be a big game for Antoine Griezmann considering he has spent more of his career in Spain than in France, so we need him and Mbappe to raise their games. I want a France-England final and I think France, of the four semi-finalists, have the ruthlessness and the experience of this level. I also think at some point Kylian will become Kylian again and will be unbeatable. WINNERS: France  Wout Weghorst has been a useful weapon off the bench for the Netherlands Dutch SoccerNews.nl football writer Jesper Langbroek: The Turkey game I think showed the Netherlands have a good Plan B - using Wout Weghorst as a striker with Memphis Depay just behind. England played with five defenders against Switzerland, so it made it very compact in that area. I think this is the way we need to play if we are going to do it. The thing I have noticed with this team is they need a wake-up call to get going. They had that against Austria and then against Romania they were good. Then they had another wake-up call when Turkey took the lead in the quarter-final. There is more in both these teams but they are not coming out yet - and that is a similarity between the sides. I think the winner will come from the other side of the draw. England and the Netherlands have not yet been tested really; they have faced some good teams but not played the big countries as they are on the other side of the draw. I think Spain will win because they are playing good football as a collective. England, France and the Netherlands are still waiting to get everything together, but time is running out.

192,Sunak names new top team as Lord Cameron resigns,"Rishi Sunak has confirmed his interim shadow cabinet, after 12 members of his top team lost their seats in the general election.  Ex-Prime Minister Lord Cameron, who had made a surprise return to cabinet in November, has resigned and been replaced by his former deputy Andrew Mitchell as shadow foreign secretary.  Richard Holden has also resigned as party chairman, after what he described as a ""very tough set of results"", and is replaced by former Economic Secretary to the Treasury Richard Fuller as interim chairman. Many of the key briefs remain unchanged, with Jeremy Hunt named as shadow chancellor and James Cleverly as shadow home secretary, mirroring the portfolios they held in government.  However, James Cartlidge has been appointed shadow defence secretary and Ed Argar shadow justice secretary, after Grant Shapps and Alex Chalk lost their seats. The Conservatives now have only 121 MPs - the lowest number in the party's history - after losing 251 seats in a Labour landslide. Writing on social media, Lord Cameron said: ""It’s been a huge honour to serve as foreign secretary, but clearly the Conservative Party in opposition will need to shadow the new foreign secretary from the Commons."" He added: ""As a committed Conservative I will continue to support the party and help where I can as we rebuild from the very disappointing election result."" As a peer, Lord Cameron did not face his opposite number in the Commons.  In other changes:  Among those who will continue to shadow their former posts are Oliver Dowden, as deputy leader of the opposition, Victoria Atkins as shadow health secretary and Claire Coutinho as shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero. Interim party chairman Richard Fuller said: ""The Conservative Party has had a difficult election and it is important that we regroup and reflect on these results. “We should also challenge ourselves candidly and deeply on the strengths of the Conservative Party across the country and outline where improvements can be made."" In his resignation letter Mr Holden, who held the previously safe Conservative seat of Basildon and Billericay by just 20 votes, said it had been ""the greatest honour of my life"" to be party chairman.  He said there needed to be a ""thorough review"" of the election campaign, adding: ""While I will obviously feed into that, this would best take place with a new set of eyes to help provide the clearest view."" Mr Sunak has said he will stay on as party leader until arrangements for selecting his successor are in place. The timetable for this remains unclear and no Tories have confirmed they will run to replace him yet. Among the figures tipped to stand are former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, shadow health secretary Ms Atkins and new shadow levelling up secretary Ms Badenoch.  The other positions confirmed are: ",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgm3g37klko,"Becky Morton,",2024-07-08 20:09:49,
191,Shaw 'fit and ready' to play 90 minutes for England,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Luke Shaw 'fit and ready to go' for England England defender Luke Shaw says he is fit and ready to play 90 minutes at Euro 2024. Shaw, the only specialist left-back in Gareth Southgate’s squad, did not play in England’s first four matches of the Euros because of a hamstring injury. But the Manchester United player came on as a second-half substitute during the quarter-final victory over Switzerland - and says he is now ready to play a bigger part in England’s campaign. ""Of course, I think I am [fit and ready to play 90 minutes],” Shaw said. “That is down to Gareth's decision. I feel fit and ready to go."" Shaw’s appearance from the bench after 78 minutes against Switzerland marked his first competitive football since suffering his injury in February. Southgate had hoped to have Shaw back during the group stage in Germany, but his recovery took longer than expected and has meant Kieran Trippier deputising on the left side of defence. ""The last four months have been really tough,” Shaw said of his injury problems. “At the start I was expected to come back a lot sooner, but I went through a lot of setbacks. “It was really nice to get on the other night and get some minutes - I've been itching. ""I think before the squad got announced, we had a plan to come back around the second or third game but, unfortunately, things didn't go as planned and I was pushed back a game or so. ""Of course, it's tough. They were really there for me, not just Gareth and Steve [Holland, England assistant manager] but the medical staff as well. I have a lot to thank them for."" Euro 2024 highlights Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Shaw has 32 caps for England, 26 of them earned under Gareth Southgate Shaw has had to sit and watch from the sidelines as England reached the semi-finals of a second successive European Championship. The 28-year-old has been focusing on his recovery, to the extent that he pulled out of a scheduled media conference before the Switzerland game as he did not want to speak to the press before he had got back on the field of play. ""It's been strange,” he said of his Euro 2024 experience. “It's also been difficult as well, going to games, feeling the atmosphere. Not putting the shirt on or being involved in games was hard, but that motivated me more to work back. ""The atmosphere in those games spurred me on. ""I was of course excited to come back, but the priority was to help us get back into the game and get us through."" Without Shaw, England have not always impressed at Euro 2024 – drawing their final two group matches before going behind in both knockout games so far. But brilliant equalisers by Jude Bellingham against Slovakia and Bukayo Saka versus Switzerland have helped them through. Born in the Football League - England's EFL journey Who will win Euros? Insiders from last four give their verdicts Zwayer to referee Netherlands v England Shaw was the only specialist left-back picked by Southgate for the England squad at Euro 2024 Shaw knows what it is like to score a big goal in a European Championship – he opened the scoring for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy inside three minutes with a powerful volley. But watching from the bench, he says he has been put through the wringer just as much as the England fans. ""I felt more nervous watching than playing - it is quite tough,” he said. ""I never once thought that we were going to go out. We have to believe right to the end. ""Good moments like Jude's [equaliser] can happen, but it's down to us to deliver that on the pitch. ""Game by game we are getting better - there's things we can still improve on but we're looking good."" Shaw has become a key player under Southgate, starting every match at the 2022 World Cup, and defended his manager over the criticism he has received for his selections and style of play. ""I don't understand the criticism,” Shaw said of Southgate, who has become the first man to lead England to three major tournament semi-finals. “What he's done for the country and us players, he's taken us to the next level. No manager has been as successful as he has recently. ""Us players love him - he's exactly what we need. He allows us to go out on the pitch and be our best. He's shown a lot of faith and trust in picking me.""",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c728j0vg54lo,Unknown,2024-07-08 16:09:49,
190,US name Bradley as 2025 Ryder Cup captain,"Keegan Bradley has won one major and six PGA Tour events since turning professional in 2008 Keegan Bradley will captain the United States in the 2025 Ryder Cup against Europe.  The 38-year-old was not the first choice for the role, but 15-time major champion Tiger Woods turned it down. ""My passion and appreciation for golf's greatest team event have never been stronger,"" said Bradley, who was on the losing side in his two appearances as a player - in 2012 and 2014. ""The Ryder Cup is unlike any other competition in our sport. And this edition will undoubtedly be particularly special given the rich history and enthusiastic spectators at this iconic course.  ""I look forward to beginning preparations."" The 45th edition of the biennial contest will take place at the Bethpage Black course in New York from 25-28 September. Woods had been a long-time favourite to succeed Zach Johnson and lead the US side as they look to bounce back from a 16½-11½ defeat in Rome last September. But the former world number one, who played on eight Ryder Cup teams, repeatedly delayed his decision. He said at the US PGA Championship in May that he did not want to ""fulfill the role of the captaincy if I can't do it"", citing his position on the PGA Tour policy board as something that was taking up a lot of his time. And given the announcement of Bradley as captain, it would appear Woods finally decided he could not dedicate the time to the role that he would want to. Bradley, who won his solitary major at the 2011 US PGA Championship, was on the losing Ryder Cup teams in 2012 - as Europe won the 'Miracle of Medinah' - and two years later at Gleneagles in Scotland. PGA of America president John Lindert, who made the announcement, said: ""Keegan's past Ryder Cup experience, strong relationships and unwavering passion for this event will prove invaluable as he guides the US team over the next year and a half. ""We are confident that with Keegan at the helm, the 2025 US Ryder Cup Team will compete at Bethpage with the same confidence and determination that has defined his career."" It would appear to be a change in direction for the PGA of America, who run the US Ryder Cup team. Recent captains Johnson, Jim Furyk and Davis Love III all served as an assistant captain at least once before taking on the top job. Bradley, who has won five PGA Tour events, to add to his major, since turning professional in 2008, has not been near the side since 2014. In his two Ryder Cup appearances, he won four and lost three matches - one of the defeats being in a singles match against Rory McIlroy in 2012 when the Northern Irishman almost missed his tee-time. Despite winning twice on the PGA Tour last year, Bradley missed out on one of the six automatic qualifying places on the US team. He finished 11th overall but was then overlooked when captain Johnson selected six wildcard picks for Rome, with Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler selected despite being lower down the rankings. Bradley was being filmed at home for the Netflix documentary Full Swing when Johnson phoned to tell him he would not make the team.  His disappointment was obvious, as he said: ""I’m thinking about the Ryder Cup every second of every day.” In an earlier interview with Sports Illustrated, Bradley said he knew there was ""a big risk"" he would not be selected. Thomas, who was 15th on the qualifying list, had previously had a successful pairing with his good friend Jordan Spieth, who was eighth on the list and also selected by Johnson, who was criticised after the defeat for fostering a ""boys"" club. ""The thing is, those guys are close. They’re not just PGA Tour-close, they’re close friends,” Bradley said.  “If you take golf out of the equation, they’re legit close friends. You have your close friends as a golfer and then you have your close PGA Tour friends, and a lot of the time your close friends aren’t on the Tour.” Former Ryder Cup player: Check. Major winner: Check. Keegan Bradley ticks the two qualifying criteria the USA usually demands of its Ryder Cup captains. But the appointment of the 2011 US PGA champion still comes from way out of left field. And some. Bradley has always been regarded as an outsider. An idiosyncratic character, not deemed sufficiently a team player to earn a captain’s wildcard for the last Ryder Cup despite his persuasive form.  It was an omission more down to personality than play. Now he is regarded as the man to galvanise the Americans to win back the trophy lost so comprehensively at Marco Simone last year. Astonishing. His two appearances for the US were on losing teams despite his own impassioned performances.  Bradley will be 39 by the time of the contest, the youngest US captain since a 34-year-old Arnold Palmer was a playing captain in 1963, but he hardly carries the same stature. Bethpage next year will be a place for cool heads amid an expected bear pit atmosphere. But Bradley has a combustible streak as we witnessed in a bust up with Miguel Angel Jimenez at the WGC Matchplay a few years ago.  “He’ll start a riot,” one observer claimed in the wake of this appointment. That is probably stretching it, but for the US to go with someone who does not even posses experience as a vice-captain is an extraordinary gamble. Bradley did win respect for the dignified way he accepted his non selection for the last match. But no one would have predicted it would pave the way for him to take charge of the US quest to win back the Ryder Cup.",2024-07-08 23:09:49,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c134x427myko,Peter Scrivener,2024-07-08 21:09:49,
207,How Canada became a car theft capital of the world,"Logan LaFreniere woke up one October morning in 2022 to an empty driveway. His brand new Ram Rebel truck was missing.  His security camera captured two hooded men breaking into the pickup in the dead of night outside of his Milton, Ontario home, and driving it away with ease. A few months later, that very same truck appeared on a website of vehicles for sale in Ghana, an ocean and some 8,500km away. “The dead giveaway was the laptop holder that we had installed in the back of the driver’s seat for my son, and in it was garbage that he had put in there,” Mr LaFreniere told the BBC. That same clutter was visible in photos of the car listing, he said. “There was no doubt in my mind that it was my vehicle.” Mr LaFreniere’s story is hardly unique. In 2022, more than 105,000 cars were stolen in Canada - about one car every five minutes. Among the victims was Canada’s very own federal justice minister, whose government-issued Toyota Highlander XLE was taken twice by thieves. Early this summer, Interpol listed Canada among the top 10 worst countries for car thefts out of 137 in its database - a “remarkable” feat, said a spokesperson, considering the country only began integrating their data with the international police organisation in February. Authorities say once these cars are stolen, they are either used to carry out other violent crimes, sold domestically to other unsuspecting Canadians, or shipped overseas to be resold. Interpol says it has detected more than 1,500 cars around the world that have been stolen from Canada since February, and around 200 more continue to be identified each week, usually at ports in other countries. Car theft is such an epidemic that it was declared a “national crisis” by the Insurance Bureau of Canada, which says insurers have had to pay out more than C$1.5bn ($1bn; £860m) in vehicle theft claims last year. The problem has forced police jurisdictions across the country to issue public bulletins on how to protect vehicles from theft. Meanwhile, some Canadians have taken matters into their own hands, doing everything from installing trackers on their cars to hiring private neighbourhood security. Some who can afford it have even installed retractable bollards in their driveways - similar to those seen at banks and embassies - to try and deter thieves. Nauman Khan, who lives in Mississauga, a city just outside Toronto, started a bollard-installation business after he and his brother were both victims of car thefts. In one attempt, Mr Khan said the thieves broke into his home while his wife and young children were sleeping. They were looking for the keys to his Mercedes GLE parked out front, he said, but ran after he confronted them. After that “traumatic” experience, they sold their cars except for two “humble” family vehicles. Through his business, Mr Khan said he now hears similar stories from people throughout the region of Toronto. “It’s been very busy,” he said. “We had one client whose street had so many home invasions that he’d hired a security guard every night outside his house because he just didn’t feel safe.” The pervasiveness of car thefts in Canada is surprising given how small the country’s population is compared to the US and the UK - other countries with high rates of such crime, says Alexis Piquero, Director of the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. “[Canada] also doesn’t have as many port cities as the US does,” said Mr Piquero. While the US, Canada and the UK have all experienced a spike in car thefts since the Covid-19 pandemic, Canada’s rate of thefts (262.5 per 100,000 people) is higher than that of England and Wales (220 per 100,000 people), according to the latest available data from each country. It is also fairly close to that of the US, which sits at around 300 vehicle thefts per 100,000 people, based on 2022 data. The rise in recent years is partly due to a pandemic-driven global car shortage that has increased demand for both used and new vehicles.  There is also a growing market for certain car models internationally, making auto theft a top revenue generator for organised crime groups, said Elliott Silverstein, director of government relations at the Canadian Automobile Association. But Mr Silverstein said the way that Canada’s ports operate make them more vulnerable to this type of theft than other countries. “In the port system, there’s a greater focus on what is coming into the country than what is exiting the country,” he said, adding that once the vehicles are packed up in shipping containers at a port it becomes harder to get to them.   Police have managed to recover some stolen cars.  In October, the Toronto Police Service announced an 11-month investigation that recovered 1,080 vehicles worth around C$60m. More than 550 charges were laid as a result.   And between mid-December and the end of March, border and police officers found nearly 600 stolen vehicles at the Port of Montreal after inspecting 400 shipping containers. These types of operations, however, can be difficult to carry out given the volume of merchandise that moves through that port, experts have said. Around 1.7 million containers moved through the Port of Montreal in 2023 alone. Port staff also do not have the authority to inspect containers in most cases, and in customs-controlled areas only border officers can open a container without a warrant. At the same time, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has been grappling with chronic understaffing, according to a report submitted by its union to the government in April. Outdated technology is also an issue.  Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton - another Ontario city hard-hit by car thefts - recently paid a visit to the Port Newark Container Terminal in New Jersey to compare inspection tactics between the US and Canada. He told the National Post newspaper that US authorities have “got scanners. They measure density. They work closely with local law enforcement”. “These are things that we don’t do in Canada,” he said. In May, the Canadian government said it would invest millions to bolster the CBSA’s ability to search shipping containers. Police will also get additional money to combat auto theft in their communities. But Mr Silverstein said he believes a missing puzzle piece is auto manufacturers themselves. “Everyone is talking about trying to recover vehicles, and a lot of my focus has been on why we are not making the vehicles tougher to steal in the first place,” he said. In the meantime, car owners like Mr LaFreniere are still grappling with what to do to keep their vehicles safe. After his Ram Rebel truck was stolen, he replaced it with a Toyota Tundra - a vehicle that Mr LaFreniere described as his “dream truck”. This time, he installed an engine immobiliser on it to prevent thieves from being able to easily start the car. He also equipped it with a tag tracker in case it did get stolen, and added a club on the steering wheel for good measure. Thieves were undeterred. A pair came to Mr LaFreniere’s driveway, this time to steal the Tundra. They had a harder time, however, and resorted to shattering the back window to get inside. The commotion woke Mr LaFreniere and he called 911. But the thieves managed to run away in the four minutes it took for police to arrive. He paid to repair his brand new truck and then sold it. The whole ordeal, he said, was nothing short of “disheartening”.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy79dq2n093o,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-09 00:11:34,
206,Canada faces pressure at Nato summit for riding on 'coattails',"Canada is under mounting pressure to increase its military spending as it continues to fall short of the target set out for Nato members, raising fears that the country is becoming an outlier among its allies. That message is expected to be made clear this week as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends the Nato summit in Washington DC to mark the military alliance’s 75th anniversary. Canada, a Nato-founding member, ranks seventh overall in the amount of money spent on defence among the 32-nation alliance. But it falls way short of the alliance’s doctrine, which requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military. Using that metric, Canada - which spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military - is  ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the alliance. By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%. Canada’s defence budget currently stands at C$27bn ($19.8bn, £15.5bn), though the Trudeau government has promised in its most recent budget that it will boost spending to almost C$50bn by 2030. Still, that would only make up 1.76% of Canada’s GDP, meaning the country will continue to lag behind its allies in the coming decade. Frustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators. “We are concerned and profoundly disappointed that Canada’s most recent projection indicated that it will not reach its two percent commitment this decade,” the senators wrote. The US ambassador to Canada David Cohen has also taken note, saying in a recent interview with Global News that Canada is now “the outlier in the entire alliance”. In less diplomatic remarks, US House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Monday that it is “shameful” Canada has not hit the 2% mark. “Talk about riding America’s coattails,” he said. In response, Canada’s defence minister, Bill Blair, said at the Foreign Policy Security Forum on Monday that the country will soon share a “credible, verifiable plan” to boost its military spending. “I’m very confident that it’s going to bring us to that threshold,” Mr Blair said. Meanwhile, Canada’s ambassador in Washington, Kristen Hillman, told reporters that while the pressure is on to step up, there is also “a strong recognition that Canada is a steadfast ally in all aspects”. The alliance finds itself at a critical moment.  Member nations are dealing with a more aggressive Russia that is continuing to wage a war in Ukraine. There is also the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House, who successfully pushed European Nato members to boost spending when he was US president. Mr Trump has continued to speak on Nato spending on the campaign trail, once floating the idea of letting Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to alliance members who failed to meet targets.  If Canada does not meet its spending commitments, it could open itself up to pressure from Mr Trump if he wins November's presidential election.  European allies may also grow resentful, said Christopher Sands, head of the Washington DC-based Wilson Center’s Canada Institute. Canada is already feeling the consequences in other ways, he said.  It has ambitions to be part of  US-led Indo-Pacific economic talks, which includes countries like Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea.  But so far, Canada has been left out.  It has also been excluded from the AUKUS defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US. “That’s where the real rubber hits the road for Canada. Nobody invites you to the conversation because - without wanting to embarrass you - they know you don’t have what it takes to be a serious player,” Mr Sands said. Philippe Legassé, a Carleton University professor whose research focuses on defence policy and procurement, said there are a number of reasons why Canada lags behind in spending despite being a relatively financially strong country. First, the Canadian public does not see defence spending as a priority when measured against other needs, like healthcare and other social services. “Both major parties in Canada recognise that it is in their political interest to spend at a certain level that shows you are taking care of the armed forces, but not necessarily at a level where it begins to impact your other priorities,” Prof Legassé said. Another reason is that, historically, Canada did not focus on its military spending as much because it was protected by nuclear allies like the UK and the US.  It saw its value in other collective security endeavours, including peacekeeping.  At the onset of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, deficits in Canada’s military capabilities became clear and launched a wave of spending, said Mr Sands. But Canada is still playing catch up after decades of neglect and struggles when it comes to critical issues like procurement. Aside from the pointed remarks by Speaker Johnson, experts anticipate much of the pressure on Canada at the Nato summit will be made behind closed doors, rather than direct criticism aimed at Mr Trudeau. “It’s a little delicate because Canada is doing quite a bit in terms of tangible contributions,” Prof Legassé said. That includes support for Ukraine and work leading the multinational Nato battlegroup in Latvia. He added that US President Joe Biden and a number of other Nato leaders are ideologically aligned with Mr Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader, and would prefer not to pressure him publicly.  “They don’t necessarily want to give fuel to the idea amongst Canadian conservatives and the general public that the Trudeau government is failing miserably,” he said.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4ygzlz4mzo,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-09 19:11:34,

204,US officials uncover alleged Russian ‘bot farm’,"US officials say they have taken action against an AI-powered information operation run from Russia, including nearly 1,000 accounts pretending to be Americans. The accounts on X were designed to spread pro-Russia stories but were automated “bots” - not real people. In court documents made public Tuesday the US justice department said the operation was devised by a deputy editor at Kremlin-owned RT, formerly Russia Today. RT runs TV channels in English and several other languages, but appears much more popular on social media than on conventional airwaves. The justice department seized two websites that were used to issue emails associated with the bot accounts, and ordered X to turn over information relating to 968 accounts that investigators say were bots. According to the court documents, artificial intelligence was used to create the accounts, which then spread pro-Russian story lines, particularly about the war in Ukraine.   “Today’s actions represent a first in disrupting a Russian-sponsored generative AI-enhanced social media bot farm,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Russia intended to use this bot farm to disseminate AI-generated foreign disinformation, scaling their work with the assistance of AI to undermine our partners in Ukraine and influence geopolitical narratives favorable to the Russian government,” Mr Wray said in a statement. The accounts now appear to have been deleted by X, and screenshots shared by FBI investigators indicated that they had very few followers.  The court documents detailed how the so-called “bot farm” was the brainchild of an RT deputy editor-in-chief who was looking for new ways to distribute stories. RT America was shut down when several major US cable TV providers dropped it shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Another RT employee developed the network, the court documents said, and later a Russian intelligence officer joined the effort, which the justice department described as an attempt “to sow discord in the United States by spreading misinformation”. No criminal charges have been made public in the case, but the justice department noted that its investigation is ongoing. Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation, said it was not surprising that a Russia-linked operation was relying on AI to create fake accounts. “This used to be one of the more time consuming parts of their work; now it has been made much smoother by the technologies that abetted this operation,” she said, noting that the operation appears to have been thwarted before it gained traction. “Artificial intelligence is now clearly part of the disinformation arsenal,” Ms Jankowicz said. The BBC contacted X, RT and the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment. A recent BBC investigation uncovered details of a separate attempt to bolster a Russia-based disinformation network, through the use of fake news sites populated by stories rewritten by AI.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng24pxkelo,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-09 21:11:34,
203,Russian court orders arrest of Yulia Navalnaya,"A court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on charges of extremism, according to state media. The charges brought against Yulia Navalnaya, who lives outside Russia, in absentia are to do with her alleged ""participation in an extremist society"", Tass news agency said.  Navalny was Russia's most significant opposition leader of the past decade. He died in February in an Arctic Circle jail. Russian authorities said he died of natural causes - but his widow said Navalny had been ""tortured, starved, cut off and killed"" by Russia's president Vladimir Putin.  Navalny had been serving 19 years on extremism charges that were widely seen as politically motivated. Responding to the arrest warrant against her, Yulia Navalnaya posted on X: ""When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal. ""His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cosy cell with a TV, but in Russia - in the same colony and the same two-by-three-metre cell in which he killed Alexei."" The Moscow court ruled that Ms Navalnaya, who has vowed to continue the work of her husband, should be remanded in custody and she was declared wanted.   The decision means she would face arrest if she set foot in Russia.  The charges may be linked to a Moscow court ruling in June 2021 which outlawed three organisations linked to Navalny, labelling them ""extremists"".  Ms Navalnaya was unable to attend his funeral in March.  She has since met a number of Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden.  This month, she was elected to chair the US-based Human Rights Foundation - a non-profit organisation working to promote and protect human rights across the world.  She said she would use her role to step up the struggle her husband fought against Mr Putin.

202,"Israeli strike on Gaza camp kills 29 and injures dozens, hospital says","At least 29 Palestinians have been killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on a camp for displaced people outside a school in southern Gaza, hospital officials say. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said the strike had hit next to the gate of al-Awda school in the town of Abasan al-Kabira, east of the city of Khan Younis, and put the initial death toll at 25. One video showed more than a dozen dead and seriously wounded people, including several children, on the floor of a local hospital. The Israeli military said it had used ""precise munition"" to target a ""terrorist from Hamas' military wing"" who, it said, had taken part in the 7 October attack on Israel. It said it was ""looking into the reports that civilians were harmed"" ""adjacent"" to al-Awda school. The incident comes a week after the Israeli military ordered civilians to evacuate Abasan al-Kabira and other areas of eastern Khan Younis, prompting tens of thousands to flee. One source at the Nasser hospital, where the injured from Abasan al-Kabira were taken, said they expected the number of dead to increase.  Al-Awda school houses displaced people from the eastern villages of Khan Younis. The attack resulted in widespread destruction and the deaths of women and children. Body parts were scattered across the site and many people staying in tents outside the school were also injured. This is the fourth attack on or near to schools sheltering displaced people in the past four days.  The Israeli military said it had carried out the first three strikes because Hamas politicians, police officers and fighters were using them as bases: The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 38,240 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880k3930rmo,"David Gritten,",2024-07-09 22:22:34,
201,US blocks British court from British territory,"The US government has blocked a British court hearing from taking place on a British territory, citing security concerns, according to official documents. The supreme court of British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) was due to hold a hearing this week, attended by the BBC, on whether a group of migrants was being unlawfully detained on the island of Diego Garcia. The island hosts a secretive UK-US military base and access is heavily restricted. The US last week said it was “withdrawing its consent” for lawyers representing the migrants and “members of the press” - the BBC - to access the island, according to official communications we have seen. It said it would not allow participants of the hearing to board US military flights to Diego Garcia and would not provide “housing, transportation, and food for the visit”. The US said it would be “willing to reconsider” if the visit was “conducted in a manner” that addressed its “security and operational concerns”. Dozens of migrants arrived on the island in October 2021, saying they had been fleeing persecution and trying to sail to Canada to claim asylum when their boat ran into trouble near Diego Garcia. Late last Thursday night - hours before the judge, UK government lawyers and those representing the migrants, and the BBC were due to board flights for the first leg of the journey - the court shared an order cancelling the hearing. The US security concerns relate to a site visit that had been scheduled to take place on the island as part of the hearing, which was to include the migrant camp and several other areas of Diego Garcia. In a communication on 3 July, entitled “United States Notification to the United Kingdom of denial of the 6-12 July 2024 visit by of [sic] the Biot Supreme Court to Diego Garcia”, US authorities said the site visit presented “risks to the security and effective operation” of the base.  It had previously said it was willing to allow access to areas including the migrant camp, beaches around it and a chapel where children receive schooling.  But it had said it would not provide access to areas “open to civilian contractors and other non-military personnel”, such as a movie theatre, a barber and a bowling centre, the airport terminal and “all US-controlled areas occupied by the Biot administration, the Royal Overseas Police, and the Royal Navy”. Court documents filed on behalf of Biot’s commissioner state that the reasons for the island's US military commander's decision were “confidential and based on the US’s assessment of its own national security needs”. Tom Short, a lawyer from the UK firm Leigh Day which is representing some of the migrants, said the cancellation of this week’s hearing had been “a devastating blow to our vulnerable clients”, and called for it to be rearranged as soon as possible. “Our clients have ceded to US demands that the site visit exclude certain US-controlled buildings (such as the gym and swimming pool where US cheerleaders and celebrity chefs visited earlier this year) as well as facilities such as the Turner Club and Golf Club (which Biot and FCDO civil servants frequent).  “It is of paramount importance to our clients that the Judge see the detention camp and that they attend a hearing in person,” he added. A virtual court hearing on Tuesday, attended by lawyers in London and the migrants in Diego Garcia, sought to determine the next steps in the case as discussions between the UK and US governments continue. Speaking after the hearing, migrants told the BBC of their disappointment at this week’s hearing being cancelled. “It has taken away all our hope,” one woman said. “We have been stuck in this place for almost three years. We were hoping that this hearing would provide us some relief.” The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965. It went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the military base. Agreements signed in 1966 allowed for an initial 50-year period of US use of the territory, plus a further 20 years. The agreement was then “rolled over” in 2016, and is now set to expire in 2036, according to the Biot website. Biot is administered from London but is described as being ""constitutionally distinct” from the UK. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains that the islands are its own and the United Nations' highest court has ruled that the UK's administration of the territory is ""unlawful"" and must end. Most personnel and resources on Diego Garcia are under the control of the US, including the majority of the accommodation and transport on the island as well as restaurants and shops. The US military commander can refuse access to areas operated or controlled by the US military for security reasons. In a witness statement, Biot’s deputy commissioner, Nishi Dholakia, said it was not possible to “make alternative arrangements to replace the logistical support which the US was due to provide” in time for the scheduled court hearing this week. The room where the hearing had been scheduled to take place was only usable with US co-operation, he said.  Biot's official website states access to the island is only permitted to “those with connections either to the military facility or to the Territory’s Administration”. Diego Garcia has been described as an important strategic base for the US. Earlier this year, two B-52 bombers were sent there for training exercises.  In recent decades, US planes have been sent from the base to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq. The UK government has confirmed that rendition flights landed on the territory in 2002 to refuel there, though former CIA director Michael Hayden has denied reports that it has ever been used to house and interrogate terror suspects. The dozens of Sri Lankan Tamils who landed on the island in October 2021 are the first people to file asylum claims on Biot. About 60 people, including at least 16 children, remain there - guarded by private security company G4S - as complex legal battles are fought over their fate. This week’s hearing was due to be the first time that they would meet their lawyers in person. There have been multiple suicide attempts on the island, and reports of sexual harassment and assaults allegedly committed by migrants within the camp. Some migrants have been flown to Rwanda for medical treatment following self-harm and suicide attempts, and those with successful claims are waiting for a “safe third country” to be identified to resettle them in. United Nations representatives visited the camp late last year and reported that conditions there amounted to arbitrary detention. During Tuesday’s virtual hearing, one of the migrants on the island collapsed multiple times. The Foreign Office has previously told the BBC that the island is not suitable for migrants to live on and that it is “working tirelessly to process the migrants' claims for protection and to find a suitable third country for those whose claims are upheld”. “At all times, the welfare and safety of migrants on Biot has been our top priority,” it said earlier this year.

200,Elephants trample Spanish man to death in S Africa,"A Spanish tourist has been trampled to death by elephants after climbing out of his car to take photos of the herd at a game reserve in South Africa. The unnamed 43-year-old man was visiting Pilanesberg National Park on Sunday morning with his fiancee and two other people when the attack happened, according to police. The group had been driving around in their own vehicle before spotting three elephants with three calves, officers said. Once the man got out of the car and walked towards the herd, the matriarch became ""agitated"" and charged at him, said Pieter Nel, a spokesman for the local tourism board. Unable to escape, the man was then trampled on by the rest of the herd. Local media report that the man was taken to hospital but died of his injuries.  The group of people he was visiting the park with - all residents of Johannesburg - were unharmed, say police. The force says an investigation is now under way. South Africa's national parks attract more than a million visitors each year. Officials say it is crucial that visitors follow safety precautions. ""Tourists are constantly reminded about the importance of staying inside their vehicles when visiting the park, and to keep a good distance between animals and their vehicles and give animals a chance to move freely, and to only get out of vehicles in safely designated areas,"" said Thami Matshego, chief executive officer of the North West Parks and Tourism Board, speaking to local news outlet Netwerk24. It was ""normal behaviour"" for wild elephants to defend their young, said Mr Nel, of the same tourism body. ""Despite warnings from his fellow passengers and occupants from two other vehicles that were at the sighting, he [the deceased] unfortunately did not heed their warnings,"" he added. Elephant attacks are not uncommon. Earlier this year, an 80-year-old woman from the US was killed by an elephant that charged at her safari vehicle in Zambia. In 2019, a suspected rhino poacher was trampled on by an elephant then eaten by a pride of lions in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

199,Europe's Ariane-6 rocket blasts off in maiden flight,"Europe's big new rocket, Ariane-6, has blasted off successfully on its maiden flight. The vehicle set off from a launchpad in French Guiana about 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on a demonstration mission to put a clutch of satellites in orbit. Crews on the ground in Kourou applauded as the rocket soared into the sky.  Developed at a cost of €4bn (£3.4bn), Ariane-6 is intended to be a workhorse rocket that gives European governments and companies access to space independently from the rest of the world. It already has a backlog of launch contracts, but there are worries its design could limit future prospects. Like its predecessor, Ariane-5, the new model is expendable - a new rocket is needed for every mission, whereas the latest American vehicles are being built to be wholly or partially reusable. Nonetheless, European space officials believe Ariane-6 can carve out a niche for itself. ""This is a big moment,"" said European Space Agency (Esa) director-general Josef Aschbacher. ""Daily life today really depends on information from satellites, from telecommunications and Earth observation to weather forecasting and disaster management. It is unimaginable for Europe not to have guaranteed, independent access to space,"" he told BBC News. On the surface, the 6 looks very similar to the old 5, but under the skin it harnesses state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques (3D printing, friction stir welding, augmented reality design, etc) that should result in faster and cheaper production. Ariane-6 will operate in two configurations: The core stage is supplemented with a second, or upper, stage that will place the payloads in their precise orbits high above the Earth. This stage can be stopped and restarted multiple times, which is useful when launching large batches of satellites into a constellation, or network. The reignition capability also enables the stage to pull itself back down to Earth, so it won't become a piece of lingering space junk. Tuesday's mission used the Ariane-62 variant. The rocket will ascend to an altitude of 580km before starting to offload free-flying payloads. These are a mix of university and commercial spacecraft. They include two capsules that will endeavour to survive a fiery fall through the atmosphere to splash down in the Pacific. One of the capsules, which goes by the name of Nyx Bikini, is a small-scale demonstrator from a Franco-German company which aims eventually to develop spacecraft that can transport supplies and people to and from space stations in Earth orbit. Inaugural flights are always occasions of high jeopardy. It's not uncommon for a new rocket design to have a failure. Ariane-5 famously blew itself apart 37 seconds after leaving the ground on its debut in 1996. The loss was put down to an error in control software. But a revised rocket then came back to dominate the commercial launch market for the world's biggest satellites. That dominance was only broken in the 2010s by US entrepreneur Elon Musk and his reusable Falcon-9 rockets. Falcon flight rates and prices undercut the competitiveness of Ariane-5. Europe is moving towards reusability, but the necessary technologies will not be in service until the 2030s. And in the meantime, Mr Musk is introducing even bigger rockets that promise to reduce launch costs still further. Ariane-6 enters a very challenging environment, therefore. ""We can all have our own opinions. What I can just reaffirm is that we have an order book that is full,"" said Lucia Linares, who heads space transportation strategy at Esa. ""I guess the word goes here to the customers: they have said Ariane-6 is an answer to their needs."" There are launch contracts to take the rocket through its first three years of operations. These include 18 launches for another US billionaire, Jeff Bezos, who wants to establish a constellation of internet satellites he calls Kuiper. European officials aim to have Ariane-6 flying roughly once a month. If this flight rate can be achieved, then the rocket should be able to establish itself, commented Pierre Lionnet from space consultancy ASD Eurospace. ""First, we need to ensure that there is sufficient demand from European customers - the European institutional ones. Then Ariane needs to win just a few commercial customers beyond Kuiper. This would give it a market,"" he told BBC News. ""But it's a matter of pricing. If Falcon-9 is systematically undercutting the price offer  of Ariane-6, there will be an issue."" Ariane-6 is a project of 13 member states of Esa, led by France (56%) and Germany (21%). The 13 partners have promised subsidy payments of up to €340m (£295m) a year to support the early phase of Ariane-6 exploitation. The UK was a leading player right at the beginning of Europe's launcher programme and remains an Esa member state, but its direct involvement in Ariane ended when the Ariane-4 model was retired, in 2003. A few UK companies continue to supply components on a commercial basis, and some spacecraft built in Britain will undoubtedly continue to fly on Ariane.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19km33k1mpo,"Jonathan Amos,",2024-07-09 20:11:34,
198,Weinstein faces new sex assault investigation in NY,"Harvey Weinstein is being investigated for ""additional violent sexual assaults"" months after a previous conviction in New York was overturned, a court in Manhattan has heard. Nicole Blumberg, an assistant district attorney, told Tuesday's hearing that the alleged assaults fell within the statute of limitations, but did not say when prosecutors would be ready to press any fresh charges. The disgraced film mogul, 72, is already facing a retrial after his 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned in April on the basis that it was unfair. ""As we said in 2020, there were women who were not ready to proceed with the legal process. Some of those women are now ready to proceed,"" Ms Blumberg told Tuesday's hearing.  Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala told the hearing that the new investigations were a delay tactic, adding: ""Once again we have a hotline: 1-800 Get Harvey."" Mr Aidala added that his client was suffering from a host of medical problems while being held in solitary confinement at New York's Rikers Island jail. Weinstein was brought into court on Tuesday with his left hand cuffed to his wheelchair. Weinstein's 2020 conviction was crucial for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in the media of sexual misconduct. The Miramax film studio founder was sentenced to 23 years in prison for sexually assaulting production assistant Miriam Haley and raping actress Jessica Mann. However, the New York Court of Appeals in April found evidence presented about Weinstein's ""prior bad acts"" from three witnesses unconnected to the charges against him violated the right to a fair trial.  Members of the #MeToo movement described the decision as ""profoundly unjust"", while lawyers for his victims said the decision to retry was a ""leap backwards"" and ""tragic"". A retrial has been scheduled to begin after the Labour Day holiday on 2 September, although no specific date has been set. Ms Blumberg said on Tuesday  that prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November. Weinstein was also convicted  to 16 years following a separate rape trial in California. That conviction was not affected by the New York appeal court's decision, and he has not begun serving the California sentence. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He denies all charges against him. ",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjk3jy3vyk5o,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-09 19:11:34,
197,Gladiator II: Paul Mescal battles a rhino in upcoming film,"The trailer for Ridley Scott's sequel to Gladiator has dropped, showcasing several epic scenes, including a water battle in Rome's Colosseum and Paul Mescal being rammed by a rhino.  All Of Us Strangers star Mescal plays Lucius, fighting for his life as a gladiator, despite his high status as nephew of corrupt former Emperor Commodus.  Sir Ridley's first film in 2000, which starred Russell Crowe as soldier-turned-gladiator Maximus, won five Oscars including best actor. The trailer opens as Lucius recalls his childhood memory, when ex-Roman commander Maximus battled his uncle in the arena. ""I remember that day. I never forgot it, that a slave could take revenge against an emperor,"" Lucius says, before we see him in a flashback from the first film, being dragged to safety by his mother.  Here's a quick recap of the first Gladiator film: the plot revolves around upstanding Roman general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, who was asked to inherit the role of emperor from ailing Marcus Aurelius.  But Commodus murdered the emperor and took the title, before killing Maximus' family and leaving him a slave. Maximus rose up to become a gladiator, returning to Rome in order to exact his revenge.  World History Encyclopedia describes gladiatorial contests as ""bloody entertainment... an opportunity for emperors to display their wealth"", where up to 50,000 spectators enjoyed ""contests which were literally a matter of life and death"".  Some battles included wild animals - Gladiator featured tigers in the arena, while an angry-looking rhino with a bloodied horn charges at Mescal in the sequel.  It's fair to say the first film caused a flurry of excitement among admirers of Crowe's powerful portrayal of Maximus.  Given Mescal enjoyed a huge surge in his fanbase after he starred in BBC drama Normal People, it's possible his role in Gladiator II may have a similar impact.   Lucius is undoubtedly reminiscent of the honourable Maximus, battling from below while having a much higher purpose.  In the sequel, Lucius has been captured from his home far from Rome, and brought there as a prisoner. He becomes a gladiator, working for Macrinus, played by Denzel Washington, who sponsors fighters much like Oliver Reed's Proximo did in the first film.  Lucius protects his birthright, saying he doesn't know where he was born, adding: ""I never knew a mother and or father."" ""You will be my instrument,"" Macrinus responds.  It appears that the twin emperors now in place -  played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger - are also corrupt. We see them laugh demonically while gladiators die in their mock water battle (which did happen in real life).  Lucius's mother, Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen in the original film as well, watches with horror while her son fights beneath her, although we don't know if she recognises him.   However we see her take him full circle, back to Maximus, by giving him a ring which belonged to the Roman general before he died. Like the original, the film appears to be about the corruption of power, with worthy, embattled individuals taking on the might of Rome's rulers. Lucius favours ""strength and honour"", while another Roman general, Marcus Acacius, played by The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal, says: ""I will not waste another generation of young men for their vanity,"" alongside footage of the emperors.  We don't yet know enough about Pascal's character to know where his morals fully lie.  The trailer ends with Mescal and Pascal battling in the arena, with the gladiator looking like he has the advantage, as he holds two swords crossed over the army general's neck.  Initial responses on X were a mixture of both positive and negative, with some people excited for the sequel, while others said it wouldn't be as good as the original. Some fans spotted what looked like sharks in the water battle, with filmmaker Kyle Prohaska saying: ""I'm all in on Gladiator II. I'll go just for some of those insane sequences. Sharks in the arena? A rhino? Denzel? Come on. This is definitely one of those sequels nobody asked for, but this one looks better than most."" Another post, from a user called @FilmmakerJeff, called the trailer ""underwhelming"". ""I hate to report that I’m not a fan of the Gladiator II trailer,"" he said.  ""Terrible music choice, nothing from it gave me reassurance that it could be even close to as good as the original, and honestly, it looks like it could be pretty good at best. My hype meter dropped a notch.""  There was also disagreement on social media over the soundtrack, which was No Church in the Wild, by Jay-Z and Kanye West.  One user wrote: ""In what world does the sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator need Jay-Z and Kanye West? Stop shoehorning songs into trailers."" Another in favour though, wrote: ""That pounding hip-hop really works on the Gladiator 2 trailer. Fits so well to the era."" Sir Ridley, who made 2023's epic Oscar and Bafta-nominated film Napoleon, told Deadline last year that he made Gladiator II because ""economically, it makes sense...  ""I thought the [first] film was, as it were, completely satisfactory, creatively complete, so why muck with it, right?  ""But these cycles keep going on and on and on, they repeat globally for the last 20 years. It started to spell itself out as an obvious thing to do, and that’s how it evolved."" Gladiator II is released in UK cinemas in November.",2024-07-09 23:11:34,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czk0d90p84mo,"Helen Bushby,",2024-07-09 17:11:34,
217,What to know as Alec Baldwin's Rust shooting trial begins,"A jury has been picked to hear the trial of Alec Baldwin for a fatal shooting on a film set in New Mexico.  Mr Baldwin, 66, faces an involuntary manslaughter charge, which he denies, in the October 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.  The 42-year-old was killed after a gun Mr Baldwin was using in a scene rehearsal for  the movie Rust went off. A bullet from the gun fatally struck the cinematographer and wounded director Joel Souza. The 12 jurors and four alternates who will decide the case were selected on Tuesday after prosecutors and Mr Baldwin's attorneys questioned them about everything from their political affiliation to their knowledge of the case.  Opening statements are set to begin in the Santa Fe, New Mexico, court on Wednesday morning.  Mr Baldwin - best known for playing Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock and for portraying Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live - was joined in court by family including his wife, Hilaria. He has pleaded not guilty to the felony charge.  He maintains that he did not pull the trigger, and says the gun went off when he cocked the revolver's hammer. His defence team argues that it was the responsibility of other crew members to ensure the gun was safe. But prosecutors have called this claim ""absurd"", alleging that the actor did not share this information when first interviewed after the shooting and argued he had a responsibility to follow basic gun safety. In October 2021, Mr Baldwin, was rehearsing on the set of the Western near Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was practising a cross-body draw of the gun, as the director called for him to point it at the camera in an upcoming scene.  Mr Baldwin -  who boasts a 40-year acting career - had a starring role in the film, which he was also co-producing. He was portraying an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter.  As he pointed the revolver during the rehearsal, it went off. A bullet from the weapon hit Ms Hutchins in the chest, also striking director Joel Souza in the shoulder. Ms Hutchins was flown to hospital by helicopter but died of her injuries. Mr Souza was taken by ambulance from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch. Court documents show that Mr Baldwin and others on set did not know the gun was loaded or that it contained live ammunition.  It was discovered later that the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, brought a box of live bullets to the film set from her California home. Prosecutors said those live rounds slowly spread through the set over the course of 12 days. Gutierrez-Reed, who loaded the gun for Mr Baldwin before the shooting, was charged and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Ms Hutchins' death. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison - the maximum sentence.  Judge Mary Sommers, who oversaw the case, said Gutierrez-Reed's mistake had cost Ms Hutchins her life by turning ""a safe weapon into a lethal weapon"". David Halls, an assistant director and safety co-ordinator, has also pleaded guilty to unsafe handling of a firearm. One of the key questions in the case is this: did Mr Baldwin pull the trigger or did the gun malfunction? Several weeks after the fatal shooting, Mr Baldwin told ABC News in a high-profile interview that he did not pull the trigger.  Legal experts say this has forced the actor into a much narrower defence, as he cannot allege that he did not remember what occurred or that it happened by accident.  Prosecutors, meanwhile, have painted Mr Baldwin as an unsafe firearm handler, showing footage of him waving around weapons on set and saying in filings that he was unable to control his emotions.  They also cited an FBI report that tested Mr Baldwin's claim. It found that the gun's ""trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer"".  During the analysis of the weapon in 2022, an FBI examiner took a mallet to the weapon and broke its internal components. Mr Baldwin's lawyers have called this ""outrageous"" and argued the destroyed weapon deprived the defence of a full opportunity to examine the gun in its original condition. But a judge denied a last-ditch effort to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge. Tre Lovell, a trial lawyer in California, says prosecutors will argue that even though Mr Baldwin was on a film set, it does not alleviate him from basic gun-handling skills and safety duties. They will argue that anybody who holds a gun, whether on a film set or in real life, has an obligation to never point it at someone and to ensure it is not loaded with live rounds. Prosecutors attempted to argue during a pre-trial hearing that Mr Baldwin had greater safety responsibilities on set as a producer, but Judge Sommer sided with the defence and said this was irrelevant to the case.  That means Mr Baldwin's role as producer - a credit given for raising money, creative input, or physical production work - will not be included in the trial.  But his defence team still has much work ahead to win its case, Mr Lovell says, as it will need to help the jury understand a film set - a space in which people have designated roles and obligations. “They need to show the jury that once you start imposing a duty on an actor to ensure that a prop is safe, set will go into chaos,” he said.  ""There's no evidence that he [Baldwin] would have even known the difference between the dummy bullet and a real bullet."" Mr Baldwin's legal team will also likely argue that the actor should have been able to rely on the film's armourer and safety coordinator - Gutierrez-Reed and Halls, respectively - to ensure he could perform his job without worry.  Mr Baldwin is not currently scheduled to testify at the trial, but that does not mean it will not happen.  Most legal experts agree there are very few reasons to have a defendant testify at any trial because it allows prosecutors the chance to cross-examine them.  Mr Baldwin's defence team can wait until towards the end of the trial to make a decision based on how the proceedings have gone. The trial is scheduled to last 10 days.  Gutierrez-Reed did not testify during her trial. Mr Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison due to the charges related to Ms Hutchins' death.  Gutierrez-Reed, who faced the same charge in the fatal shooting, received the maximum sentence.  But even if the jury finds Mr Baldwin not guilty, his legal troubles will not be over.  He faces several civil lawsuits, including one brought by Ms Hutchins's family.  In a negligence legal action, they claim the cinematographer's death and other injuries and fatalities were ""a likely result"" on a movie set that contained guns, live ammunition and the actor ""inexplicably"" pointing and firing a gun at Ms Hutchins. Mr Baldwin has said in recent court filings that he has struggled to find acting work since the incident.  In May, the actor and his wife Hilaria announced that they and their seven children would star in a reality show next year.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz47qr0z17lo,"Emma Vardy, Samantha Granville and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-09 22:58:35,

214,Democrats look to Kamala Harris - but could she beat Trump?,"On Saturday afternoon, US Vice-President Kamala Harris sat on stage at a black cultural festival in New Orleans, talking about her life story and what she felt she had achieved in the White House. It was the kind of event that the first female, black and South Asian American vice-president has regularly attended throughout her three-and-a-half years as Joe Biden’s deputy, usually trailed by a small press pack dwarfed by that which follows the president himself. But as panicked Democrats a thousand miles away in Washington weighed replacing 81-year-old Joe Biden as the party’s candidate for November’s election following his woeful and sometimes incomprehensible debate performance against Donald Trump, the number of reporters trailing Ms Harris had swelled to dozens. On stage and through her travels this weekend, the vice-president did not address swirling questions about Mr Biden’s fitness for office and whether he should withdraw and hand the baton to her. But in discussing ambition and how to forge your own path with her audience in New Orleans, she encouraged the crowd not to listen to naysayers. “People in your life will tell you, though, it’s not your time. It’s not your turn. Nobody like you has done it before,"" she said. ""Don’t you ever listen to that."" Since the disastrous CNN debate on 27 June, she has repeatedly defended her boss, arguing that his record as president shouldn’t be outweighed by 90 minutes on a debate stage. Mr Biden himself has struck a defiant tone and fiercely insisted that he will remain the nominee. Yet as calls grow louder for the president to step aside, some high-profile Democrats are unifying behind 59-year-old Ms Harris as the natural candidate to replace him. On Sunday, congressman Adam Schiff of California told NBC's Meet The Press that either Mr Biden had to be able to “win overwhelmingly or he has to pass the torch to someone who can”. Kamala Harris, he added, could “very well win overwhelmingly” against Trump. That’s a proposition that has raised eyebrows among some Democrats, including Biden allies, who see in Ms Harris a vice-president who failed in her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination before the first ballot was even cast and who has struggled with an uneven record and low approval ratings throughout her time in the White House. Against that, senior Democratic lawmakers like Mr Schiff and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn have been floating Ms Harris as the obvious successor should Mr Biden ultimately bow to party pressure. Supporters point to a handful of polls that suggest she would perform better than the president in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump, and they argue she has the national profile, campaign infrastructure and appeal to younger voters that could make the transition seamless four months before election day. An elevation to the top of the ticket would be a remarkable turnaround for a woman not long ago seen as a political weakness by senior figures in the Biden White House. Even Mr Biden himself reportedly described her as a “work in progress"" during their first months in office. But Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist and Harris’s former communications director, said she had long been underestimated. “Whether she’s a partner to the president or she has to lead the ticket, she is somebody who Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,” Mr Simmons told the BBC. Since the debate and its fall-out, Ms Harris has altered her schedule to stick close to the president. She appeared at a heavily-scrutinised meeting last Wednesday where Mr Biden sought to reassure powerful Democratic governors about his fitness for office. And a day later, on the Fourth of July - America’s Independence Day - she abandoned her usual tradition of grilling hotdogs for firefighters and Secret Service agents at her Los Angeles home to be by Mr Biden’s side at the White House celebrations. The former top prosecutor has focused on criticising Trump in public appearances since the debate, pressing the case as to why voters should believe he is a threat to democracy and women’s rights. At the same time, she has offered nothing but steadfast support for Mr Biden. Vice-presidents always need to strike a delicate balancing act between ambition and loyalty, but Ms Harris knows that this is not a moment where she can show any daylight between her and the president. Kamala Harris is, however, far from the only alternative to Mr Biden being discussed. The list of potential Biden replacements ranges from a cadre of popular governors - Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Illinois’ JB Pritzker - to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California congressman Ro Khanna. Ms Harris and her staff have refused to engage in public speculation. But her team is keenly aware of the behind-the-scenes conversations taking place as some party members coalesce behind her. A memo circulated online, purportedly written by Democratic operatives, laid out a detailed argument to promote Ms Harris despite her “real political weaknesses”. Trying to choose anyone other than her would throw the campaign into disarray and keep ""Democratic bickering"" in the media spotlight for months, it argues. If Mr Biden were to give up the nomination, the idea of the Democrats passing over Ms Harris in favour of another candidate appalls many on the left of the party and in its powerful black caucus. In that situation, ""this party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms Harris"", Mr Clyburn, one of the most prominent black lawmakers in Congress, told MSNBC last week. Republicans, too, have acknowledged Ms Harris would be the frontrunner to replace Mr Biden. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned on Sunday that Republicans must be ready for a “dramatically different race” should Ms Harris - whom he described as a “vigorous” candidate - become the nominee. Mr Graham emphasised her progressive California brand, suggesting she was closer in policy terms to left-wing firebrand Bernie Sanders than Joe Biden, in what appeared to be a glimpse of a Republican attack line should she become the candidate. For his part, Donald Trump has called her “pathetic” in the days since the debate. But ultimately the only question that matters for many Democrats - including deep-pocketed donors - is if she has a better chance of beating Trump than Joe Biden does. And that is deeply uncertain. Harris backers point to a recent CNN poll suggesting she would fare better than the president against Trump in November. In a head-to-head contest, Ms Harris trailed the Republican by only two points, while Mr Biden lagged six points behind him. The poll also suggested Ms Harris performed better than Mr Biden with independent voters and women. But many polling experts dismiss such hypothetical surveys, noting voter sentiment would change if Mr Biden actually decided to step aside and the Democrats entertained other potential candidates. One Democratic pollster close to the Biden campaign acknowledged that Ms Harris may have more potential to expand the party’s voter base than the president, but was sceptical about how much of a difference she would make. Surveys pitting her against Trump at this stage “don’t mean anything”, said the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Ms Harris, the child of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, performs better in surveys than Mr Biden with black, Latino and young voters - critical constituencies that allies say she could energise as the nominee. But whether she would actually boost turnout among younger voters of colour is another uncertain question. “This is just a wait and see moment,” the pollster said. Some in the party are also asking whether Ms Harris’ progressive reputation risks losing the union and blue-collar voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that Mr Biden narrowly won in 2020 and which both parties need to secure a win in November. Should she take over the ticket, some Democrats have suggested that Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina could be picked as running mate to capture centrist voters in Midwestern states. Given the ages of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, voters are paying far more attention to the VP candidate of both parties in this election cycle, said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked for the 2020 Biden campaign. On the Republican side, Trump has yet to announce his running mate, although many speculate he’ll pick North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum or Ohio Senator JD Vance. Deep concerns among some Democrats about Harris's strength as a presidential candidate date back to her unsuccesful 2020 bid for the party's nomination, in which she landed blows on Mr Biden in an early debate but then crashed out before the first caucuses in Iowa. Critics said she struggled to define herself as a candidate, a sentiment that has lingered throughout her tenure as vice-president. She had a shaky start in the White House, marked by high-profile interview slip-ups, low approval ratings and staff turnover. She was also tasked with overseeing the administration’s strategy to reduce migration over the US southern border, which increased to record levels over the last three years and remains a major vulnerability for the campaign. Those early stumbles led Ms Harris to be more cautious about her public appearances but many voters perceive her as ineffective and absent. “People need to know more about her, what economic issues she is strong on and they need to be reminded of the role she’s played,” Ms Lake said. Over the last year, Ms Harris has found stable footing as the administration’s leading voice on abortion rights, an issue that proved successful for Democrats during the 2022 midterm elections and one the party hopes will win back more voters in November. As a former prosecutor who handled sexual violence cases, she has invoked personal stories of working with women who miscarried in the bathroom or were turned away at hospitals as she’s tried to mobilise voters around the issue. On the campaign trail, she has also sought to capitalise on other issues that resonate with young voters, including student debt forgiveness, climate change and gun violence. The White House, too, has made a concerted effort to promote her more forcefully. Still, she faces an uphill battle to change longstanding voter scepticism - her approval ratings hover around 37% in polling averages compiled by FiveThirtyEight - a level similar to both Mr Biden and Trump. And unless Mr Biden himself caves to the mounting party pressure to step down, grassroots Democratic supporters themselves seem resigned to supporting the current ticket. At the Essence festival in New Orleans, Iam Christian Tucker, a 41-year-old small business owner from New Orleans, said she didn’t care, ultimately, who the nominee was. She said she liked Kamala Harris, but she wasn’t sure if a black female president could win election. “I’m voting against Donald Trump more than anything,” she told the BBC. Greg Hovel, 67, who attended a rally for President Biden in Madison, Wisconsin, last week, said he supported Ms Harris in the 2020 primary and “has always been a fan,” though he cautioned there is “a lot of anti-woman sentiment in this country.” “I think she would make an excellent president,” Mr Hovel said. “But I still think Biden can win.” Mike Wendling contributed to this report from Madison, Wisconsin  BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

213,What to expect from Iran's new president,"Iran’s president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian stood as a wildcard candidate, and defied expectations to win the presidency against hardline rival Saeed Jalili. Mr Pezeshkian is notable because he is ""a reformist"". But not the liberal-minded, democracy-loving kind of reformist, in the universal sense. In Iran, ""the reformists"" are one ideological faction of the Islamic Republic's ruling elite.  They are Islamists, like their conservative rivals, but believe a more moderate version of the regime’s ideology could better serve both the ruling clergy and Iranian society. Reformists led the administration from 1997 until 2005 and were part of a de facto coalition when Hassan Rouhani, a conservative who became a centrist, was president between 2013 and 2021. They have often called for a freer and more democratic society. But in the 2024 election, unlike the previous reformist administration in the late 1990s, promises for a freer and more democratic society were not part of their campaign. Since the 1990s, Iran has experienced multiple waves of dissent and oppression. Even reformists themselves have faced severe political crackdowns, with many high-profile figures spending time in jail over the last two decades. Though members of the establishment, It is widely acknowledged that they lack influence over crucial centres of power, such as the Supreme Leader’s Office, the Guardian Council, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and the Supreme National Security Council. When hardline former president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May and Mr Pezeshkian prepared his presidential campaign, he chose a strategy very similar to Hassan Rouhani’s in 2013: focusing on the economic hardship the country has been facing for years due to Western sanctions - and blaming their conservative rivals for causing this situation with their “radical” anti-West stances.  As part of his campaign, Mr Pezeshkian recruited Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s former foreign minister who helped strike the nuclear deal in 2015. Although Mr Zarif is not a reformist per se, he campaigned heavily for Mr Pezeshkian. In his manifesto, Mr Pezeshkian declared that his foreign policy would be “not anti-West, nor anti-East.” He criticised former president Raisi’s policies of moving the country closer to Russia and China and insisted that the only way to resolve the economic crisis is through negotiations with the West to end the nuclear standoff and ease the sanctions.  However, during the campaign, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised these ideas. Mr Khamenei called those who believe in achieving prosperity through friendlier relations with the US “deluded,” - pointing to the fact that it was the US, not Iran, that withdrew from the nuclear deal. According to the Iranian constitution, Mr Khamenei is the main decision-maker; an 85-year-old Shia cleric who was a revolutionary in 1979 and climbed the power ladder to become the head of state in 1989. He is known for his ideological animosity towards Israel and the United States, his deep distrust of the West, and in the last two decades, his active support for a doctrine called “look to the East,” which means ending the old non-aligned policy and leaning towards China and Russia on the global stage. One of the most important aspects of Iran’s policies in the region is what the Quds Force (the external arm of the IRGC) does. The president does not have any direct control over them, and only the Supreme Leader can decide their actions. Mr Khamenei repeatedly – including just three days before the first round of this election – stated that what the Quds Force does is essential for the country’s security doctrine. So when Mr Pezeshkian talks about a different foreign policy with a friendlier approach to the West, the chance of changes in Iran’s activities in countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen are slim. Nevertheless, the president is the highest-ranking Iranian diplomat, and the foreign ministry can still help shape and implement policy. They have the opportunity to push for their vision through behind-the-door political lobbying, as happened in 2015 when then-centrist President Hassan Rouhani convinced the hardliners, including Mr Khamenei himself, to accept the deal. Moreover, the administration could significantly impact public discourse and promote policies that might not fully align with Mr Khamenei’s stance. Such nuances are the reformists' only hope to do what they promised and bring down what Mr Pezeshkian called the “walls that have been built around the country by the hardliners.”",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05x9lw3zwo,"Kayvan Hosseini,",2024-07-09 05:11:35,
216,Indian wrestlers eye Olympics after sex harassment scandal,"Over a year after protests against sexual harassment allegations shook Indian wrestling, female athletes are gearing up for major events, including the 2024 Paris Olympics. The BBC spoke to young wrestlers about their journey. Reetika Hooda almost didn't make it. The 23-year-old is among the five Indian women wrestlers to qualify for the Olympics this year. It’s a hard-won opportunity, following a year of setbacks that shook her confidence. She knew she needed more training and competitions to improve her game. A year ago, all wrestling came to a halt in India after its federation chief Brij Bhushan Singh was accused of sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations. India’s sports ministry did not sack Singh but it disbanded the federation after finding several lapses, including the non-compliance of sexual harassment laws, and set up a temporary team to run things. It was an unprecedented time. Hooda remembers watching the country’s most accomplished wrestlers, including her inspiration Sakshi Malik - the only Indian woman to win an Olympic medal in wrestling - camp on the roads of Delhi, demanding Singh’s resignation. The protest made headlines globally, especially after the police detained the wrestlers when they tried to march to India's new parliament building. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) condemned the way the wrestlers were treated and called for an impartial inquiry into their complaints. “It was sad - not only because of what was happening but also what wasn’t,” Hooda told me. Each year, the International Olympic Committee designates certain tournaments as qualification events for the games. To compete, wrestlers must earn ranking points in trials, win national competitions, and secure the Wrestling Federation of India's (WFI) approval. But instead of competing, Hooda stared at an empty sporting calendar for weeks. “We trained but there were no trials, which meant we could not compete and know our shortcomings. There was a constant fear that we won’t be prepared [for the Olympics],” she said. For a country that’s won only 24 medals at individual events in Olympics, with over a quarter in wrestling, this was worrying. Fresh elections to the WFI were finally held in December 2023, nearly a year after the protests began. The wrestlers had asked India's sports minister to prevent people associated with Singh from participating in the election. Singh did not contest as he had already served the maximum of three terms. But his close aide Sanjay Singh was elected the chief after a landslide victory. This sparked outrage among women wrestlers. On the same day, Olympic medallist Malik quit the sport in protest. “Even now I get emotional when I think of that moment,” Malik said. “Wrestling took me to such heights, got me love and respect, and I had to give it up.” Young wrestlers were stunned by Malik’s decision – but soon, they were back on the mat. “Sakshi Malik was the reason I took up wrestling,” said Tanu Malik, a 20-year-old wrestler in Haryana state. “So when I saw her crying, I thought to myself, she fought for us, we can’t give up now.” From that day, Tanu Malik decided to work harder. Her training at the state’s all-women Yudhvir Wrestling Academy starts at 04:30. The day starts with a rigorous five-hour fitness session, lifting large truck tyres and practicing wrestling techniques. After a break for food and rest, the women resume training for another five hours in the afternoon. Girls as young as 12 years sweat it out on the mat. In their free time, they talk about  diets and share recipes that would help them stay fit. None of them want to talk about the alleged sexual harassment at academies or the accusations against the former wrestling chief. However, they are determined not to give up. Seema Kharab, a coach, says that contrary to expectations, the number of girls at the academy has not dropped since the protests. “The protests have assured young wrestlers that it is possible to raise their voice, that positive action may be taken and they can get support within the system,” she says. In June, the police charged Brij Bhushan Singh with stalking, harassment, intimidation, and making ""sexually coloured remarks"", but a court granted him bail Meanwhile, the new federation chief, Sanjay Singh, has taken on the mantle. He acknowledged his 30-year relationship with the former chief but dismissed allegations of Brij Bhushan Singh's interference, claiming wrestlers had accepted him as the new head. He said this was evident from the “massive turnout” at national wrestling competitions this year. “No-one will be favoured or discriminated against and each wrestler is dear to me. I am also the father of two daughters and I understand what daughters need,” he added. However, for young women like Tanu Malik, fear has become an inescapable part of being in the profession. “It’s not easy - my parents are constantly worried about sending me to training alone,” she says. “But they have to trust us, otherwise how would things work? It’s like accepting defeat without even fighting.” Others feel deflated and say the protests have come at a huge personal cost for them. Shiksha Kharab, a gold medallist at the Asian Championship, says it caused disruptions in training because of which young wrestlers have lost a crucial year. But Sakshi Malik has no regrets. “The most important thing is to fight,” she said. “I don’t think anybody in any sporting federation would dare to do anything, they now know that harassment can have repercussions.” Hooda says she's nervous about competing with some of the world’s biggest wrestling giants at the Games, but also looking forward to it. “Sakshi Malik used to say victory and loss are not important - just trust your hard work. That’s what I will do,” she adds. As she gets ready for training, a picture of Sakshi posing with her Olympic medal, beams down at her. “My only focus now is to win a medal” she says. “Who knows, maybe one day I will have my picture next to hers.”",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58grz0020o,"Divya Arya,",2024-07-08 23:11:35,
211,This Nato summit could save or sink Biden's candidacy,"It is a week of reckoning for Joe Biden.  Twelve days after a halting debate performance that may go down as one of the most damaging in modern American history, the president is fighting for his political survival under intense domestic and global scrutiny. This week’s Nato summit in Washington DC may be his path to at least a temporary reprieve - or this president’s last stand. In the past few days, Mr Biden has railed against his critics, claimed the mandate of Democratic primary voters and challenged opponents to step forward and try to unseat him.  He has promised repeatedly that he is moving ahead with his campaign and that the time for second-guessing and hand-wringing is over. That pressing ahead will start at the Nato summit.  Mr Biden will host alliance leaders for three days of meetings and public events culminating in a solo press conference on Thursday afternoon.  It is a stage on which Mr Biden, a man well versed in foreign relations, should be comfortable. But it also raises the already high stakes for his presidency, given that a poor showing will have international as well as domestic ramifications. A mistake could start a political stampede among Democrats that extinguishes his hopes of even making it to the November general election, let alone winning it.  It could also sharpen concerns from European allies who are concerned about the increasing likelihood of a Donald Trump presidency and the dramatic foreign policy shifts that would come with it. “Biden is entering this week diminished,” said Kristine Berzina, managing director of the German Marshall Fund Geostrategy North.  “We don’t know how he’s going to exit it.” It is understood that many European leaders are anxious about Trump and his foreign policy strategy. The former president has disparaged multilateral international alliances. Ms Berzina said that in the past two weeks, however, these leaders have been experiencing something new - Biden anxiety. After his halting debate performance, she says, American allies have begun doubting whether the president is up to the task.  Heading into the Nato summit, they are hoping to see some evidence that his performance that night was an aberration and not reflective of a new normal.  “It is worrisome to have a close ally, your most meaningful ally, falter,” said Ms Berzina.  “So I think there is tremendous hope that Biden passes the test. But if he isn’t able to deliver, it creates more questions about the US’s reliability.” Eyes will be on the US president as he attends summit sessions, hosts foreign leaders at the White House and engages in bilateral meetings with key leaders, including newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Even behind closed doors of the Nato meetings, word of Mr Biden’s performance - good or bad - is sure to leak out. Mr Biden faces an even taller task this week domestically. The president has pointed to buttressing and expanding Nato in the face of Russian aggression as one of his key accomplishments.  This is something that differentiates his leadership from Trump’s - as well as any Democrats who could potentially replace him on the ballot - and the summit will be his chance to put that on display for the American public. “Who’s going to be able to keep Nato together like me?” the president said in his interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on Friday. He added that the Nato summit would be a good way to judge his abilities. “Come listen,” he said. “See what they say.” But simply clearing low expectations at the Nato summit and the Thursday press conference may not be enough for many of the politicians, pundits and party activists who are already calling for him to step aside. “Just having some good appearances is not going to stop the questions,” said Bill Scher, a liberal pundit and editor of Washington Monthly who recently penned a column calling for Mr Biden to step aside for Vice-President Kamala Harris.  “Time was really of the essence to nip all the speculation in the bud, and they wasted a week. There is no clear path out of this situation.” Mr Scher - a longtime supporter of Mr Biden - says the president’s attempts to push back now with media interviews, letters and calls to Democratic politicians come after public sentiment has solidified against him.  And once that sentiment is fully cemented in the polls - which could take several weeks - it will probably be too late to cleanly replace him. “I understand how difficult it has to be when you’re nearing the end of your life and you’re not performing as well as you used to,” Mr Scher said. “Having to come to terms with that in public has to be excruciating.” But the data that shows Mr Biden losing support and facing defeat in November is becoming increasingly clear.  Polls indicate nearly three-quarters of Americans - and even a majority of Democrats - think the president should stand down. A half-dozen Democratic members of Congress have called for him to abandon his bid, and many others have offered only equivocal support. The president continues to say he will press ahead with his campaign, however, and he has the national convention delegates to ensure that he is the Democratic nominee. The decision lies firmly in his hands, and if he can make it through the week without a major misstep, he may, in fact, survive the immediate storm. The story of this week, however, has been set. It isn’t one of Nato celebrating its 75th year of existence and focusing on the challenges to come.  Instead, it is a narrative that could decide whether Mr Biden can politically live to fight another day.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0471nye4lko,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-09 07:11:35,
210,Modi's balancing act as he meets Putin in Moscow,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being keenly watched by his Western allies as he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on his first foreign trip since he returned to office for a third term in June. Mr Modi landed on Monday, just hours after Russian bombing killed at least 41 people in Ukraine, including at a children's hospital in Kyiv, sparking a global outcry. Photos from Moscow showed a beaming Mr Modi hugging the Russian president. A video of a smiling Mr Putin calling Mr Modi ""my dearest friend"" and telling him that he was ""delighted to see him"" has gone viral in India.  Mr Modi's two-day visit - his first to the Kremlin since 2019 - coincides with a Nato summit in Washington, where the 2022 invasion will be a major theme. India, a key global economy, has close ties with both Russia and the US and its partners and officials in Delhi are playing down questions over the timing of Mr Modi's trip. They say the annual summit is part of a long-standing strategic partnership and its scheduling has nothing to do with the Nato summit. But a sour note has been struck with the US expressing concern. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller urged Mr Modi to emphasise Ukraine's territorial integrity during his talks in Moscow.  Mr Miller also said the US had raised concerns with India regarding its relationship with Russia. ""We would urge India, as we do any country when it engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN charter, that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty,"" he said at a press briefing on Monday.  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky went further - and did not mince his words. ""It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,"" he posted on X (formerly Twitter) late on Monday. Mr Modi told President Putin that India was ready to offer any assistance in establishing peace in Ukraine. Russian state TV quoted him saying that war was ""not a solution"".  He also said the death of children was painful and terrifying, a day after the deadly attack on the Kyiv children's hospital. ""Whether it is war, conflict or a terrorist attack, any person who believes in humanity, is pained when there is loss of lives,"" Mr Modi said. ""But even in that, when innocent children are killed, the heart bleeds and that pain is very terrifying."" The Nato summit in Washington, which begins on Tuesday, is being held to mark the 75th anniversary of the Western defence grouping which was mainly formed as a bulwark against the then Soviet Union after World War Two. Nato countries have been vehemently opposed to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, while India and Mr Modi have refrained from any explicit criticism of President Putin except calling for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. As Western nations try to isolate Moscow by imposing sanctions, President Putin has been having summit-level meetings with leaders of key nations like China, India, Turkey and others. Some are now asking whether Mr Modi's presence in Moscow could be to Mr Putin's advantage. Is the message India is sending out playing into the hands of Russia? “The bilateral visit this time is just a scheduling priority that we have undertaken. And that’s what it is,” Vinay Kwatra, permanent secretary to the Indian foreign ministry, told the BBC ahead of Mr Modi’s visit, rejecting any connection between the two events. India and Russia share close defence and strategic relations from Cold War days and Moscow remains a key supplier of weapons. India, which maintains one of the largest militaries in the world, has long-standing border disputes with its neighbours Pakistan and China. Experts say Mr Modi giving importance to Moscow is not a surprise and the relationship goes beyond defence procurement. “If you look at the historical trend, it [Moscow] has been one of the constants in Indian foreign policy,” Pankaj Saran, former Indian ambassador to Moscow, told the BBC. “The main pillars of the relationship include defence co-operation, energy and science technology.” Over the years, Russia has provided technical assistance to build several nuclear power plants in India.  Since the Ukraine war began, Delhi has also been buying billions of dollars of discounted oil from Moscow after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia to limit what it could sell or charge for the product. Driven by a surge in the purchase of oil, bilateral trade between India and Russia in the last few years has soared to $65bn (£50.76bn). India’s exports to Russia stand at just $4bn. Indian officials say a key priority for Mr Modi will be to address this trade imbalance and encourage Russian investment in India as well as moving some defence production to India. For the past 20 years, the West, particularly the US, has cultivated closer ties with India in what many see as a bulwark against the threat posed by an increasingly assertive China. India also became a member of the Quad - a strategic forum with the US, Australia and Japan - which is seen as a grouping aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Asia Pacific. But faced with increasing Western hostility, President Putin has developed closer strategic and economic ties with Beijing. The development has not gone unnoticed in India, China's long-time rival. A deadly brawl on the disputed border in Ladakh region in June 2020 killed 20 Indian and at least four Chinese soldiers and escalated tensions. There are apprehensions in India that it may be left out of the Moscow-Beijing equation. “One option currently being exercised by Delhi is to keep the Russia channel open to maintain the friendship and avoid taking any measures which may further aggravate Russia’s drift into Chinese arms that is being caused by US and Western policies,” says Mr Saran. Though Delhi has diversified its weapons inventory in recent decades by buying American, French and Israeli arms systems, it still relies heavily on Moscow and there have been concerns the war in Ukraine has had an impact on its defence exports. “There are reports of delays in the supplies of some spare parts and the delivery of the remaining S-400 anti-missile defence system. So, there will definitely be some discussion on this during the visit,” says Anil Trigunayat, a former ambassador and now a Distinguished Fellow at the Vivekananda International Foundation in Delhi. Delhi and Moscow are not without their own differences. There have been several reported cases of Indian nationals who were lured with false promises of lucrative job offers and ended up fighting for the Russian army in Ukraine. Four Indians have died so far in the fighting. Indian officials insist that during this visit, Mr Modi will press his Russian counterparts for an early discharge of Indians - thought to number in the dozens - still fighting in the war. India is aware that it needs both the United States and Russia to counter its rival China. Hence, it feels the need to strike a balance not to offend either of the two.  “India follows a policy of strategic autonomy and multi-alignments. We have strategic relationships with both the US and Russia. These are mutually exclusive partnerships,” says Mr Trigunayat.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd91pe5r9go,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-09 13:11:35,
209,Kyiv hospital boss describes 'real hell' of missile attack,"The director of Ukraine's largest children's hospital, hit on Monday by a deadly missile strike blamed on Russia, has said the attack was ""real hell"". ""Children and adults screamed in fear, wounded from pain"" in Kyiv's Ohmadyt hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir told the UN Security Council on Tuesday. He said more than 1,200 patients and personnel were in the hospital at the time and three heart surgeries were being carried out. Two adults were killed and more than 300 people injured, including children, he added. On Tuesday, Ukraine published photos of what it said were recovered fragments of a Russian cruise missile that hit the hospital in the capital. Russia claimed the blast was caused by a misfiring Ukrainian air defence missile, but the UN said it was highly likely Moscow was behind the attack - a conclusion shared by analysts who spoke to BBC Verify. The attack was globally condemned, with US President Joe Biden saying it was a ""horrific reminder of Russia's brutality"".  Mr Biden, who is hosting a Nato summit in Washington on Tuesday, also vowed to strengthen Kyiv's air defences. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is attending the summit, said: ""We are fighting for more air defence systems for Ukraine... We are fighting for more planes."" At least 46 people - including 33 in Kyiv - were killed across Ukraine in a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes on Monday, local officials said.  Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko declared 9 July as a day of mourning in the city.

208,The secret hospitals offering criminals new faces,"Clandestine hospitals in the Philippines have been offering plastic surgery services to fugitives and scam centre workers to help them evade arrest, authorities say. Two such illegal hospitals could be shut down ""in the coming weeks"" after police raided the first one in Manila's southern suburbs in May, a police spokesman told the BBC. Hair transplant tools, dental implants and skin whitening IV drips were seized from the hospital in Pasay City two months ago. ""You can create an entirely new person out of those,"" said Winston John Casio, a spokesman for the Presidential Anti-Organised Crime Commission (PAOCC). The two illegal hospitals under surveillance are believed to be four times larger than the one in Pasay, authorities said. Their clients allegedly include those from online casinos, who are working in the Philippines illegally, Mr Casio said. The online casinos or Pogos (Philippine Online Gaming Operations) cater to players in mainland China, where gambling is illegal. But police say Pogos have been used as cover for criminal activities such as telephone scams and human trafficking. Three doctors - two from Vietnam and one from China - a Chinese pharmacist, and a Vietnamese nurse were arrested in the Pasay raid, none of whom were licensed to work in the Philippines. Authorities also found a hemodialysis machine, suggesting that the facility, which was about 400 sqm, offered various medical treatments in addition to plastic surgery. ""They look like regular clinics on the outside, but once you enter, you'll be shocked by the type of technology they have,"" Mr Casio said. “These Pogo hospitals don’t ask for the proper identification cards... You could be a fugitive, or you could be an illegal alien in the Philippines,” he said. Authorities were tipped off on the existence of the illegal hospital in Pasay City. Pogos flourished under former president Rodrigo Duterte, who sought friendly ties with China during his six-year term that ended in 2022. However, his successor Ferdinand Marcos Jr has mounted a crackdown on Pogos, citing their criminal links. ""The president does not want the Philippines to be painted as a 'scam hub' and has given us a directive to go after scam farms because of how they have been targeting large numbers of people from all over the world,"" Mr Casio said. In December 2022, immigration officials arrested a suspected Chinese mafia member who allegedly underwent plastic surgery to evade detection. Such cases may be linked to the underground hospitals, Mr Casio said.  The mayor of a sleepy town north of the capital, Alice Guo, recently came under fire after a Pogo scam centre was busted near her office. She has also been accused of being a spy for China after authorities questioned her birth records.",2024-07-09 23:11:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2g7x318r6o,"Kelly Ng,",2024-07-09 10:11:35,
212,McEnroe defends 'Darth Vader' Djokovic,"This video can not be played McEnroe shares his view on Djokovic frustrations John McEnroe praised Novak Djokovic for criticising the Wimbledon crowd, saying the Serb had been disrespected in his career at least 100 times. The tennis legend said Djokovic's ability to deal with the ""worst heat"" is why he has become the greatest player of all time. Djokovic spoke out against fans after his Wimbledon fourth-round win, claiming they used the bellowing of his opponent Holger Rune's surname as ""an excuse to boo"". The 24-time Grand Slam champion insisted the noise - fans elongating the first vowel in Rune's surname - was designed to wind him up. McEnroe, who won seven singles majors, agreed with the 37-year-old Serb. Asked by presenter Clare Balding on BBC TV about what he would say to Djokovic, the 65-year-old American said it would be: ""Well done."" McEnroe added: ""Don't you think there's been at least 100 matches over the course of the last 10-15 years that Djokovic has been disrespected because of how good he is? ""What has he done that's so bad? Name something. What is it, he wants it? He competes as hard as anyone who's ever competed? Is it the look, where he's from? ""He's like the Darth Vader compared to two of the classiest acts we've seen play tennis - Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. ""Who can compare to them in terms of what they brought to the table? Nobody - and then this guy Djokovic spoils the party. ""So then how about respecting him after all this? ""He's by far the guy who's taken the worst heat and that's why I would say he's the greatest that's ever played."" Djokovic wore a mask of the Darth Vader character, a villain from the Star Wars sci-fi films, for his walk-on to a match in 2012, recalling in 2022 how ""that was myself in the crazy, young days"". This video can not be played Djokovic expresses anger towards Rune supporters For anyone intending to make Djokovic angry, there can be consequences. In fact, he might very well want you to do that. Winding up the seven-time Wimbledon champion, as some Centre Court fans did by accident or design on Monday, seems to further fuel his insatiable desire for success. ""If there were people in the crowd trying to antagonise him and wanted Rune to win - that's the worst thing you can do,"" former Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman told BBC Sport. ""He loves the confrontation. He thrives off that energy. And he plays better. ""He destroyed Rune. ""If you want to try and upset Djokovic's performance you should just sit quietly."" On Wednesday, Djokovic returns to the same evening slot on Centre Court for his quarter-final against Australia's Alex de Minaur. Henman thinks the crowd's reaction towards Djokovic will be ""great"" and believes Monday night's drama will not have any bearing on the atmosphere. ""At 37 years of age, and with what Djokovic has achieved, I love that passion and hunger and desire to win. It's brilliant,"" said the former British number one. Over the years, we have often seen Djokovic feeding off negative energy to produce some of his finest tennis. Being a rebel with a cause is how many believe he likes it. ""I think he wants to hear the boos - that makes him play better,"" said former Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis. ""If I were to play him I would just give him compliments at the change of ends. I wouldn't want to annoy that guy, that's for sure."" Nenad Zimonjic, who has been described by Djokovic as an ""older brother"", presented a slightly different view. Former Wimbledon doubles champion Zimonjic spent time as a Davis Cup team-mate of Djokovic and was also part of his coaching team earlier this year. ""I think he prefers when the crowd is for him,"" the 48-year-old Serb told BBC Sport. ""But he finds a way to use it the other way round as well."" 'An excuse to boo' - Djokovic irked by Wimbledon crowd Djokovic beats Rune - then accuses fans of 'disrespect' Wimbledon changes finals plan and confirms rain 'last resort' This video can not be played Novak Djokovic discusses his post-match comments about the Wimbledon crowd with BBC Sport. Despite being the second most successful man in the Open era at the All England Club, Djokovic's relationship with the British crowd has blown hot and cold. That is largely because of the popularity of the player he is trying to match on eight titles: Federer. In the epic 2019 final when Djokovic beat Federer, the Serb had the majority of the crowd against him in an atmosphere which felt almost tribal. Afterwards, Djokovic's former coach Boris Becker said there should have been more respect shown by the partisan crowd. Two years ago, Djokovic was booed on Centre Court after he blew a kiss to fans following his semi-final win over Briton Cameron Norrie. ""The reality is, in Djokovic's world, the comparison is Federer,"" added Henman. ""Federer is one of the most popular athletes in the whole of sport and I think Djokovic has always craved that same level of attention. ""You can debate whether that will ever happen - it probably won't."" Djokovic has often tried going on the charm offensive. The gesture of triumphantly throwing his heart to all corners of the court was designed to help Djokovic draw out the crowd's love. Post-match interviews featuring witty, charismatic and respectful answers demonstrate the engaging side of his personality. Occasionally, as we saw on Monday, he is still tipped over the edge by what he says is disrespect. ""I think for somebody who has been as successful as he is, he's still very confused as to why he doesn't get the love of the people the way that Federer and Nadal did,"" added former British number one Annabel Croft on BBC Radio 5 Live.

218,Brazil's Bolsonaro may be charged over jewel sale,"Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro benefited from an illegal scheme to sell $1.2m (£937,000) in jewellery and other luxury gifts given to his government, police investigators say. It comes after Brazil's Federal Police last week recommended charging him with crimes including money-laundering over undeclared jewellery gifted between 2019 and 2022. The latest police report states that officials had ""acted to divert"" expensive gifts to Mr Bolsonaro from foreign governments. The officials then sought to sell the items for ""the illicit enrichment of the then president"".  The far-right politician has claimed that cases against him are politically motivated.  The report submitted to the Supreme Federal Court on Monday says that cash raised from such sales was paid to the former president ""without using the formal banking system"". Prosecutors have been given 15 days to decide whether to formally charge Mr Bolsonaro. The case centres on allegations that he tried to illegally import and keep millions of dollars' worth of jewellery given to him and his wife by Saudi Arabia in 2019. The jewels were impounded by Brazilian customs officials when a member of Mr Bolsonaro's entourage tried to bring them into the country in 2021. The police report says the jewellery included Rolex watches and Patek Phillipe watches, as well as diamond pieces from luxury brand Chopard. Mr Bolsonaro's team later returned some of the jewellery once news of the case was reported, it added. The former president's lawyer, Paulo Cunha, posted on social media that heads of state ""have no direct or indirect influence"" on what happens to official gifts. Mr Bolsonaro is also facing other legal challenges, including an investigation into whether he incited rioters who stormed key government buildings after he narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. This led to unsubstantiated claims by his supporters of voting fraud - eventually escalating into the violent scenes in the capital. He has voiced ""regret"" for the unrest, but denies he caused it. However, Brazil's Supreme Court has agreed to include him in its investigation into the storming of government buildings on 8 January 2023.

219,Hamas critic beaten by masked men in Gaza,"A Palestinian activist known for organising anti-Hamas protests in Gaza has been taken to hospital after an attack by a group of masked men. Amin Abed, 35, was admitted in critical condition after being kidnapped near his home by five assailants on Monday afternoon. A well-known activist, Mr Abed told the BBC: “I will not stop using my right to express my rejection of the 7 October attack."" Public dissent against Hamas has grown in recent months as residents of Gaza grow angry at the huge toll inflicted on the enclave since the start of the war.  More than 38,240 people have been killed, including 50 in the past day, in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began its offensive following Hamas's unprecedented 7 October attack. Mr Abed described being kidnapped near his house by a group of five men who were armed with guns and machetes.  He was taken to a semi-demolished house, beaten, and called ""an agent for Israel"" and ""a traitor"".  The leader of the group told Mr Abed's assailants to break his fingers so he could not again write criticism of Hamas or ""the heroic events of 7 October"".  After a group of passers-by attempted to intervene, the attackers fired shots into the air and told them to stay away, claiming they were from Hamas security forces. Eventually, the assailants left and bystanders were able to take Mr Abed to a hospital.  Mr Abed is considered a popular figure. Before the war, had been arrested multiple times for speaking out against Hamas rule. On Monday morning, Mr Abed wrote a long criticism of Hamas on Facebook, accusing the group of “dividing the Palestinian people” and “quashing their dream of a state”. “We are tired, world,” he wrote, “we are really tired.” Last week, in an interview with the BBC, he said: “[Hamas] has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Days earlier, he criticised Hamas in an interview with Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya. A  clip from the interview was picked up on TikTok. In 2019, Mr Abed helped organise protests over the state of Gaza’s economy. Fatah, the ruling party in the West Bank and political rival of Hamas, released a statement on Monday condemning “the blatant assault on activist Amin Abed in Gaza”. It did not name Hamas, but said the ""de facto authorities in Gaza"" had allowed ""criminality"" to spread in the enclave and held them fully responsible for Abed's well-being. Hamas violently ousted Fatah from the Gaza Strip in 2007, a year after winning national elections, reinforcing its power there and deepening a schism between the two dominant Palestinian groups. Gaza’s Hamas-run police force has largely disappeared from the streets since the start of the war because of being targeted in Israeli air strikes, though the group remains the official authority in the territory. The BBC has approached Hamas for comment. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to its attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82xx9pj5do,"Tom Bennett,",2024-07-09 16:11:36,
220,Anchorman and Bob's Burgers actor pleads guilty over Jan 6,"Comedian Jay Johnston, known for his roles in Anchorman and Bob's Burgers, has pleaded guilty over his involvement in the 6 January US Capitol riot. Mr Johnston admitted on Monday to a single count of obstructing officers during a civil disorder. He will be sentenced in October and faces up to five years in federal prison. More than 540 Capitol riot participants have served time behind bars. Mr Johnston, 55, has acting credits in Hollywood going back to the mid-1990s. He acted and wrote for all four seasons of HBO's Mr Show with Bob and David, starred in all three seasons of Comedy Central's The Sarah Silverman Program, and had a recurring role on the Fox sitcom Arrested Development. Among the other films in which the Illinois native has starred are Men in Black II. Internet sleuths identified him as a participant in the 6 January riot from a social media post by the FBI in March 2021. Authorities have said he ""participated with other rioters in a group assault"" on police officers protecting a Capitol entrance and ""helped carry a stolen police riot shield out"". According to court documents, Mr Johnson also admitted to an acquaintance by text message that he had been there. “The news has presented it as an attack. It actually wasn’t,"" he wrote.  ""Thought it kind of turned into that. It was a mess. Got maced and tear gassed and I found it quite untastic.” That December, amid the allegations, Mr Johnston was fired from his role on animated series Bob's Burgers. He voiced fan-favourite character Italian restaurateur Jimmy Pesto. The character was recast in 2023 and returned to the show for its latest season. Mr Johnston was arrested in California last summer and initially charged on four counts. His plea agreement saw him admit to a single civil disorder charge while the other three offences were dropped. His sentencing hearing is set for 7 October. Nearly 1,500 people have been charged over their role in the violence that unfolded in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, according to the justice department. Of those individuals, more than 800 have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from assaulting law enforcement to seditious conspiracy.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yqv84x4ko,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-08 23:11:36,
221,South Korea politician blames women for rising male suicides,"A politician in South Korea is being criticised for making dangerous and unsubstantiated comments after linking a rise in male suicides to the increasingly “dominant” role of women in society. In a report, Seoul City councillor Kim Ki-duck argued women’s increased participation in the workforce over the years had made it harder for men to get jobs and to find women who wanted to marry them. He said the country had recently “begun to change into a female-dominant society” and that this might ""partly be responsible for an increase in male suicide attempts”. South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among the world’s rich countries but also has one of the worst records on gender equality. Councillor Kim’s comments have been criticised as the latest in a series of out-of-touch remarks made by male politicians. Councillor Kim, from the Democratic Party, arrived at his assessment when analysing data on the number of suicide attempts made at bridges along Seoul’s Han river. The report, published on the city council’s official website, showed that the number of suicide attempts along the river had risen from 430 in 2018 to 1,035 in 2023, and of those trying to take their lives the proportion who were men had climbed from 67% to 77%. Suicide prevention experts have expressed concern over Mr Kim’s report. “It is dangerous and unwise to make claims like this without sufficient evidence,” Song Han, a mental health professor at Seoul’s Yonsei University, told the BBC. He pointed out that globally more men took their lives than women. In many countries, including the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50. Even so, Prof Song said the reasons behind the sharp rise in men attempting suicide in Seoul needed to be scientifically studied, adding it was “very regrettable” that the councillor had made it about gender conflict.  In South Korea there is a substantial gulf between the number of men and women in full-time employment, with women disproportionately working temporary or part-time jobs. The gender pay gap is slowly narrowing, but still women are paid on average 29% less than men. In recent years an anti-feminist movement has surged, led by disillusioned young men, who argue they have been disadvantaged by attempts to improve women’s lives. Appearing to echo such views, Councillor Kim’s report concluded that the way to overcome “the female-domination phenomenon” was to improve people’s awareness of gender equality so that “men and women can enjoy equal opportunities”. Koreans took to the social media platform X to denounce the councillor’s remarks as “unsubstantiated” and “misogynistic”, with one user questioning whether they were living in a parallel universe. The Justice Party accused the councillor of “easily shifting the blame to women in Korean society who are struggling to escape gender discrimination"". It has called on him to retract his remarks and instead “properly analyse” the causes of the problem. When approached for comment by the BBC, Councillor Kim said he had “not intended to be critical of the female-dominated society”, and was merely giving his personal view about some of its consequences. However, his comments follow a number of unscientific and sometimes bizarre political proposals aimed at tackling some of South Korea’s most pressing social issues, including mental illness, gender violence and the lowest birth rate in the world. Last month, another Seoul councillor in his 60s published a series of articles on the authority’s website encouraging young women to take up gymnastics and practise pelvic floor exercises in order to raise the birth rate. At the same time, a government think tank recommended that girls start school earlier than boys, so that classmates would be more attracted to each other by the time they were ready to marry. “Such comments encapsulate just how pervasive misogyny is in South Korea,” said Yuri Kim, director of the Korean Women's Trade Union. She accused politicians and policymakers of not even trying to understand the challenges women faced, preferring to scapegoat them instead. “Blaming women for entering the workforce will only prolong the imbalances in our society,” she told the BBC. Currently women account for 20% of South Korea’s members of parliament, and 29% of all local councillors. Seoul City Council told the BBC there was no process in place to vet what politicians published on its official website unless the content was illegal. It said individuals were solely responsible for their content and would face any consequences at the next election.

222,Prosecutors probe Marine Le Pen campaign funding,"An investigation has been opened into the financing of French far right National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen's 2022 presidential campaign. Prosecutors in Paris said they will look into allegations of embezzlement, forgery and fraud, and that a candidate on an electoral campaign accepted a loan. The investigation was opened a week ago following a 2023 report by the National Commission on Campaign Accounts and Political Financing (CNCCFP). The commission's role is to scrutinise candidates' election expenses and funding and to flag any issues that arise.  No more details have been given on the reasons for the inquiry, nor has Ms Le Pen's camp commented. The RN has previously received loans from Russian and Hungarian banks. The Russian loan worth €9.4m (£7.9m), however, was all paid back last year.  In 2017, the RN was charged with giving party members suspected fake jobs as assistants at the European Parliament.  About €5m (£4m) allegedly went to RN assistants who were not working for MEPs, but doing party work in France. The RN denied the charges and said it would prove it did not embezzle cash.  A court will judge Ms Le Pen and 24 other members of her party over the alleged misuse of EU funds in September. A veteran of French politics, Ms Le Pen ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022.  She was re-elected to parliament during the first round of France's snap parliamentary election last month. Her party unexpectedly came third, despite having achieved a decisive victory in the European Parliament elections just weeks before.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnk4qlwn7dpo,"Laura Gozzi,",2024-07-09 12:11:36,
223,Mummified body of missing US climber found after 22 years,"The mummified remains of an American man have been found 22 years after he went missing while climbing a mountain in Peru. William Stampfl, 59, was reported missing in June 2002 after an avalanche buried his climbing party while scaling Mount Huascarán, Peru's highest peak. Peruvian police said ice melt had exposed Stampfl's mummified and clothed body. He was identified by the passport found among his belongings. Police said Stampfl's body was well-preserved by the Peruvian ice, with his clothes in good condition, the AFP reported. He was still wearing his boots and harness. Mount Huascarán, which is situated about 270 miles (435km) north of the capital Lima, stands at more than 22,000ft (6,706m). With its snowy peaks and stunning climbs, the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in north-eastern Peru is a magnet for mountaineers worldwide. Stampfl embarked with two others - Steve Erskine and Matthew Richardson - on a 19-day round trip from California to Peru's tallest summit. But an avalanche upended their climb on 24 June 2002. Only Erskine's body had previously been found.  Stampfl is at least the third person this year found dead in the region. The body of an Italian climber who fell while scaling another peak was recovered last month, while an Israeli man was found dead in May nearly a month after his disappearance. Last month, five bodies were found frozen in ice on the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest. Glaciers are melting and receding around the world, which most scientists attribute to accelerating climate change.

224,$1bn gift pays tuition for most at Johns Hopkins med school,"Many current and future medical students at Johns Hopkins University found out on Monday that their tuition will soon be free.  Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and business leader, has given $1bn (£780m) to cover tuition for students whose parents earn less than $300,000 a year. Those whose parents bring in less than $175,000 will also have their living expenses paid. The move affects around two-thirds of current and prospective medical students at Johns Hopkins, which is based in Maryland. “As the US struggles to recover from a disturbing decline in life expectancy, our country faces a serious shortage of doctors, nurses, and public health professionals,"" Mr Bloomberg, said. ""And yet, the high cost of medical, nursing, and graduate school too often bars students from enrolling.""  The latest medical school graduates from Johns Hopkins had an average student loan debt exceeding $100,000, the school said.  Mr Bloomberg's gift, made through his philanthropic organisation, will also increase financial aid available for students in other programmes, including graduate students in public health and nursing, education, engineering and others.  The university's president, Ron Daniels, said that “removing financial barriers to individual opportunity fuels excellence, innovation and discoveries that redound to the benefit of society"". This is not Mr Bloomberg's first large contribution to the university, which is also his alma mater.  In 2018, Bloomberg Philanthropies made a $1.8bn donation to remove financial barriers for undergraduate students. His latest donation follows Kenneth Langone and his wife, Elaine's $200m donation to the NYU Long Island School of Medicine in 2023, which made tuition free for all medical students.",2024-07-09 23:11:36,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cldyn779309o,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-09 15:11:36,
225,Camila Cabello: I need to treat myself with kindness,"""I have a very naïve attitude before I put music out,"" says Camila Cabello. ""I think because I love it so much and I think it’s good, everybody’s going to love it."" Camila's just released her fourth studio album C,XOXO. As someone who's been in the public eye since she was 15, it's not exactly a first for her. But she tells BBC Newsbeat that the more experimental sound of her latest meant she felt ""a little bit more nervous"" than usual. Camila started out as a member of girl group Fifth Harmony before going solo and finding success with a Latin-influenced pop sound. Her best-known tracks, Havana and Señorita, have had billions of plays on Spotify. So C,XOXO was a potentially risky departure for the 27-year-old, but it's one that's led to collabs with rappers Drake, Lil Nas X and Playboi Carti. ""It’s a testament to 'what’s the worst that can happen?',"" says Camila. ""And I had that energy throughout this album."" Camila's also been braver recently when it comes to speaking about her mental health and living with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. She says it's a ""complicated"" subject she can be ""hesitant to talk about"", especially around taking medication and the stigma that can come with it. Camila says she feels privileged to have had access to ""things that have made my life a lot easier"", such as tools, therapy, and medication. But at times, particularly in her early 20s, Camila says she's felt guilty for not feeling great despite being a globally famous pop singer.  ""One of my favourite things about getting older and experiencing life is this persistent sense of irony,"" she says.  ""Where what you see a lot of time is not the reality."" ""I think it just goes to show you how complex we are and how complicated we are as humans that it's not really black and white."" Camila says she still has bad days but practising ""self-compassion"" has helped her. ""I think it's really treating yourself with kindness and love,"" she says. ""The more empathy, less judgement and the more compassion you have for yourself, and for your own difficult emotions, the more that you'll have that empathy and space for other people."" Camila was born in Havana to a Cuban mum and Mexican dad, and moved between both countries until she was six, when the family settled in Miami, Florida. She says talking openly about how she was feeling didn't always come naturally. ""Latin families - or immigrant families - don’t a lot of the time have the bandwidth for realising what their mental health is,"" she says. ""They’re so focused on survival and it’s just not on their radar. ""That was a big part, probably in the beginning for me, the confusion of my own guilt and shame of 'I should be great'."" Family is an important pillar in Camila’s life. Her previous album, Familia, written during the Covid pandemic, explored her Latin roots and how her family inspired her work ethic. She says that's filtered into making C,XOXO. ""My mum is the definition of so hard-working,"" says Camila.  ""If I’m working, she’s like working,"" she says. She says her mum, like lots of ""immigrant parents"", is constantly ""trying to improve and create"". ""They just have that kind of hustle mentality. And I really had to have that for this album."" Camila says she and her team spent 10 days in the Bahamas recording the album, and ""barely saw the sunlight because we were in the studio the whole time"". ""Anytime you are trying to make something great, it’s insanely hard,"" she says. ""I remember just being so frustrated and was exhausted."" But some things came a bit easier. Getting Drake involved simply ""started with a DM"", and wasn’t actually a request to ""do a song"" at first. ""At that time, I really genuinely was looking for friendship and connections with other artists in the music industry, because I had been such a hermit for so long,"" Camila says. ""I just felt like kind of antisocial. ""This album, I kind of spread my wings a little bit more."" When Camila speaks to Newsbeat it's just after her Glastonbury appearance, and she's just woken up from a nap with her mum. She says she's ""still recovering"" from her Other Stage set ""and pretty sure I’m getting sick"". But once she's feeling better, Camila says she wants to spread those wings even further, and ""just wants to have shows in the UK"". ""They were so loud and everyone was so kind. I felt welcomed,"" she says. ""I love the Brits and the Brits love me.""

230,"'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history","An initial version of this story was published on 15 June 2024 Imagine playing for your country in a major tournament aged 16. Lamine Yamal has done that - and more. The Barcelona star, who is already the youngest man to play at the European Championship, is now the youngest to score after curling in a sublime equaliser against France in Tuesday's semi-final. Spain went on to reach Sunday's final, after Dani Olmo's first-half strike sealed victory, with Yamal turning 17 the day before the Berlin showpiece. The tricky winger - full name Lamine Yamal Nasraoui Ebana - has already played 51 times for Barcelona, scoring seven goals, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to see Yamal mixing it with the very best. Those who know him best certainly aren't. This video can not be played Yamal scores 'unbelievable' equaliser for Spain An outrageously precocious talent, Yamal will turn 17 on 13 July, the day before the final. The previous youngest player at the Euros was Poland's Kacper Kozlowski - 17 years and 246 days - in a 1-1 group-stage draw against Spain in Seville in June 2021, but you get the feeling Yamal could break a few more records in the coming days. “He will do things we cannot yet imagine,” says Ivan Carrasco, who trained him at junior level. “I remember him as a boy who was very aware of his talent. In sport, talented people tend to be very selfish, but not Yamal. “I saw a generous child who did not seek recognition. As a coach you sometimes thought, 'what can I teach him if he does things that I can't even imagine from the bench?' “The closer you are to Lamine, the more you realise that the label of ‘decisive’ falls short. He is a very, very special footballer."" Former Barcelona reporter and current Sport TV journalist Jaume Marcet remembers the day he knew he was watching a prodigy. Marcet, who is an expert of Barcelona grassroots football, said: ""The most brutal display I have seen in grassroots football was from Lamine in the final of the Catalunya cadet tournament. ""I had seen Messi perform brutally, but never something like what Lamine did that match, with kids older than him. That day he did everything.""  This video can not be played 'The next superstar' - pundits praise Yamal Yamal's trademark 304 celebration is formed by angling three fingers on his right hand, forming a '0' with his thumb and forefinger, and angling four fingers on his left hand. It is a homage to the neighbourhood where he was raised, Rocafonda 304, an area of Barcelona rarely seen by the millions of tourists who flock to Catalonia's capital and one of the most deprived zones, not just in Catalonia but in the whole of the Spain. The son of a mother from Equatorial Guinea and a father from Morocco, after being spotted by Barcelona as a seven-year-old playing in the concrete parks in Rocafonda, his father took him by the hand into Barcelona, where he asked: ""Do you want my son to play for Barcelona?"" When they said ""yes"", he replied: ""Well, educate him first."" Yamal moved into Barcelona's La Masia academy, despite the close proximity of where he lived. In an interview with Sport, Xavi Martin, former director of La Masia, remembers the meeting with the player, his parents and the agent at the time, Ivan de la Pena, so that the boy could live in La Masia. ""We met on a Tuesday and on Saturday he was already packing his bags,"" he said.  Yamal's success is not just his, but that of an entire area until now ignored, decried, demeaned. He is a beacon of hope for people who see in his success that dreams can come true, that anything is possible. Yamal fell in love with football watching his father and older cousin play in the park opposite where he lived and where he would be spotted. ""I spent more time at the park than at home. Every time I set foot in the street it was to play football. These experiences stay with you,"" he said. The records just keep tumbling. He is the youngest to have played for Barcelona - at 15 years and 290 days - since 15-year-old Armando Sagi in 1922.  At the age of 16 years and 57 days, he became the youngest player and goalscorer for Spain.  Yamal's talent has also not gone unnoticed by the very person whom many people are daring to compare him too - Lionel Messi. In a WhatsApp message to one of his entourage, the Argentine maestro commented: ""How easy does Lamine make it look?"" Messi has already mentioned Yamal when he was asked about the players who will fight for the Ballon d'Or in the coming years. The player himself is realistic. ""There will never be another like Messi,"" Yamal has replied to the countless comparisons between him and the Barcelona legend. He may be right, but these days there is a huge banner that can be seen at Barcelona home games with a picture of Yamal doing the 304 sign and a logo that states ""El futuro no espera"" (The future won't wait). The rest of this summer will dictate if the future has already arrived.

229,Philipsen powers to Tour de France stage 10 win,"Jasper Philipsen has now won seven stages overall at the Tour de France Belgium's Jasper Philipsen powered to victory in a sprint finish on stage 10 of the Tour de France as Tadej Pogacar retained the leader's yellow jersey. Philipsen, who was led out superbly by his Alpecin-Deceuninck team-mate, world champion Mathieu van der Poel, comfortably held off Eritrea's Biniam Girmay and Germany's Pascal Ackermann, who finished second and third.  Slovenia's Pogacar finished safely in the main bunch, as the threat of crosswinds and echelons failed to materialise on an uneventful 187.3km run from Orleans to Saint-Amand-Montrond. The UAE-Team Emirates rider leads Remco Evenepoel of Soudal-Quick Step by 33 seconds, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Visma-Lease a Bike in third, one minute 15 seconds further back in the general classification. Philipsen was the dominant sprinter 12 months ago, claiming victories in four of the first 11 stages at La Grande Boucle. But until now it had been a largely frustrating Tour for the 26-year-old this year.  A crash on stage three left many riders - including Philipsen - out of position and he was pipped to the line as Mark Cavendish claimed his record 35th stage win two days later in Saint-Vulbas.  A demotion from second to 107th came on stage six after he deviated from his sprinting line - almost colliding with Wout van Aert - and he was unable to match Girmay on stage eight in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. However, with Van der Poel expertly providing assistance, Philipsen finally secured a stage win as he narrowed the gap to Girmay from 96 points to 74 in the race for the green jersey. ""We had some bad luck. I am really happy - it is a big relief. We can finally show our strength, with our lead-out train and did finally what we came for,"" he said. ""Mathieu is a really strong guy. When he can show his power and play his part, there aren't many riders who can emulate him. Having the world champion as your lead-out guy is fantastic.""

Southgate said his team - who won one and drew two of their group stage games before narrowly beating Slovakia and then edging past Switzerland on penalties in the knock-outs - ""couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place"". ""One of our strengths over the years has been having less fear, showing less inhibition,"" he said.  ""But at the beginning of the tournament the expectation weighed heavily and the noise from outside had never been louder."" Captain Harry Kane said the team ""use past experiences to help"" when they approach ""tough"" games like Wednesday's semi-final (20:00 BST). ""I just think during the game you lean on experience, the leaders who have been there and done that,"" Kane said. ""Ultimately it's about going out there and taking the opportunity with both hands. ""Reaching back-to-back European Championship finals would be an amazing achievement and we have the opportunity to go and do that.""

While Kane conceded that ""as we've been getting better the expectation gets higher"", he said the added pressure can sometimes give players a boost.  He added: ""Some will use it in different ways, some will use it as motivation, some will just block it out and focus on what they need to do. Everyone's different. ""From a team point of view we know what we need to achieve. We have a really important game, a really tough game we need to be ready for. We've prepared for that.""

""You are always looking at the freshness of the team and the balance of the team and whether changes are going to make an improvement to the team or not,"" he said. ""The game will take us in a certain direction that will make that decision for us."" Defender Luke Shaw made his first appearance from the bench in the win against Switzerland after returning from injury, but Southgate did not shed any more light on whether he will start Wednesday's game. The manager said they ""have to decide"" if Shaw, who had been injured for four months, is ""ready to start"". Southgate also dismissed concerns over a German referee once criticised over his match-fixing past by Jude Bellingham officiating the game. Bellingham, then playing for Borussia Dortmund,  was fined 40,000 euros (£34,000) in 2021 for referencing Felix Zwayer's previous six-month ban for match fixing. Southgate added: ""I have no concerns about who the referee is, he will be at a very high standard because that is how Uefa make those decisions. It's not even a consideration.""",2024-07-09 23:11:37,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cv2gvqykn5go,Adam Millington,2024-07-09 23:11:37,

But England responded aggressively, with fellow opener Maia Bouchier hitting a rapid 23, while Capsey's spritely innings included two fours and two sixes.  The biggest shot of the day though went to Nat Sciver-Brunt, whose huge booming six off Lea Tahuhu went out of the ground. New Zealand made a poor start to their reply, losing Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr in the powerplay to slip to 12-2. They never really recovered, with Dean removing Suzie Bates and Brooke Halliday in the same over to slip to 31-4.

228,Alcaraz sets up Medvedev semi-final at Wimbledon,"This video can not be played Highlights: Alcaraz beats Paul in four sets Defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz recovered from a slow start to beat Tommy Paul and set up another semi-final against Daniil Medvedev - a repeat of their meeting from last year. Medvedev, who defeated world number one Jannik Sinner, will be looking to avenge his defeat in the 2023 last-four match that Alcaraz won in straight sets on his way to taking the title. Alcaraz was a set and a break of serve down on Court One on Tuesday against American Paul, the 12th seed, but recovered to win 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2 in a match that lasted three hours 11 minutes. Meanwhile, Medvedev had to fight every bit as hard as he defeated Sinner 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 6-3 win in four hours on Centre Court. Alcaraz has already won three Grand Slam titles at the age of 21, while Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, will be aiming to reach the Wimbledon final for the first time. ""Daniil's a really great player. It's the same semi-final as last year so hopefully I'm going to get the same result,"" said Alcaraz. ""He just won against Sinner, the best player right now, so he's in really good shape and I have to play my best. ""I have to believe in myself and try to keep going. It's going to be difficult but I'm going to enjoy it."" Spaniard Alcaraz is a keen football fan and had spoken of his desire to be able to watch Spain in their Euro 2024 semi-final against France later on Tuesday. The 21-year-old looked like he was in a rush to finish his match as he instantly piled on the pressure and took his sixth break-point opportunity to move 2-1 ahead. However, Paul, the champion at Queen’s Club last month, instantly got back on serve as a pulsating encounter full of breathtaking shots, power and commitment played out in front of an enthralled Court One crowd. The sixth game lasted more than 15 minutes, with Paul, in his first Wimbledon quarter-final, missing three chances of a break. But that did not prove costly. He was two points from the opening set in the 10th game, but got over the line two games later, finishing off a delightful passing shot which Alcaraz at full stretch could not reach. Paul took a 2-0 lead in the second set, but from then on Alcaraz recovered and stamped his authority thanks to his court coverage, ability to find spectacular winners and his impressive first serves. The opening three games of the third set saw neither player able to hold serve, but with Paul tiring and starting to produce unforced errors, Alcaraz pulled clear and sealed a superb victory. ""When I lost the first set it was difficult,” said Alcaraz. “But I knew it's a really long journey so I had to stay there. “If I'm struggling and the opponent is playing great tennis, I believe I'll be able to come back and find solutions - I believe in myself the whole time.""

On Tuesday, the 22-year-old took an early lead when Medvedev cracked first in a tie-break - double-faulting on Sinner's second set point. However, Sinner started to appear unwell and struggled to maintain his intensity levels as Medvedev patiently rode out the second set after breaking early. Still out of sorts and after dropping serve early once again, Sinner called for a medical timeout in the third set, receiving attention before going off the court for almost 10 minutes. He returned with renewed energy and the support of the crowd, slowly working his way back. Sinner could not capitalise on two set points, though, as Medvedev held firm and came out on top in a tie-break to nudge ahead in the match. Former teenage prodigy Sinner raced through the fourth set to take the match into a decider - to the delight of the Centre Court crowd. But it was Medvedev who finished the stronger, breaking for a 3-1 lead before sealing victory with a backhand winner on his first match point.

231,Biden's bruising day sinks hopes Democrats will move on,"The most devastating argument against Joe Biden’s re-election bid may have come not from a politician or a pundit, but from a film star. But George Clooney, with his stinging New York Times opinion piece, isn’t the only one speaking out. A growing chorus from Democrats is sinking the president’s hopes of steadying his campaign this week – and perhaps ever. Just when it appeared he had turned a corner, with the influential Congressional Black Caucus and key liberal members of Congress voicing their support for him, the ground has shifted once again – and all in the midst of a high-profile Nato summit with US allies here in Washington. Now the stakes for Mr Biden’s press conference at the end of the Nato summit tomorrow afternoon are even higher. It will be the biggest unscripted test for him since his botched debate two weeks prior which triggered this crisis. Mr Biden also has a sit-down interview scheduled with NBC News presenter Lester Holt on Monday. A fumble or misstep in the days ahead could buttress all the most damaging assertions Mr Clooney, a top Democratic fundraiser, makes in his New York Times piece.  The actor writes that the president's decline is not an illusion; it’s real. He points to a Los Angeles fundraiser he threw for the president last month. “The Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe... of 2010,” he writes. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” The president is not up to the task of beating Donald Trump in November, Clooney continues. He calls the Biden campaign’s claim that he is the choice of Democratic primary voters “disingenuous, at best”. And, perhaps most devastating, he says every prominent Democrat he has spoken with knows all this – whether they’re willing to publicly admit it or not. “We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November"", he writes, “or we can speak the truth.” The Biden campaign is pushing back against the Clooney piece, noting that the president had flown across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in Italy, to attend the star’s fundraiser.  Campaign officials also note that the president has had serious disagreements recently with the star and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, about his administration’s Gaza policy. The opinion piece, published three weeks after that Los Angeles fundraiser, could be viewed like a strike timed for maximum effect. But Clooney isn’t just any movie star. He’s a powerful fundraiser for Democrats and has been for years. Given that California, and the Hollywood industry in particular, is a key part of the party’s money base, Clooney’s comments present a very real threat to Mr Biden.  It also comes on the heels of expressions of dissatisfaction from other big-money Democratic donors, such as Netflix chair Reed Hastings and IAC chair Barry Diller. The actor is also plugged in to party politics, with close ties to former President Barack Obama. It is difficult to imagine that he would have taken to the pages of the New York Times in such a dramatic way, with a double-barrel blast against the sitting president, without at least some tacit sign-off from prominent Democrats. And, increasingly, prominent Democrats are saying things that should give Mr Biden pause.  On Wednesday morning, hours before Clooney's opinion piece was published, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi - who still holds considerable influence within the party - stopped notably short of endorsing his bid for re-election. She said the president’s critics should hold their tongues until after this week’s Nato summit. “Whatever you're thinking,” she said, “you didn't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.” She added that Mr Biden should make a decision quickly about whether to continue his campaign. When prodded that the president had already clearly said he would stay in the race, she dodged. “I want him to do whatever he decides to do,” Mrs Pelosi said. And later in the day, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine – Hillary Clinton’s vice-presidential running mate in 2016 – offered similar lines, about how the president “will do the patriotic thing for the country” and “make that decision”. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, put it even more bluntly: “I’m fully behind him as our nominee until he’s not our nominee.” It’s as if Mr Biden’s tepid supporters simply won’t take “yes, I’m still running” as an answer. Meanwhile, even some of Mr Biden’s staunchest supporters have started to engage in “what if” scenarios. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he still backs the president, and would not run against Vice-President Kamala Harris as the nominee if Mr Biden stepped aside. Senate Democrats are meeting Biden campaign officials on Thursday to discuss the future of the campaign. And Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said he would speak to the president directly about Democratic concerns by Friday. Wheels are turning, but it's unclear whether they are grinding toward a resolution or spinning in place. If Mr Biden were to bow out, it’s still unclear what happens next. Some have suggested that Ms Harris, as the president’s running mate, is next in line. The solution, according to Clooney, is for Democrats to regroup and pick a new nominee, although he is vague about how the process could unfold. And his suggestion that, because of the shortened campaign season, whoever the party chooses would be able to avoid opposition research and negative campaigning – either from fellow Democrats or Republicans – seems naive in the extreme. While the mood in Washington has taken a new turn against the president in the past 24 hours, the mathematics of his situation has not changed. Mr Biden still controls the lion’s share of national convention delegates who ultimately decide the party’s presidential ticket. And while those delegates aren’t explicitly bound to support him, he could replace any who show insufficient loyalty. The opinion polls, while indicating he is trailing Trump, have not changed dramatically since his ill-fated debate. And few show any of the most obvious alternatives to him – the vice-president and prominent Democratic governors – doing substantially better. Even Mr Biden’s critics, with their appeals to his patriotism, sense of duty and concern for American democracy given the potential for a second Trump presidency, implicitly acknowledge that the decision ultimately lies with him. What Wednesday demonstrated, though, is that if he presses ahead, he may never be able to fully put the concerns about his age behind him. His debate performance may end up being a self-inflicted wound that never heals.",2024-07-10 23:09:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g07ng2mn1o,"Anthony Zurcher,",2024-07-10 22:32:51,

241,Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it’s possible,"It's long been known that our lifestyles can help to keep us healthier for longer. Now scientists are asking whether new technology can also help slow down the ageing process of our brains by keeping track of what happens to them as we get older. One sunny morning, 76-year-old Dutch-born Marijke and her husband Tom welcomed me in for breakfast at their home in Loma Linda, an hour east of Los Angeles.  Oatmeal, chai seeds, berries, but no processed sugary cereal or coffee were served - a breakfast as pure as Loma Linda’s mission. Loma Linda has been identified as one of the world’s so-called Blue Zones, places where people have lengthier-than-average lifespans. In this case, it is the city’s Seventh-Day Adventist Church community who are living longer. They generally don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, stick to a vegetarian or even vegan diet and consider it a duty of their religion to look after their bodies as best they can.  This is their “health message”, as they call it, and it has put them on the map - the city has been the subject of decades of research into why its residents live better for longer. Dr Gary Fraser from the University of Loma Linda told me members of the Seventh-Day Adventist community there can expect not only a longer lifespan, but an increased “healthspan” - that is, time spent in good health - of four to five years extra for women and seven years extra for men. Marijke and Tom had moved to the city later in life, but both were now firmly embedded in the community.  There’s no great secret to Loma Linda. Its citizens are simply living a really healthy life, keeping mentally stimulated and valuing the community a religion can often provide. There are regular lectures on healthy living, musical get-togethers and exercise classes. I chatted to Judy, who lives with 112 others at an assisted living facility where there was always the “ability to have heart-opening, brain-opening conversations”, she told me. “What I didn't realise was how important socialisation is to your brain... without it, it seems to shrink and go away,” Judy said.  Science has long recognised the benefits of social interactions and avoiding loneliness.  But now it's also possible to identify whose brains are ageing faster than they should, so they can be tracked and in future potentially be treated better preventatively.  As we move towards more personalised, predictive, preventative healthcare models, early diagnosis will be crucial in all areas of health - powered by the incredible possibilities of AI and big data. Click: Mind over matter Lara Lewington travels to California to meet the scientists and experts researching our brain health and investigating whether we can change how our brains age. Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK only) Computer models that assess how our brains age and predict their decline were shown to me by Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology and computational biology at the University of Southern California. He had created them using MRI scans, data from 15,000 brains and the power of artificial intelligence to understand the trajectory of both brains that are ageing healthily and those in which there is a disease process, such as dementia.  “It's a very sophisticated way to look at patterns that we don't necessarily know about as humans, but the AI algorithm is able to pick up on them,” he said. Prof Irimia did, of course, take a look inside my head.  I'd had a functional MRI scan ahead of my visit and, after analysing its results, Prof Irimia told me I had a brain age eight months older than my chronological age (although apparently the bit that controls talking wasn’t ageing so much. I could have told him that). However, Prof Irimia suggested that the results fall within a two-year error margin. Private companies are starting to commercialise this technology, too. One firm, Brainkey, is offering the service in a variety of clinics around the world. Its founder Owen Philips told me that in future, getting an MRI should become easier. ""It’s becoming much more accessible for people to get an MRI scan, and the images coming off them are getting even better and better,” he said.  “I don't mean to nerd out there. But the technology is just getting to a point where we are able to see things much earlier than we could in the past. And that means we can understand exactly what's happening in an individual patient's brain. With AI, we can support that.” In contrast to what Prof Irimia’s analysis of my MRI scan had told me, Brainkey’s estimate knocked a year off my brain’s biological age. I was also presented with a 3D-printed model of it, which appeared substantial and, I was assured, was life-sized.   The aim here is not just a more precise approach to treatment, but also to be able to quantify how well any interventions are working. Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the past 200 years have given rise to a host of age-related diseases. I did wonder whether, if we all lived long enough, dementia might come knocking at all our doors. Prof Irimia said this was a theory many have investigated albeit not proven, adding that the aim was to find a way to keep on pushing dementia back, hopefully beyond our life expectancies. And all of this takes us back to the same point. Every scientist and doctor, as well as those Blue Zoners, say lifestyle is key. Good diet, keeping active, mentally stimulated and happy are crucial to how our brains age. There’s another important factor too, according to Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book Why We Sleep. “Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do every day to reset your brain and body health,” he evangelised. “There is no operation of your mind that is not wonderfully enhanced when you get sleep, or demonstrably impaired when you don’t get enough.” He spoke of our brains’ cleansing system, which functions during our slumber by washing away the beta-amyloid and tau proteins - these are “two of the main culprits underlying Alzheimer’s”. Changes in sleep patterns are also associated with dementia. Prof Walker described how we don’t just see this in our 60s or 70s - it can begin during our 30s. So, identifying those changes through sleep tracking could potentially become a “model of midlife prevention”. Fauna Bio, a biotech company on the outskirts of San Francisco, is collecting data on ground squirrels during and after hibernation. In this state of torpor, as it is known, the squirrels’ body temperature drops and their metabolic rate is reduced to just 1% of normal.  During this time, they appear to be able to regrow neurons and remake the connections their brains had lost. The company’s aim is to try and create drugs to replicate this process in humans, without them needing to spend half the year underground. Even if some may long for that. Untreated depression has also been shown to raise our risk of dementia. Professor Leanne Williams of Stanford University has identified a method of “visualising” some forms of depression on the brain using an MRI scan, and thus seeing if treatment has worked.  This may be able to help scientists understand more about the root causes of mental health conditions such as depression, as well as providing a way to quantify how treatment is going for a patient. Few have put more faith in science to achieve longevity than Bryan Johnson - the tech entrepreneur spending millions in an effort to reverse his biological age.  Dozens of supplements, 19 hours a day of fasting, workouts that make him look as though he’s going to burst and an array of (sometimes controversial) treatments are what he hopes will turn back the clock. But as 103-year-old Mildred, who I visited in Loma Linda said forcefully, “You absolutely need to be very careful with your diet, it’s true, but I’m not down for, ‘You've got to do this, and this, and this, and absolutely not touch this! '”. She thinks it’s more important we live a little, and let’s face it, she should know.

245,Cypress Hill make 28-year-old Simpsons joke come true,"It was back in 1996 when an episode of The Simpsons featured a joke where Cypress Hill believed they had mistakenly booked the London Symphony Orchestra, whilst under the influence. On Wednesday night, that joke becomes a reality at the Royal Albert Hall.  After years of fan pressure, the American hip-hop group reached out to the LSO over social media and a deal was struck. The one-night only performance in London is based around their acclaimed Black Sunday album. It sold more than three million copies in the US and spent a whole year on the UK charts. The LSO will perform unique orchestral arrangements of the band’s most iconic songs including Insane in the Brain and I Wanna Get High. Cypress Hill have sold more than 20 million albums worldwide and are one of hip-hop’s biggest acts. I went to meet the band at their rehearsals in central London. ""It's been something that we've talked about for many years since the Simpsons episode first aired,"" B-Real (real name Louis Mario Freese) told the BBC.  ""So it's very special for us. And it's coming off the heels of our 30th anniversary for our Black Sunday album."" They called the ability to play on London's most famous stage ""one of those checklist moments"". ""We've played a lot of historical venues throughout our career and stuff like that, but nothing as prestigious as this."" In the Simpsons episode, Homerpalooza, Homer is shocked while on a school run that his music tastes are not considered cool. He then tries to impress the kids by going to the Hullabalooza music festival - a play on the Lollapalooza music festival held in Chicago - and hanging out with rap and rock stars including Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins. The British connection goes beyond the LSO. In the episode, it was actually Peter Frampton, best known for his 1976 album Frampton Comes Alive, who was the guy trying to book the orchestra. Cypress Hill laughed when I asked if he was on the guestlist. ""Yes, actually, we've been trying to invite him,"" B-Real said.  ""We've never met him before, but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton."" They're still waiting for a reply. LSO first violin and board vice-chair Maxine Kwok said ""people are beyond excited at the idea of these diverse musicians mixing on the stage"". ""Being a child of the nineties I remember the episode well,"" she told the BBC, sharing that it was a cultural reference and ""running joke"" for years each time the episode was repeated. At rehearsals there have been cultural differences, leading to misunderstandings.  When the word ""glock"" was used, the LSO took it to mean the percussion instrument the glockenspiel. To Cypress Hill, glock will always be a gun.  This isn't the first time an event in The Simpsons has accurately predicted what has happened in reality many years in the future. However, some social media posts about The Simpsons predicting the future have been fake. Whether the show writers can predict the future or not.... For Cypress Hill, at least, they feel tonight’s show has been their destiny. Later in their career, the act said they became more experimental ""combining hip-hop with rock or metal or punk or reggae or electronic"" and that their new orchestral collaboration is part of who they are as ""out-of-the-box artists"". ""We salute The Simpsons because if they had not written that episode, we probably wouldn't be doing this.""",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3j8y6vnw4o,"Colin Paterson,",2024-07-10 01:09:52,
246,"Baldwin 'played make-believe' with gun, Rust trial hears","Alec Baldwin's trial opened in New Mexico on Wednesday with the prosecution and defence painting starkly different pictures of the events leading up to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.  Mr Baldwin, known for roles on the sitcom 30 Rock and portraying Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, is facing up to 18 months in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Ms Hutchins, 42, died after a gun Mr Baldwin was rehearsing with went off. It was found that the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, accidentally mixed up dummy bullets with live ammunition she had brought from home.  Mr Baldwin has pleaded not guilty and maintains he never pulled the trigger when the gun went off.  In their opening statements, the defence portrayed Mr Baldwin as an actor simply doing his job, who placed his trust in a crew charged with ensuring weapon safety. Prosecutors argued he was a man with a flagrant disregard for gun safety on a film set with a small budget and an inexperienced cast.  Prosecutor Erlinda Johnson opened the trial by telling the jury that the case was ""simple"" and ""straightforward"".  Mr Baldwin ""played make-believe with a real gun"" and ""violated the cardinal rules of firearms safety"", Ms Johnson argued.  “While it was a movie set, it was a real, live workplace for many people,"" she said in her opening statements. ""You will hear that this workplace was on a tight budget... and some of the people who were hired were inexperienced."" Mr Baldwin's defence team, however, argued firearms are treated differently on a film set, where each member of a cast has a designated role and obligation, including when it comes to safety and firearms.  ""He was just acting as he's done for generations, and it was the safety apparatus that failed them all,"" Baldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro said. ""Alec Baldwin committed no crime,"" he said firmly, later adding: ""It was an actor handling a prop.""  Those crew members responsible for safety - including Gutierrez-Reed and David Halls, an assistant director and safety co-ordinator - failed their jobs, he argued.  ""Real bullets are never supposed to be on movie sets,"" Mr Spiro said. Both Halls and Gutierrez-Reed faced charges in the fatal shooting.  Halls has pleaded guilty to unsafe handling of a firearm and Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year, and sentenced to 18 months in prison.  A key issue during the trial is Mr Baldwin's claim that he did not pull the trigger when the revolver he was holding went off. Prosecutors took aim at the claim early, detailing the extensive FBI tests done on the weapon.  It ""worked perfectly fine as it was designed,"" Ms Johnson told the jury.  Mr Baldwin's team also brought up the tests and noted that during one of them, the FBI destroyed parts of the weapon - thus preventing it from being used for further analysis as part of their defence.  The rest of the trial will feature several witnesses and video and audio from the Rust  set, including from the day Ms Hutchins was killed.  The first witness called on Wednesday was Officer Nicholas LeFleur, who responded to the scene and tried to aid Hutchins after she was shot.  Footage from his body camera was shown in court. The room, which can hold about 100 people, was filled with heavy sighs as they watched some of Ms Hutchins' last moments.  Mr Baldwin was visibly uncomfortable, leaning back and forth and at some times grimacing and covering his face.  The trial is set to continue until 19 July. Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crg4wlkl9e9o,"Christal Hayes, Samantha Granville and Emma Vardy,",2024-07-10 22:16:52,
244,Israel military tells Gaza City residents to leave,"The Israeli military has told all residents of Gaza City to evacuate south to the central Gaza Strip, amid intensified operations in the north.  Leaflets dropped by aircraft instruct ""everyone in Gaza City"" to leave what is described as a ""dangerous combat zone"" via designated safe routes - marked as two roads that lead to shelters in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida. The UN has said it is deeply concerned about the evacuation orders being given. It is the second time since the war began that Gaza City as a whole has been asked to evacuate. Over the past two weeks, Israeli forces have re-entered several districts where the military believes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters have regrouped since the start of the year. Hamas has said Israel’s renewed activity in the city is threatening to derail negotiations over a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal, which resumed on Wednesday in Qatar. The talks are being attended by the intelligence chiefs of Egypt, the US and Israel, as well as the prime minister of Qatar. Top Hamas official Hossam Badran told AFP that Israel ""is trying to pressure negotiations by intensifying bombing operations, displacement, and committing massacres"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised Israel’s commitment to a deal as long as Israel’s “red lines are preserved”. There are estimated to be more than a quarter-of-a-million people still living in Gaza City - and some were observed evacuating to the south. Others, though, were not willing to leave. ""I will not leave Gaza [City]. I will not make the stupid mistake that others have made. Israeli missiles do not differentiate between north and south,” resident Ibrahim al-Barbari, 47, told the BBC.  “If death is my fate and the fate of my children, we will die with honour and dignity in our homes,” he said. The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received calls from some residents who were unable to leave their homes because of the intensity of the bombing. ""The information coming from Gaza City shows residents are living through tragic conditions. [Israeli] occupation forces continue to hit residential districts, and displace people from their homes and refuge shelters,"" it said.  In a statement issued earlier on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had  ""conducted a counterterrorism operation"" overnight against Hamas and PIJ fighters who were operating inside a headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza City.  The troops had opened a “defined corridor to facilitate the evacuation of civilians” from the area before they entered the structure and “eliminated terrorists in close-quarters combat”, it added. There was no immediate comment from Unrwa. The IDF also said it had killed dozens of fighters in Gaza City's eastern Shejaiya district and dismantled an underground tunnel route over the past day.    Speaking in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that 60% of Hamas fighters had been killed or wounded since Israel’s offensive began. The BBC could not independently verify these figures. On Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Office said it was ""appalled"" by IDF orders for residents to evacuate to ""areas where Israeli military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured"". It also warned that the Deir al-Balah area was already seriously overcrowded with Palestinians displaced from other areas of Gaza and that there was little infrastructure and limited access to humanitarian assistance.  The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 38,295 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it had reportedly identified 14,680 children, women and elderly people among the dead by the end of April.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08nl4plvzo,"Tom Bennett and Rushdi Abualouf,",2024-07-10 17:09:52,
243,Top Democratic fundraiser Clooney calls on Biden to drop out,"George Clooney has issued a damning call for Joe Biden to quit the US presidential race, hours after senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi swerved questions about whether he should continue. The Hollywood actor and prominent Democratic fundraiser said that the president had won many battles in his career, ""but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time"". His comments came after Mrs Pelosi, the former House Speaker, joined growing disquiet in the party, saying that time was ""running short"" for Mr Biden, 81, to decide whether to stay in the race after his stumbling debate against Donald Trump. The president has stated, repeatedly, that he is determined to remain as the Democratic party's candidate and beat Trump, 78, in November.  Clooney wrote in the New York Times that it was ""devastating to say it"", but the Joe Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago was not the Biden of 2010. ""He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020,"" added the actor. ""He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,"" Clooney said.  The fundraising event, co-hosted by Clooney in Los Angeles and also featuring Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (£23m) for the Biden campaign.  The Biden camp has hit back at the Hollywood star, with an unnamed source telling US media: “The President stayed for over 3 hours [at the fundraiser], while Clooney took a photo quickly and left.” The president's campaign also pointed out that when he attended the fundraiser he had just arrived in Los Angeles from Italy, where he had been at the G7 summit. In his op-ed, Clooney said: ""Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw."" ""This is about age. Nothing more,"" he continued. ""We are not going to win in November with this president."" Clooney added that his concerns matched those of ""every"" member of Congress with whom he had spoken. Asked to respond, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was ""firmly committed"" to his candidacy and beating Trump. Yet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington. Mrs Pelosi, a highly influential voice among Capitol Hill Democrats, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to forge on. When asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: ""I want him to do whatever he decides to do.  ""It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short."" Acknowledging the demands on the president during the Nato summit, Mrs Pelosi told MSNBC: ""I said to everyone - let's just hold off.  ""Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president."" Around a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump. On Tuesday, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent.  Although he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a ""landslide"".  Pat Ryan, a congressman from New York, later wrote on X: “For the good of our country, for my two young kids, I’m asking Joe Biden to step aside."" And Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told reporters he was ""deeply concerned"" about Mr Biden's ability to win the election. The Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was ""running this race to the end"".  Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to speak to Mr Biden by Friday to discuss the concerns brought by several congressional party members. Overall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however.  Gavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still “all in” with Mr Biden.  The Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and progressive  House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed Mr Biden.  On Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: ""I'm with Joe."" Axios, however, reports that Mr Schumer has been privately telling donors he is open to dumping Mr Biden. Questions about the Biden campaign were also swirling at the Nato summit in Washington DC. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he was confident the US would remain a committed member of the alliance - no matter who sits in the White House next year, Mr Biden or Nato-sceptic Mr Trump. At a news conference, the BBC asked Mr Stoltenberg if all 32 members of the alliance shared his optimism, despite the concerns over Mr Biden's candidacy. ""I'm not saying we can always disregard concerns,” said Mr Stoltenberg. ""But the more dangerous the world is, the more obvious it is we need Nato."" He added: ""It is in the interest of all of us to stand together. That also applies for the United States."" Mr Biden will deliver a rare solo news conference on Thursday, and on Monday will record an interview with NBC News, to be broadcast later in the evening. In the swing state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Democratic voters who spoke to the BBC had mixed feelings about Mr Biden. Karren Gillchrist, in Harrisburg, said she remained firmly behind Mr Biden because “he knows exactly what he’s talking about”. But in Elizabethtown, Melissa Nash, working on her laptop in a cafe, said: “I’m torn because I’m not a fan of Trump, but at the same time you need somebody strong to lead the country.” Additional reporting from Rebecca Hartmann in Pennsylvania",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy68gxw32zno,"Brandon Drenon and Bernd Debusmann, at the Nato summit,",2024-07-10 22:58:52,
242,Triple killing suspect captured near cemetery,"A suspect wanted over a crossbow attack which left three women dead has been captured. A major police manhunt for Kyle Clifford, 26, ended when he was found injured near a cemetery in North London. The victims, who were the wife and two daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt, were attacked at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire. A woman who knows the family described them as ""kind, friendly and gentle"" people who ""always made time for others"". Police said the suspect, who left the army two years ago after a short stint, was receiving medical treatment for his injuries, but that ""no shots were fired"" by officers.  Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were found seriously injured at a house in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, just before 19:00 BST on Tuesday, and all died at the scene. Luisa, 36, said she had been a client of Louise's dog grooming business, Groom and Glow, for three years. She added: ""I hope they are remembered as wonderful, hardworking, kind women, rather than victims."" BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Mark Chapman sent his ""love and thoughts"" to fellow commentator and friend Mr Hunt after a ""heartbreaking day"". Speaking through tears at the start of the Euro 2024 pre-match show on 5 Live, Mr Chapman said: ""This has been a heartbreaking day. ""John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries."" A friend of Louise Hunt said he was ""in denial"" about her murder and felt ""angry, sad and in shock"". He told BBC News: ""I couldn't believe what had happened at first. ""I'd heard the news from my sister early in the morning before I'd figured out who the victims were and, once I found out, it's been a massive shock. [I've] been in denial. ""I can't even begin to imagine what the father's going through."" Referring to England's victory at Euro 2024, former footballer Michael Owen posted on X: ""And while the country celebrate, spare a thought for John Hunt. I can't remember feeling so utterly horrified in years. Those poor girls. Truly horrific."" Det Insp Justine Jenkins, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims’ family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened. “This investigation is moving at pace and formal identification of the victims is yet to take place."" Prior to the capture armed police had arrived in numbers at a cemetery close to where a house was searched in Enfield. Officers closed off the the Lavender Hill Cemetery and an air ambulance was seen nearby. Earlier, local councillor Louise Nicolas wrote, in a post on Facebook, that she was ""deeply saddened to learn this morning of the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident"". ""Should anyone wish to speak with us or require any support please do not hesitate to get in touch,"" said Ms Nicolas, a Liberal Democrat who represents the North Bushey ward on Hertsmere Borough Council. ""It goes without saying that this is a live investigation, so speculation as to the circumstances should not be entered into [on public forums].""",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y8ljjexro,"Adam Aiken,",2024-07-10 22:09:52,
240,Musk defeats ex-Twitter staff seeking $500m in severance,"A US judge has dismissed a case brought by former Twitter staff, who had accused billionaire Elon Musk of unlawfully denying roughly $500m in severance payments owed to workers fired after his takeover of the company. Judge Trina Thompson said the employees had not proven that their claims were protected by federal law.  The ruling is a win for Mr Musk, who purchased Twitter in 2022 and immediately set about making changes, including sacking thousands of staff. The moves sparked multiple lawsuits from former staff and vendors, accusing the company of withholding payments that had been promised. This complaint was filed in 2023 in a federal court in San Francisco by Courtney McMillian, the former ""head of total rewards"" at the social media site, which Mr Musk renamed X. In the complaint, she said the firm had provided staff only one month's worth of pay as severance instead of the far more generous benefits, including at least two months of salary and contributions toward health insurance, that had been promised. Mr Musk's team had urged the judge to reject the complaint, saying that America's Employee Retirement Income Security Act did not apply as claimed.  The act sets standards for private health and pension plans. “We are disappointed in the ruling and considering our options for moving forward,”  a spokesperson for Ms McMillian's team said.  Other cases, including one brought by former leaders of the company, are still working their way through the courts.  In her ruling, Judge Thompson gestured to those disputes, noting that workers might have opportunities elsewhere to prove their claims. ""The Court lacks jurisdiction. However, plaintiffs are not without recourse. Indeed, there are other cases brought against Twitter for the failure to pay wages or provide employee severance benefits during the same or overlapping period,"" she wrote.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72vr64el8yo,"Natalie Sherman,",2024-07-10 18:09:52,
234,UAE police withdraw woman’s attempted suicide charge,"Police in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have withdrawn the charges against Irish woman Tori Towey and have closed the case, it has been confirmed. The 28-year-old from Roscommon was facing charges including attempted suicide and consuming alcohol and had her passport destroyed. She had been working as a flight attendant based in Dubai - the largest city in the UAE. The Dubai Public Prosecution has confirmed to the BBC that it has dropped the case. Radha Stirling, a lawyer and human rights advocate who runs the Detained in Dubai group, said Ms Towey and her mother were ""over the moon"" at the news. ""We are ever grateful for widespread support of the public, the media and the Irish government,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""We hope her transit at the airport will go smoothly and that no further attempts will be made to keep her in the country."" Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris said a travel ban preventing Ms Towey from leaving the UAE had been lifted. “The embassy will take Tori to the airport as soon as she is ready to go,” he told the Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament). ""The embassy will of course continue to follow up on the case which is still active as of now... and to thank our embassy for the work in relation to that"". Previously the taoiseach said it was ""utterly, utterly unacceptable how an Irish citizen is being treated"". Mr Harris also said he had spoken to Ms Towey and her mother, who is with her in the UAE. He went on to say Ms Towey had ""been the victim of male violence"". ""What Tori has been through is, I think, unimaginable for so many people here in this country, that a woman who has been the victim of a brutal attack found herself waking up not in a hospital, but in a police station,"" he said. On Wednesday, Ann Flynn, Ms Towey's aunt, told BBC Radio Foyle’s North West Today programme that Tori and her whole family had been through a huge ordeal but she hoped the end was now in sight. “The travel ban being lifted is a huge relief, I didn’t actually quite believe it when I heard it,” Ms Flynn said. “Hopefully they will be home tomorrow. They haven’t actually got a flight sorted yet and we are just waiting to hear next steps."" Ms Flynn praised everyone who helped highlight her niece's case. “When they arrive in Ireland, it will be such a relief,” she said. “We just want her home, we just want to start a new chapter with her.” The case came to international attention after it was raised by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald in the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament) on Tuesday. She said Ms Towey's mother had travelled to Dubai to be with her and that she ""wants to come home"". ""She has been the victim of the most gross domestic violence,"" Ms McDonald said. ""Her passport has been destroyed. There was a travel ban imposed on her."" The Irish government should make it ""absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way"", Ms McDonald told the Dáil, and that ""an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way"". The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the case and was providing consular assistance.

238,‘Dad tried to kill us’: The house fire that devastated Australia,"The night comes back in fragments: the sound of exploding glass, the frantic call made to police, the tiny shivering bodies emerging from the flames. Eve’s hand shakes as she pieces it together. She is sitting in her living room in Western Sydney, the burnt-out blackened shell of her neighbour's house - now a crime scene splashed across Australia’s national news - visible through the blinds. What happened on this quiet street in the early hours of Sunday morning is hard to reconcile. A fire that would leave three children dead - including a 5-month-old baby girl - and four more hospitalised alongside their mother. And a stunning allegation: that this horror - so evident in the wreckage left behind and on the faces of those who witnessed it - was inflicted on these children by their father, who then blocked their attempts to flee. New South Wales Police are treating the Lalor Park house fire as a domestic violence-related multiple homicide, and the state’s premier has said the 28-year-old father of seven could face “the most serious charges on offer”. The case, which has sparked mass outrage, comes while Australia is already in the grips of a self-declared “national crisis” of domestic and family violence -  a child is dying at the hands of a parent almost once a fortnight, according to research. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has offered a flurry of reforms and funding to stop the scourge. But he conceded on Tuesday - in response to a string of alleged killings this week - that the country “has a long way to go” to turn the tide: ""Again, we have seen lives stolen, futures torn away. Every death is its own universe of devastation.” Eve - who has asked to have her name changed due to safety concerns - still can’t come to terms with what happened. “We feel ashamed, we didn’t know there was a baby inside”, she told the BBC, erupting in tears as she begins offering a timeline of the fire. Somehow, she “blames herself” for the deaths of the children across the road because she didn’t notice the inferno sooner, didn’t call emergency services fast enough. And yet, her actions were both brave and consequential. She and her husband were alerted to the violence unfolding by another neighbour, Jarrod Hawkins, who came to their home looking for reinforcements. Mr Hawkins said he had been woken by a “loud pop” shortly before 01:00 local time (15:00 GMT). Worried his car might be being broken into, he went outside, and immediately saw the flames. He says he ran across the road without pausing to think and tried to beat the door down. In the moments that followed Mr Hawkins would crawl into the house repeatedly to pull out three children - two young boys aged four and seven, and a girl aged nine. An 11-year-old would eventually be rescued by police, along with two boys aged two and six found in a critical condition, who died a short time later in hospital. Mr Hawkins then woke up Eve and her family who phoned the authorities. Soon, Eve’s husband was on their neighbour’s lawn, trying to put out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. Eve helped usher some of the children from the scene - doing her best to calm them and keep them warm as they adjusted to the freezing air outside. She remembers one of the boys saying blankly at one point: “He tried to kill me”. Another rescuer would later tell a local paper they heard a similar remark from several of the tiny survivors: “Dad tried to kill us”. But it was an innocent exchange Eve shared with the four-year-old who escaped, as he looked back at the charred remains of his home, that stays with her. “He just kept asking whether his toys would be safe inside.” As emergency services started to take control of the scene, Eve took her cue to leave. One of the final things she witnessed was “police carrying the Dad out, who was in his underwear”.  She would soon learn that the 5-month-old girl had died before rescuers could attempt to revive her. Speaking to media later Sunday morning, Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty alleged the children’s father had tried to stop “police, responders and neighbours” from entering the burning house, “with the intention of keeping the kids inside”. “At this stage it does appear the 28-year-old is responsible for multiple deaths of young lives that have been tragically taken away,” Det Supt Doherty added. Now, a makeshift memorial lies on Freeman Street. The colourful flowers and cards offering messages of support stand in stark contrast to the police tape and forensics tent. Members of the community have described the children as “lively”, “outgoing” and “polite”. “They were known to a lot of people - those kids were unreal, great manners… full of energy, just typical kids,” Mr Hawkins had earlier told ABC News. “They were happy,” another neighbour says simply. As masked investigators sift through their house, an elderly resident watches on. Choked by tears, he literally can’t speak about his memories of the family.  Premier Chris Minns has called the tragedy a “deep wound” that will be widely felt. “These children deserved a loving home with safety and security - instead, they’re gone,” he added, promising that those who remain would get the support they needed. It is hard to say where Australia sits internationally on the issue, but filicide - when a parent intentionally kills their child - is the second most common form of domestic homicide in the country. In most cases, the families have a history of child abuse, intimate partner violence, or both, says a recent study by the national research organisation for women’s safety. State and federal governments have begun investing in prevention - which means examining the social drivers of violence - early intervention, bolstering crisis response networks, and supporting families as they recover. And Australia’s latest budget set aside A$1 bn (£526m; $673m) to assist with those aims. “My government is determined to end this violence. Together, we can make this change. We must,” Mr Albanese said on Tuesday, flagging a previous commitment to build 720 emergency safe houses by 2027 to accommodate women and children fleeing abuse. Critics though, have described the measure as a “drop in a very large ocean of need” - saying the money being spent doesn’t match the scale of the crisis. “[This] will accommodate at most a mere 3% of women and children seeking housing. Moreover, waiting three years for these facilities to be built is cold comfort to women and children being killed by family and domestic violence now,” Larissa Waters, the Senate leader for the Australian Greens said. The four children and their mother who survived the unimaginable events at Lalor Park are in a stable condition, while their father remains in an induced coma, under police guard. On Tuesday, authorities closed off the street so that the 29-year-old woman could be given a few quiet moments to grieve in private - as she took in the sight of her now unrecognisable home. Dressed in black, with a hospital band visible on her wrist, she picked up cards and floral tributes, as loved ones held her close.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3egwnq0veo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-10 07:09:52,
237,NBA star to become first black Greek Olympic flagbearer,"Greek basketball star Giannis Antetokounmpo is to become the first black athlete to bear the flag for Greece at the Olympics. The two-time NBA MVP will carry the flag alongside race walker Antigoni Ntrismpioti in Paris on 26 July. The Greek men’s basketball team qualified for its first Olympic Games since 2008, after beating Croatia in front of a home crowd in Piraeus on Sunday. The 29-year-old, who was drafted by Milwaukee Bucks in 2013 and led them to the 2021 NBA title, was in tears after the game.  ""It's an incredible feeling,"" he said after qualification. ""Since I was a kid I always wanted to play in the Olympic Games."" His journey to become Greece's Olympic flagbearer hasn't been an easy one. Antetokounmpo's parents emigrated to Greece from Nigeria. For the first 18 years of his life, Antetokounmpo could not travel outside Greece and was effectively stateless, having no papers either from Greece or Nigeria. He was eventually issued Greek citizenship in May 2013, less than two months before the NBA draft. Antetokounmpo spoke about his childhood in a recent interview with ESPN.  ""I used to sell things since I can remember myself, since I was six or seven years old. “I was always out of home trying as much as I could to help my mom and dad by selling watches, glasses, CDs, DVDs, and everything I could find. I was doing that until I turned 17 because I had to. I had no other choice. When I was selling all those things, I was the best seller."" But even after becoming a star in the US, Antetokounmpo encountered racism at home.  In a TNT documentary in 2020, he said: ""Greece is a country of white people, life can be difficult for someone with the colour of my skin. Or of another nationality. You go to a lot of neighbourhoods, and you face a lot of racism."" There was a backlash to his comments from some in Greece, including Konstantinos Kalemis, then-coordinator for refugee education in the Malakasa camp north of Athens, who used a range of racial slurs against Antetokounmpo and was fired as a result.  He has also faced discrimination from government officials. In 2018, Adonis Georgiadis, the current health minister, repeatedly mispronounced his name and falsely claimed he had been born in Africa instead of Greece. Antetokounmpo will be one of the first athletes to open the Games, as Greece - the birthplace of the Olympics - traditionally leads the parade. Spyros Kapralos, president of the Greek Olympic Committee, said there was ""unanimity"" in the decision for Antetokounmpo to carry the flag in Paris. He added that both flagbearers will ""lift our country high"". Antetokounmpo hasn't publicly commented yet, but simply posted a video to X showing highlights from the qualifying campaign with the word ""Greece"".

236,A photographer's 11-day trek to flee war-torn Sudan,"On the eve of his perilous escape from his home country last month, Sudanese photojournalist Mohamed Zakaria left his camera equipment with a friend, not sure if he would ever see it again. He was fleeing el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, which is in the grip of a punishing battle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Mohamed had been covering this hot spot of Sudan’s 15-month long civil war for the BBC. But with the situation growing increasingly desperate, he decided it was time to escape. The RSF escalated a siege of el-Fasher in May, targeting the last army foothold in Darfur. Shortly afterward Mohamed’s house was hit by a shell, another struck as he was trying to get wounded neighbours to hospital. Five people were killed and 19 injured - Mohamed still has pieces of shrapnel in his body, while his brother lost an eye. Two weeks later Mohamed watched his mother and three brothers depart for the safety of Chad, the neighbouring country to the west. He stayed behind to continue working to support them, he says. But as the RSF fighters continued to close in, civilians were trapped in a war zone of indiscriminate shelling and army airstrikes, with food supplies cut off. “I couldn’t move, I couldn’t work,” he says. “All you do now in el-Fasher is just stay in your home and wait for death… some residents had to dig trenches in their homes.” It was dangerous to stay, but also dangerous to flee. In the end he decided to head for South Sudan and eventually on to Uganda.  He thought this journey would be safer for him than trying to join his family in Chad, and would allow him to work once he got to his destination. From el-Fasher to South Sudan, Mohamed passed through 22 checkpoints, five manned by the army and 17 by the RSF.  He was searched and sometimes interrogated, but managed to conceal his identity as a cameraman who had documented the war.  Except for once. The first stop, on 10 June, was Zamzam refugee camp on the outskirts of el-Fasher.  Mohamed and his travelling companion, his cousin Muzamil, spent the night with a friend. Here he hid his camera and other tools of the trade.  But he took with him a precious record of his photographs and videos - stored on memory cards and in two external hard drives - as well as his laptop and phone. “The biggest problem I faced on the road was how I could hide them,” he said. “Because these are dangerous things. If the RSF or any soldier sees them, you can't explain.” For the first major leg of the trek, Mohamed stashed them in a hole under the foot pedals of the pickup, without telling the driver. He and Muzamil were held up at one checkpoint by Sudanese soldiers suspicious they were heading into RSF territory to join the enemy. But otherwise, they reached Dar es Salaam, the town that marked the end of army control, without incident. Here they joined other travellers - a convoy of six vehicles en route to the village of Khazan Jadid. “We paid the RSF soldiers to go with us,” says Mohamed. “If you want to arrive safely you need to pay the RSF.” The drivers collected money from the passengers and handed it over at the first checkpoint, where one of the RSF fighters got into each car. At this point Mohammed hid his memory cards in a piece of paper that he put with other documents. At the bus station in Khazan Jadid, Mohammed found only three vehicles. “The road was very dangerous,” he says, “and all the cars had stopped travelling.” But they managed to get one going to the city of el-Daein, the capital of East Darfur and they reached there in the early afternoon of 12 June. At a checkpoint in the middle of town, those coming from el-Fasher were put to one side, says Mohamed, under suspicion that they had worked with the army. Here’s where he ran into trouble. He had deleted all the messages, photographs and apps on his mobile phone.  But the RSF officer found a Facebook account he had forgotten to remove, complete with posts he had shared about the bombing of el-Fasher and the suffering of civilians. There followed an hours-long interrogation where Mohamed was separated from Muzamil and accused of being a spy. “I was threatened with torture and death unless I disclosed the information I had,” he says. “I felt lost. It was a very bad situation. If he wanted to kill you, he could do it and no-one would know. He can kill you, he can beat you, he can he can do anything to you.” Mohamed was finally released at 19:00 after negotiating the payment of a large sum of money. “This was the worst moment,” he says, reflecting on the experience, “not only in the journey but I think the worst moment in my whole life… because I didn’t see any hope. I can’t believe I’m here.” Mohamed suspected his interrogator would alert another checkpoint down the road to arrest him again.  He and Muzamil raced to the station to get out of town as fast as they could. There was only one vehicle, a pickup truck that was crammed full, but they managed to squeeze into a small space on the roof. They made it as far as the village of Abu Matariq, where the engine broke down and took two days to fix. Having survived arrest Mohamed was anxious to get to South Sudan as quickly as possible. Instead, he faced a lengthy delay. The travellers finally left Abu Matariq on 14 June heading to el-Raqabat, the last town in East Darfur before the border. The way led through the forest of el-Deim, a flat expanse of grass and sand sprinkled with acacia trees. Heavy rains slowed and then stopped their progress, as the pickup got stuck in the mud. They were stranded. “It was a severe ordeal,” says Mohamed.  “We spent nearly six days without drinkable water and food. We mostly relied on rainwater and dates.” In a stroke of luck, they were able to buy two sheep from passing shepherds. During the course of the journey, says Mohamed, he did not have trouble getting food. The RSF-controlled areas through which they passed had seen battles early in the war, but had stabilised somewhat since then.  Markets and small restaurants were operating. Food was expensive, but not “super expensive” like in el-Fasher, where many people were forced to ration themselves to one meal a day. In the forest, the men slept in the open, sometimes in the rain, while the two women and two children in the party stayed inside the vehicle. They had to pick thorns out of their feet from walking without shoes in the mud. Eventually they pushed the pickup back onto solid ground. But the engine worked only sporadically because of a weak battery. And then it ran out of fuel. At this point two of the men set off to find the nearest village. It turned out to be a nine-hour walk. To everyone’s relief they returned late in the day with extra fuel and another vehicle. Arriving in el-Raqabat, Mohamed and Muzamil were just a 15-minute drive from South Sudan and safety. But the next morning before the travellers could start out, they were picked up and taken to the main RSF office and interrogated for three hours. Someone had reported that members of the Zaghawa ethnic group had entered the town. That included Mohamed, as well as the family sharing the car with him.  The Zaghawa make up one of the armed groups fighting alongside the army in el-Fasher, and the RSF view them as enemies. Mohamed stashed his memory cards, hard drives and laptop with one of the women and told the RSF officer that he was a computer engineer. Once again it came down to a pay-off: 30,000 Sudanese pounds ($50; £39) from everyone. Mohamed and a few other members of the group paid extra to release another man who had been found with a photo of an army soldier on his phone. Then Mohamed and Muzamil clambered into a motorised rickshaw and headed for the border. Crossing into South Sudan on 20 June was an “unbelievable” moment for Mohamed. “When I saw the South Sudanese men, I thanked God and prayed,” he says. “I felt I'm alive. I really didn't believe that I am alive, that I am here. I reached South Sudan with all my data and my laptop, even though I had many encounters with the RSF.” He called his mother as soon as he was able to buy a local SIM card. “She didn't believe that I was alive,” he says. Mohamed had been out of internet range for 11 days, and his family had no idea where he was or what was happening to him during that time. “They were very very worried,” he says. “Most of them had told me you must not try this road, don’t go, you can't make it.” But he had made it. He stopped in the South Sudanese city of Aweil for a few days, where the Zaghawa family he had been travelling with hosted him in their home.  He then moved on to the capital, Juba.  Muzamil decided to stay there, but Mohamed travelled to Uganda and registered as a refugee at a camp near the border because his passport had expired. Twenty-three days after leaving el-Fasher, Mohamed arrived in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on 3 July. He is staying with his uncle. “I honestly have no idea where life will take me from this point,” he says. His immediate priority is to look after his family and try to reunite them. Besides his mother and three brothers in Chad, he has a brother in Turkey and a sister in the United Arab Emirates. His dream for the future is to return to Sudan in more peaceful times and set up a university in Darfur to teach filmmaking, photography and media studies. “My work did not end after leaving el-Fasher,” he says. “I believe that was just a phase and now I have really begun arranging the second phase by working to convey the truth of the situation there.  ""I hope that my effort, even if just a little, will help shorten the duration of the war and save the people in el-Fasher.” Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

235,What are cognitive tests and what can they tell us about Biden and Trump?,"Age and mental fitness recently have become a leading issue in the US presidential race.  While the issue has loomed over President Joe Biden, 81, and his opponent Donald Trump, 78, in the past, things reached a tipping point after Biden's weak debate performance late last month.  Mr Biden is the oldest president in US history and Trump, if elected, would be the second oldest.  Mr Biden, during an interview with ABC News, refused to commit to taking a cognitive test, saying he has ""a cognitive test every day"" and his doctors say he doesn't need one.  Trump has said he has completed cognitive tests, one while he was president, and another more recently. He said he aced both.  Here's what the tests are, their purpose and how hard they are to pass.  There are different tests and screenings to measure how well the brain is functioning.  They don't determine a specific disease, but help signal if additional tests are needed for diagnosis, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  Typically, a cognitive screening could be warranted if a person is having problems with memory, personality changes, or balance, or if they are repeating themself, forgetting parts of their past or having problems understanding information.  One of the most widely used tests is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a quick way to ""assess cognitive skills in people with suspected deficits,"" according to Sanford Medicine.  The assessment tests orientation, memory, attention and the ability to name objects, and follow verbal and written commands. It's also available online.  It's typically easy for someone without cognitive impairment, but is harder for those declining mentally.  The creator of the test, Canadian neurologist Ziad Nasreddine, told the BBC that he thought the test could be good for Biden - both as a way to reassure Americans and in case there is a problem.  In brief cognitive tests, medical professionals ask patients a variety of learning and memory questions. Longer clinical evaluations include cognitive tests plus a physical and neurological exam and a full history of a patient.  The latter could paint a clearer picture of the cognitive abilities of both Mr Biden and Trump, said Dan Mungas, an associate director of the University of California's Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.  Often medical professions will start with a brief test, such as the MoCa, and if their score is lower than expected, they move to a more comprehensive examination.  More in-depth tests assess language, executive function and visual-spatial abilities.  For example, a medical professional may read a story to a patient then ask them to recall parts of the story to test memory and learning abilities.  A patient might be asked to recall a list of words, name objects in pictures or name items that start with a specific letter.  In addition to questioning the patient, Dr Mungas suggests speaking with people who spend time with the patient regularly to determine symptoms of cognitive decline. Dr Mungas said it is important to see if someone's abilities have changed over time, adding that a one-time assessment can be misleading.   ""You have to understand where a person started out, if they're declining from where they've been before, that's a bad sign,"" he said.  But he notes, cognitive tests are not everything.  ""The idea that there’s a simple cognitive test that says this person's going to be a good president doesn’t make any sense and I’ve been doing cognitive testing all my career,” Dr Mungas said.  The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends doctors assess people older than 65 for their cognitive abilities. That determination was made because as age increases, so does the likelihood of impairments, Dr Nasreddine told the BBC.  By age 75, 25% of patients will have a cognitive disorder of some kind, he warned.  ""It becomes extremely frequent that cognitive impairment is present, and sometimes it’s present without people realising it’s present,” said Dr Nasreddine, who has neither treated nor met the president. He said he has noticed a change in Mr Biden in the past year. In public appearances, the president moves slowly, his speech has slowed, his voice is very low, and he mumbles and slurs some words, he said.  Not many people have such an intense job at Mr Biden's age, he noted, and it is difficult to describe the normal function of someone at that age. ""I haven't seen this [decline] in previous years, only in the past year I have seen this,"" he said.   Dr Nasreddine noted that, despite only being three years younger, Trump seems more vigorous.  The 25th Amendment of the US Constitution lays out the line of succession and procedure if a president dies or is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"".  The amendment notes it should be used if a president is removed from office, incapacitated, dies or resigns.  The amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy but has become a topic of debate in recent years.  Congressional lawmakers eyed legislation during Trump's presidency that would alter the amendment to enable a panel of medical experts to determine a president's fitness for office.  Democrats also approved a House resolution after the US Capitol riots in 2021 that called for then-Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.  Neither move went anywhere.  Following Mr Biden's debate performance, some Republicans have called on members of his cabinet to invoke the clause.  Section 4 of the amendment states if the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet or Congress deem the president is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,"" then the vice-president would take office.  It has never been used or tested in the case of mental decline. ",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngrlnlr08o,"Ana Faguy and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-09 23:09:52,

239,More than 40 activists jailed for life in UAE for 'terror' offences,"A court in the United Arab Emirates has handed life sentences to 43 activists after finding them guilty of terror offences.  State media said the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal convicted the defendants of ""creating a terrorist organisation"".  United Nations experts and human rights groups have severely criticised the mass trial. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said more than 80 human rights defenders and political dissidents - known as the ""UAE 84"" - were put on trial. Last January, the UAE's prosecutor general referred the defendants to the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal on charges of ""establishing another clandestine organisation for the purpose of committing acts of violence and terrorism on UAE soil"" known as the ""Justice and Dignity Committee"".  He said most of the defendants were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UAE since 2014. Its local affiliate, the al-Islah party, is also banned. According to the official WAM news agency, on Wednesday the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal ""sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment for the crime of creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation"". In addition to the 43 life sentences handed out, 10 other defendants were jailed for 10 to 15 years in prison on the charges of ""co-operating with al-Islah"" and money laundering, WAM said. One defendant was acquitted and 24 cases were ruled inadmissible, it added. The bulk of the defendants have been in prison for more than a decade after they were jailed as part of the ""UAE 94"" trial in 2013, according to HRW and Amnesty International.  Many had already completed their sentences. But UAE authorities said the latest charges were ""materially distinct"" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a ""terrorist organisation"", AFP news agency reported. According to Amnesty International, the indictment, charges, defence lawyers and names of defendants were ""kept secret by the government"". It said details were only known through ""leaks"". HRW identified three of those sentenced to life in prison were Nasser bin Ghaith, Abdulsalam Darwish al-Marzouqi and Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi. Prominent activist Ahmed Mansoor was among the defendants, it added. Reacting to the sentencings, Amnesty International’s Devin Kenney urged the UAE to ""urgently revoke this unlawful verdict"" and called on those sentenced to be released. ""The trial has been a shameless parody of justice and violated multiple fundamental principles of law, including the principle that you cannot try the same person twice for the same crime, and the principle that you cannot punish people retroactively under laws that didn’t exist at the time of the alleged offence."" Khalid Ibrahim of the Gulf Center for Human Rights, on whose board Ahmed Mansoor sits, said: ""It is a real tragedy that so many activists and human rights defenders will remain in prison for decades, deprived of watching their children grow up, for no other reason than calling for a better future for Emiratis."" Despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the Middle East and promoting high-tech sectors and innovations, the UAE remains restrictive on political activity. The federation of seven emirates, which include Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has no official opposition and bans political parties. In 2013, almost 70 Islamists were given jail sentences over an alleged plot to overthrow the government.",2024-07-10 23:09:52,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y783d9jeo,"Thomas Mackintosh,",2024-07-10 18:09:52,
247,'Beginning of two legends': Photos of Messi and baby Lamine Yamal resurface,"In 2007, a young Lionel Messi posed for photos with a baby in the dressing room of the Camp Nou in Barcelona for a charity calendar photoshoot. Messi, who was 20, was already making a name for himself and would go on to become arguably the greatest of all time. But little did the photographer know that the baby would also make waves in international football less than 17 years later. Messi was bathing Lamine Yamal - the 16-year-old who is taking the European Championships by storm.  His goal against France in the semi-final on Tuesday is one that will be talked about for decades.  At 16 years and 362 days, the strike also made him the youngest man to score in the tournament's history. The long-forgotten photo of Messi and Yamal resurfaced after Yamal’s father posted it on Instagram last week with the text: “The beginning of two legends.” The photos were taken by Joan Monfort, who works as a freelance photographer for the Associated Press. The shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataró where Lamine’s family lived, he said. ""They signed up for the raffle to have their picture taken at the Camp Nou with a Barça player. And they won the raffle,"" Mr Monfort told the Associated Press. The assignment wasn't a straightforward one, the photographer said. “Messi is a pretty introverted guy, he’s shy,” he said. “He was coming out of the locker room and suddenly he finds himself in another locker room with a plastic tub full of water and a baby in it. It was complicated. He didn’t even know how to hold him at first.” Like Messi, Yamal went on to play for Barcelona, where he became the club's youngest ever starter and goalscorer, as well as the youngest scorer in the Spanish league.  Mr Monfort said it was only when the photo started going viral online last week that he realised that the baby was Yamal. “It’s very exciting to be associated with something that has caused such a sensation,” he said.  “To tell you the truth it’s a very nice feeling.”",2024-07-10 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7206gj5w28o,"George Wright,",2024-07-10 07:09:53,
248,From a small village to Bollywood success: 'I'm blessed',"When Punjabi rapper Karan Aujla reflects on his journey so far, he admits it is ""hard to process"". Born in Punjab, his parents died when he was a child and he later moved to Canada ""with just this skill of writing"". The 27-year-old will be touring the UK and Canada in months to come, and his recent release Tauba Tauba will appear in Bad Newz – the first time he has a track in a Bollywood film. ""I'm blessed,"" he tells BBC Asian Network’s Haroon Rashid. ""Coming from such a small village and making it across the globe and getting so much love from people and touring. ""Getting to experience things that you never even knew existed."" Karan’s hits such as Softly, Don’t Look, Red Eyes and On Top have spent multiple weeks in the Official Asian Music Chart and he has more than 13 million monthly Spotify listeners. He is considered one of the most important artists taking Punjabi music global, along with Diljit Dosanjh and AP Dhillon. Karan has previously spoken about having Bollywood offers, but wanting to wait for the right one. ""It was so quick, we decided that we wanted a song for the movie. And I made two ideas, sent them over and they picked one."" ""And I'm happy that they did. It just goes with the vibe of the movie. ""I never felt out of place, the whole team showed me so much love,"" he adds. There’s sometimes been criticism that to fit into Bollywood, artists need to change their style. ""My first thought was to go with a little bit of Hindi. Then I was like OK, that’s not me."" ""It was hard deciding which direction the sound should be… but it just happened like that."" Karan says he is conscious about being original but also offering things for different audiences. The inspiration behind the song was a friend who is ""into Punjabi music"" and the song is about a ""love for Punjabi music"". ""I really wanted it to be easy to catch for the people that don't know Punjabi too much. But I also wanted to keep it [Punjabi] and not have it like a Bollywood sound"". ""I want to keep my own tone original,"" he says. ""It just makes me so happy that the language barrier is gone and it’s all about music. ""It's going global,” he says of Punjabi music. Karan says he has a relaxed approach to making music and takes pride in not overthinking things, describing that as ""a big flex"". ""Every time I get into the studio, I don’t know what I’m going to write about. I just sit there, listen to the beats, make melodies and it just comes. ""I'm really proud of it, because that's how I started as a writer."" Despite increasing success over the years, Karan says he doesn’t ""get nervous"" in the typical way, but that it is ""a different type of feeling"". ""Sometimes you don’t know how it’s going to be when you enter these new rooms. ""But everybody loves your talent if you’re good."" One of the things that helps is the people around him, and he says he is big on brotherhood in the industry. ""It’s really important for me because I grew up around brothers and friendship has had a big role in my career."" But he is forward looking as well, and has the tour on his mind with many fans expected to turn out to see him perform. He reveals that it will be ""a different"" sound to his previous tour, with greater production involved. ""This time I’m coming out with a new band, and nobody is Punjabi. ""Even if I have to put money out of my own pocket, I want to make sure people have the best time of their lives."" ""I’m doing some crazy stuff,"" he teases. With his music though, Karan says he’s just ""trying to go with the flow"". He name-checks Burna Boy and Wizkid as artists who he feels have a sound that ""is so clean"". But his own approach will remain pretty chilled out. ""I will never plan things… it just happens. ""That’s the best way to do anything in life.""

249,What is Nato and which countries are members?,"Sir Keir Starmer is attending the Nato summit in Washington DC - his first international trip since becoming prime minister. In a speech to mark the 75th anniversary of the military alliance on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said Nato was ""more powerful than ever"" and that it faced a ""pivotal moment"", with the war between Russia and Ukraine.  Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, UK, Canada and France.  Its founding treaty was signed in Washington DC, and leaders of Nato countries marked the anniversary on the first day of the summit, which is taking place between 9 - 11 July. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato's primary purpose, external was to block expansion in Europe by the Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it., external Nato does not have an army of its own, but member countries can take collective military action in response to crises.  The alliance supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004, external. It also coordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises, external. Biden forcefully defends Nato as he hosts summit leaders Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America, including the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey.  After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries joined: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Both had applied to join in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, having been neutral for decades. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia also hope to join Nato.  How Sweden and Finland went from neutral to Nato Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, Nato said that Ukraine could eventually join, external.  After Russia's invasion, Ukraine's President Zelensky asked for his country to be admitted as soon as possible.  Outgoing Nato secretary-general Mr Stoltenberg previously said it was ""inevitable"" that Ukraine would become a member, but not until its war with Russia ends.  Outgoing Nato boss Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" Since July 2023, the US-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group, external has been coordinating efforts to give Ukraine weapons and training to defend itself against Russia.  Nato is proposing to take over that role by creating a $100bn fund, external to support Ukraine over the next five years. In 2022, Nato said the Russian invasion of Ukraine posed the ""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"", external. Nato has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country, for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia.  However, individual members have supplied arms to help Ukraine defend itself.  The German research organisation the Kiel Institute, external says the US has allocated 50.4bn euros (£42.6bn) for military support to Ukraine, while European countries - Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK - have allocated 32bn euros (£27bn).  The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have provided anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles. Nato countries are supplying Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine Speaking at the Washington summit, President Joe Biden said the US would partner with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Romania to donate Patriot missile batteries and other systems to bolster Ukraine's air defences.  This follows Russian air attacks across Ukraine on 8 July which destroyed a children's hospital in Kyiv and killed 43 people across the country, according to officials. President Zelensky has spent months pleading with his Western allies for more weapons.  Earlier in 2024, supplies of US munitions dried up after a bill to give more military support to Ukraine was delayed for several months. European weapons makers were unable to fill the gap.  The US is letting two Nato countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, send US-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. The first planes are expected to arrive later this summer. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? In 2023, Nato commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks anywhere in the Arctic and north Atlantic, central Europe, or the Mediterranean region.  It has increased the number of troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000.  The alliance has also bolstered its defences on Russia's borders with eight battlegroups, external. Nato asks every member country to spend at least 2% of its national income on defence, and 23 of them are projected to meet that target in 2024. Only three did in 2014. The biggest spenders (in proportion to the size of their economies) are the US and countries close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic Republics. Nato's European members and Canada collectively increased their defence spending by an estimated 9% in 2023, and are forecast to increase it by another 18% in 2024, external. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak committed the UK to increasing its military budget to 2.5% of national income from the current 2.3%.  Speaking on the way to the Washington summit, Sir Keir Starmer insisted his Labour government will honour that pledge.  However, the new armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, has not said when the target will be met. When he was US President, Donald Trump pushed European Nato members to boost their defence spending.  During the current presidential election campaign, Mr Trump - who is the presumptive Republican nominee - warned that if he was re-elected, he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough. Mr Stoltenberg said his suggestion ""undermines all of our security"". At a campaign rally on Tuesday, Mr Trump told supporters that Nato countries were now contributing ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" more because he had warned them: ""No, I will not protect you from Russia"" unless they paid more to the alliance.

250,First peek at room behind Buckingham Palace's famous balcony,"Instead of that famous view looking up at the Buckingham Palace balcony, visitors for the first time will be able to look down from the inside. After five years of renovations, the east wing of the palace has been carefully restored and on a trial basis is open to paying customers from next week. But they won't be able to step out on to the balcony itself - and when you visit you can see why. It's surprisingly narrow and the railings are below waist height, in a way that would send any health and safety officers into a royal panic. But looking through the windows - and what royal author Robert Hardman has called ""the most famous net curtains in the world"" - you can see the view from the perspective of the King and Queen, Prince William and Catherine. What's surprising from this vantage point is how clearly you can see the crowds of tourists below, you can really see people's faces. There's also the curiosity of the change of perspective - looking out across the pink gravel of the courtyard and towards the Mall, rather than the usual view from outside the gates looking in. To get to the balcony the royals go through the Centre Room, elaborately decorated in a Chinese style, and now open to the public for the first time since this wing was built 175 years ago. A huge lamp fitting hangs down, decorated in the style of a lily, and the walls are covered in Chinese-themed art.  The royal world loves its acronyms. So Buckingham Palace is ""BP"" and Kensington Palace is ""KP"" - but this enthusiasm for Chinese and oriental art is connected to another BP. That's the Brighton Pavilion, because building the east wing of Buckingham Palace was funded by Queen Victoria selling off the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. That seaside retreat was a fusion of Asian styles and racy regency fashions and, always keen on recycling, the 19th Century royals removed the Chinese and Japanese-themed furniture and art and put it into Buckingham Palace. That included the fixtures and fittings, such as doors, gilded curtain poles and a fireplace, as well as ornamental porcelain pagodas. The introduction of tours to this previously private section of the palace is part of a broader ambition to make royal residences more open to the public. The east wing, getting its first tourists, is the main facade of the palace, where tourists gather outside to watch Changing of the Guard - it's the view you see on the postcards. It's not cheap to look round, costing £75, but has already completely sold out for this year. And this summer's inaugural visitors will be in guided groups of 20, separate to the existing more general tour of the palace's state rooms. In this more intimate version of the tour, none of the items on show are roped off from visitors. The furniture doesn't have 'keep off' signs. It makes it feel more like a living building rather than a museum, but there's no escaping the gradual gift-shopification of the palace.  It's a mix of an historic setting for grand events, an office block and a tourist attraction, but at the moment it still seems a way off from being where any of the royals are likely to live. Visiting royals don't stay here either any more. During their recent state visit the Emperor and Empress of Japan stayed in Claridge's Hotel. There is an ongoing £369m project to renovate the palace complex, not just the gilded surfaces, but the basics of the plumbing and wiring on what is a huge set of ageing buildings. Once you step away from the glitzy state rooms you never seem far from scaffolding and repair works. Renovating the east wing alone meant removing and conserving 3,500 separate items, including historic furniture and works of art. And the tour only includes only a relatively small part of that wing. But the sell-out tours show the public demand and while there will be art lovers among the visitors, people will also be coming to see for themselves something they might have watched on television or imagined through the Crown. They can stand in the elegant Yellow Drawing room, used for many audiences and the setting of a Christmas broadcast by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Or visitors can look out of the window at the quadrangle below, where Sir Keir Starmer pulled up last week when he went to meet the King after winning the general election. There's plenty of royal bling on show in the long corridors, but it's the sense of seeing behind the scenes in the palace that will draw people. And when they look out through the long balcony windows, they might resist the temptation to give a little wave.",2024-07-10 23:09:53,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn38z155yrpo,"Sean Coughlan,",2024-07-10 00:09:53,
251,Attempted carjacker shot outside top US judge's home,"A Deputy US Marshal shot a would-be carjacker while he was guarding Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s home in Washington DC, authorities said. The man was shot after approaching the car the officer was sitting in and tapping the window with a gun.  The deputy fired several times, hitting the suspect in the mouth. A second deputy also opened fire, but did not hit the man, police said. Justice Sotomayor’s home is not believed to have been a deliberately targeted. The suspected carjacker, named in charging documents as Kentrell Flowers, 18, is being treated in hospital and faces carjacking and firearms charges. The two deputies have not been identified. Court documents said Mr Flowers had emerged from a silver minivan - which had been stolen earlier in the evening - and approached the officers' car.  Court documents said the two officers were wearing US Marshals branded polo shirts and T-shirts during the incident.  The teenage suspect was charged with armed carjacking, carrying a pistol without a licence, and possession of a large capacity magazine. Magazines with over 10-round capacity are illegal in Washington DC. An investigation into the alleged attempted carjacking is underway, but police said there was no indication the suspect knew who he had approached, or that he was near Justice Sotomayor's home. The driver of the minivan fled the scene, with the minivan found abandoned later.  Vehicle thefts and carjackings were a serious issue in the US capital, but there has been a 43% decrease in such incidents this year, Metro police figures show.  In 2023, a US Secret Service agent shot at two teenagers - aged 14 and 19 - who broke into a car assigned to protect Naomi Biden, the granddaughter of US President Joe Biden. And Rep Henry Cuellar - a Democrat from Texas - was carjacked last year in the Navy Yard area of the city.

252,Prominent New Zealand couple targeted in deadly US robbery,"A prominent New Zealand couple visiting California were targeted as they left a shopping centre by a crew of suspected robbers who left one of the pair dead. The couple - banker Doug and Patricia “Trish” McKay - had been shopping at Newport Beach's Fashion Island when they were attacked by a group of men on 2 July, officials said. Ms McKay, 68, a friend of New Zealand's prime minister, was killed when she was dragged along a road in the ensuing events, the Orange County District Attorney's Office added. Three suspects have been charged with murder.  Detailing the incident, which took place about 45 miles (72km) south-east of Los Angeles, the DA said two men wearing masks jumped out of a vehicle as the couple waited to be picked up.  They allegedly pointed a gun at Mr McKay's head, ordered him to the ground and demanded he hand over the expensive watch he was wearing. One man attacked Ms McKay, trying to take her shopping bags. He is accused of throwing her to the ground and dragging her into the road. Mr McKay jumped in front of the car and tried to stop his wife from being run over, but a third man driving the car accelerated, the DA's news release stated. The car pushed Mr McKay out of the way but the trio dragged his wife 65 ft (20m) under the vehicle, killing her. A bystander tried to stop the group from fleeing and was shot at by one of the men during the incident. The suspects allegedly led authorities on a high-speed chase for nearly 40 miles. They were arrested and identified as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, and Jaden Cunningham, 18. All three were charged with murder with a felony enhancement that makes them eligible for the death penalty, according to the DA's office. One of the suspects, Mr McCrary, is also facing charges of second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly. It is unclear who is legally representing each of the men. Doug McKay, 69, is a prominent businessman and banker in New Zealand. He was the first CEO of the Auckland Council, a body established in 2010 that helps govern the Auckland Region of the country.   He was also the former chair of the Bank of New Zealand, according to the Los Angeles Times.  The family released a statement to local media, saying: ""No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss"".  The couple's personal friend, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, paid tribute.  ""My thoughts are with the McKay family after the devastating loss of Trish,"" Mr Luxon posted on X. ""They’re great people and my heart goes out to Doug, their family and all those who knew Trish."" Desley Simpson, the deputy mayor of Auckland, said on Facebook that she was ""in absolute shock"".

253,Man caught smuggling 100 snakes in his trousers,"A man tried to smuggle more than 100 live snakes into mainland China by stuffing them in his trousers, according to custom officials. The unnamed traveller was stopped after passing through the ""nothing to declare"" gate at the crossing between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and the city of Shenzhen, officials said. Upon inspection, he had 104 snakes in “six canvas drawstring bags"" inside his trousers, a statement from China Customs said. “Each bag was found to contain living snakes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and colours,” it added. Video released by Chinese customs shows a pair of agents peering into transparent plastic bags filled with live red, pink and white snakes.  They were mostly small, but it is a large and squirmy haul of slithering reptiles for anyone to carry in their trousers.  Strict biosecurity and disease control laws forbid people from bringing in non-native species without permission into the country. “Those who break the rules will be… held liable in accordance with the law,” the customs authority said, without specifying the man’s punishment.

254,Lena Dunham pulls out of directing Polly Pocket,"Lena Dunham has dropped out of directing a film about the Polly Pocket dolls, saying she didn't think she could replicate what Greta Gerwig achieved with Barbie. The actor and director told The New Yorker: ""I'm not going to make the Polly Pocket movie. I wrote a script, and I was working on it for three years."" Dunham, who created and starred in US TV comedy Girls, was enlisted to direct the Polly Pocket film in 2021. It was also announced that Emily In Paris star Lily Collins would play the lead doll. Robbie Brenner, the producer who runs toy company Mattel's film division, told Variety last year that the script was ""great"" and Dunham ""is so collaborative and rolls up her sleeves and really likes to roll around in notes and listen"". However, Dunham has now said she would struggle to put her own personal stamp on it in the way Gerwig did with Barbie. Barbie took $1.44bn (£1.2bn) at the box office, making Gerwig the most successful solo female director ever. ""I think Greta did this incredible feat, which was to make this thing that was literally candy to so many different kinds of people and was perfectly and divinely Greta,"" Dunham added. ""And I just - I felt like, unless I can do it that way, I’m not going to do it. ""I don’t think I have that in me. ""I feel like the next movie I make needs to feel like a movie that I absolutely have to make. No-one but me could make it. ""And I did think other people could make Polly Pocket."" Polly Pocket is just one of the films Mattel has in the pipeline following Barbie's success.  Other projects include Barney, produced by Get Out actor Daniel Kaluuya, and Hot Wheels, produced by Star Wars and Star Trek director JJ Abrams. Despite Dunham's withdrawal, a Mattel spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter they still hope to make the Polly Pocket film. Dunham is currently working on Too Much, a Netflix series loosely based on her life, with her husband musician Luis Felber. The plot follows the lead character, played by Megan Stalter, meeting a punk musician, played by Will Sharpe, in London after a break-up in New York.

257,From Weston to Euro 2024 final - Watkins' 'unbelievable' moment,"This video can not be played Watkins score late winner for England ""I've been waiting for that moment for weeks,"" said Ollie Watkins afterwards - and boy did he take it. With the clock about to hit 90:00 in England's Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands, with the score at 1-1 in Dortmund, the ball fell to the striker from Devon, who was still playing in the English Football League just over four years ago at the age of 24. The Aston Villa man turned Stefan de Vrij and hammered a shot into the bottom corner for one of the most important England goals ever scored. Rewind nine years and he had just finished a loan spell at non-league Weston-super-Mare from League Two Exeter City. Asked after his Dortmund heroics whether he could have imagined this at the time, he said: ""You can dream but I am a realist. I was just focused on getting back into the first team at Exeter. ""I didn't dream about that to be honest. I can't lie and say I did. Scoring for England is amazing but I didn't think I'd do it in a tournament like that."" Watkins' winning goal more than justified Gareth Southgate's decision to choose him to replace England's all-time top scorer Harry Kane, with nine minutes to go. He came on alongside Cole Palmer, who set up his goal. ""I was wondering when the changes were going to happen. The changes were right and they were perfect,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Radio 5 Live. Former Brentford striker Watkins had only played 20 minutes at a major tournament before this, in the group stage against Denmark, having been left out of the Euro 2020 and 2022 World Cup squads. ""When I was on the bench I said to [sub keeper] Dean Henderson, 'I can make a difference today and need to get on'. I took my chance, scored it and now we are in the final. One last game,"" he said. That game is against Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final - as England bid to be European champions for the first time in men's football. This video can not be played 'The best feeling ever!' - Watkins on scoring England winner Unlike many England players, Watkins started his career lower in the football pyramid - at Exeter City. ""He had the perfect attitude, the perfect character and physical ability. He had all the boxes ticked yet, at 17, 18, 19 years old he never played as well as he should have done,"" said Paul Tisdale, Watkins' first manager at Exeter. At the age of 18, mostly playing on the wing, Watkins had made four first-team appearances for City before being sent on loan to Weston-super-Mare in the Conference South, the sixth tier. He scored 10 goals in 18 starts there - and broke into the Exeter team, as a striker. ""Suddenly the engine turned on. I've never seen a player have a quantum shift in their output as much as Ollie did,"" said Tisdale. He left for Championship Brentford in 2017 for £1.8m having scored 26 goals in 78 appearances for Exeter. Another 49 goals followed in 143 games for the Bees before he became the most expensive Championship player ever when he joined Aston Villa for £28m three years later. In this squad, only Ivan Toney - his rival for the spot to replace Kane late in games - has played more EFL games.  League games only (including play-offs) Watkins has kicked on at Villa with 70 goals in 169 games, hitting 19 Premier League goals last season to take his club into the Champions League. Dean Smith, who managed him at Brentford and Villa, said: ""I look at him now - he has become more of a selfish player, which is a good thing. ""His biggest strength could be his biggest weakness. He could beat himself up over things but it would also drive him. ""His emotional control now allows him to accept 'I will miss chances but I’ll be ready for the next one'."" Just last month Watkins said: ""Even when I first went to Villa, I'd just been bought for £30m and I was still unsure whether I deserved to be there.  ""I hadn't done it in the Premier League, so I would say there was a bit of that before. But now I'm in a really good place. ""I had a really good year, got the most assists in the league, scored a lot of goals and people still weren't including me in their squads to come to the Euros. ""Everyone has their own opinion, but I don't feel like I have that big profile where I'm talked about. Or where if I was left out of the squad, people would be like: 'Oh, I can't believe they didn't pick Ollie Watkins.' ""I'm happy I'm here now."" And so is Gareth Southgate. ""Ollie has trained every day and been ready to play, as the whole group has been,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new players in the group. Half have not been to a tournament but they have bonded so well, got each other's back and tonight was a good example of that."" Watkins' goal - timed at 89:59 - was the latest winning goal scored in a European Championship or World Cup semi-final, excluding extra time. It came with one of only 10 touches Watkins has had in the tournament. ""We talk about being ready,"" said Kane. ""We're a big team at being ready.  ""When it matters, you might get five minutes, one minute, but you can make a difference, you can win us a tournament. He's been waiting, he's been patient.  ""What he did was outstanding and he deserves it."" Ex-England striker Ian Wright was impressed watching the game for ITV. ""This is what Ollie Watkins does. This is the exact attitude I would want to have,"" he said.  ""You want Cole Palmer to come on and hit a pass that is perfect. In the moment, get back to the basics. It was absolutely perfect. Nobody did that to those defenders all night. They had an easy ride until he came on. ""Unbelievable moment. That's what you have come on to do - just take a shot. What's the worst that can happen? Ollie Watkins has done brilliantly. ""He's waited for his opportunity and he's done it. Now we're into the final. It's just amazing.""",2024-07-10 23:09:54,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c134enzzg26o,Emlyn Begley,2024-07-10 22:53:54,
258,Trial told dying girl offered prayer not medicine,"Members of an Australian religious group have gone on trial accused of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl by denying her medical care and offering prayer instead. Elizabeth Struhs was found dead at a home in Toowoomba - about 125km (78 mi) west of Brisbane - in January 2022, after she had allegedly gone without insulin for several days. Prosecutors say the sect shunned the use of medicine and trusted God to “heal” the child - “extreme beliefs” which had already almost ended Elizabeth’s life in similar circumstances three years before. The girl's parents are among the 14 defendants, all of whom have refused lawyers.  They have also all opted to enter no pleas on the charges. Formally, the court considers that a plea of not guilty. Two men - Elizabeth’s father Jason Struhs, 52, and the religious group’s leader Brendan Stevens, 62 - have been charged with murder, with prosecutors saying they knew the group's actions would likely kill Elizabeth. The girl's mother, Kerrie Struhs, 49, brother Zachary Struhs, 21, and ten others - aged 22 to 67 - are accused of manslaughter. As the trial began at the Queensland Supreme Court on Wednesday, the group filed in one by one, clad in prison clothes, taking their allocated positions in a courtroom specifically modified to fit them all. Due to the complexity and notoriety of the case, the trial is being heard by a judge only - no jury - and is expected to last for around three months. When opening her case, prosecutor Caroline Marco said Elizabeth had been an ""intelligent, spiritual child"". ""But [she was] too young to understand the dire consequences of her parents' decision... which she ultimately paid for with her own life.” Ms Marco alleged that in early January 2022, both parents made the decision to first reduce the amount of insulin given to their daughter, and then withdraw it completely. Members of the sect then gathered at the home to pray, she said, and it was “visible to all who saw her” that Elizabeth’s health was in danger. But there was “no attempt” to get a doctor. She later died after having ""suffered for days"" , said the prosecutor.  The court heard Mrs Struhs had only been out of prison for a few weeks, after being convicted of failing to provide insulin to her daughter on another occasion in 2019. That time, the girl spent a month in hospital after medical treatment was eventually sought by her father. Jason Struhs previously had not agreed with the group's beliefs, the judge was told, but had been baptised while his wife was in prison. “He knew if he did not change he would lose his family and wife so pushed aside convictions of faith he once held, and joined them,"" Ms Marco said. Over the course of the trial, the court would hear from 60 witnesses including one of the Struhs' daughters, who is estranged from the family, Ms Marco said. The evidence, she added, would paint a picture of a small and “insular” religious group which centred around Brendan Stevens. Prosecutors will continue laying out their arguments on Thursday, after which the defendants will also have the opportunity to address the court. Before the trial began, Justice Martin Burn said stressed that he was obliged to provide sufficient information to ensure they got a fair trial, but could not provide them with legal advice.",2024-07-10 23:09:54,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c97dq22nj0lo,"Simon Atkinson,",2024-07-10 09:09:54,
255,Favourite Rybakina 'born' for Wimbledon success,"This video can not be played Rybakina beats Svitolina in straight sets to reach semi-finals In an open women's draw, one player has emerged as the obvious favourite to win Wimbledon. Elena Rybakina, champion in 2022, is the highest-ranked player left in the competition and is playing some of her best tennis since she lifted the title. Take, for example, her quarter-final win against Elina Svitolina. It took just 61 minutes, with Rybakina hitting an impressive 28 winners. The Kazakh world number four will bid for a second Wimbledon final in three years when she faces 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova in the second semi-final on Centre Court on Thursday. ""This is something I want to achieve, I want to do again,"" said Rybakina. ""Everybody wants to win. Everybody's going to fight."" Rybakina arrived at Wimbledon with limited grass-court preparation, having retired from her second-round match at the Berlin Open with abdominal pain and then withdrawing from Eastbourne. But she has been in formidable form, dropping just one set - against Laura Siegemund in the second round - and extending her impressive SW19 record to 19 wins from 21 matches. Her win percentage of 90.5 is bettered only by Ann Jones and Steffi Graf in the Wimbledon women's singles in the Open era. ""I think that's an amazing statistic,"" Rybakina told BBC Sport. ""When I first played on grass I didn't feel comfortable, but my coach told me 'you were born for this, you just need to keep going'.'"" He proved correct, with Rybakina clinching the title on just her second main-draw appearance. She has moved through the gears this year in a draw that saw rival Aryna Sabalenka withdraw before her first match and top two seeds Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff lose in the third and fourth rounds respectively. So who - if anyone - can stop Rybakina this year?

However, the pair have yet to meet on a grass court. The Czech began the season as the world number 10, but she has slipped down the rankings since after being hampered by illness and a back injury. Krejcikova is the only other Grand Slam singles champion left in the draw, but she has not played in a major semi-final since her French Open triumph in 2021. Rybakina will also know that Krejcikova has produced numerous shocks this fortnight, upsetting 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and in-form Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals.

Italian Paolini is a late bloomer. She had never reached the second week of a Grand Slam until six weeks ago when she stormed to the French Open final. Incredibly, she had not won a main draw match at Wimbledon until this summer's tournament. She beat world number 12 Madison Keys in the fourth round before taking just 58 minutes to dismantle 19th seed Emma Navarro in the quarter-finals. Her opponent Vekic is also appearing in a first Wimbledon semi-final. Just a month ago, the 28-year-old Croat was on the verge of quitting tennis, having struggled with a run of injuries. Now she is on the best Grand Slam run of her career, having beaten qualifier Lulu Sun to reach a first major semi-final.

Skupski won last year's tournament alongside Dutchman Wesley Koolhof but is now partnering New Zealander Michael Venus. Patten is paired with Finland's Harri Heliovaara, with the British duo set to meet in the second match on Court One.

256,Vingegaard outsprints Pogacar to win epic Tour stage,"Both Vingegaard (left) and Pogacar are looking for their third Tour de France win overall Denmark's Jonas Vingegaard won stage 11 of the Tour de France following a sprint to the line with rival and overall leader Tadej Pogacar. Defending champion Vingegaard, of Visma-Lease a Bike, edged out Pogacar of UAE-Team-Emirates as the pair raced for the line after several climbs on the 211km stage to Le Lioran in France's Massif Central region. Pogacar remains in the yellow jersey and is now one minute six seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, who was third on the stage, with Vingegaard a further eight seconds behind. When Slovenian Pogacar attacked with 32km to go he pulled away from the rest of the field but Vingegaard reeled him back in on the penultimate climb. Denmark's Vingegaard, 27, suffered a major crash in early April which left him with multiple serious injuries and he said through tears after the stage: ""It is very emotional for me, coming back from the crash... ""It means a lot and all the things I went through in the last three months... I would never have been able to do this without my family."" On Monday's rest day Pogacar had suggested that Vingegaard was ""a little afraid"" of him and his team, following Sunday's stage nine in which Vingegaard chose only to follow Pogacar's wheel. But Vingegaard was the first to launch the sprint on Tuesday as they accelerated to the line, and stayed ahead of the straining Pogacar, 25. ""Now we can all see it's a fair fight and [Vingegaard] is in top shape,"" said Pogacar afterwards.  ""He beat me really good on the line. Let's continue to do it like this.""

260,Atkinson makes speedy claim to be England's future,"This video can not be played Atkinson takes seven wickets on Test debut Life comes at you fast and Gus Atkinson bowls faster. For all of the attention and emotion generated by James Anderson’s final appearance in Test cricket, it was Atkinson who eased into the slipstream and hinted at England’s tomorrow. How perfect it would have been had Anderson presented Atkinson with his cap on a moody Wednesday morning at Lord’s – that honour went to debuting wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, with Atkinson welcomed to the England fold by Surrey team-mate Ollie Pope. Instead, Atkinson had to settle for taking over from Anderson, literally replacing him in the attack 10 overs into the first morning of the first Test against West Indies, and responded with the best figures by an England bowler on debut for 29 years.  His name was on the famous honours board before the day was out. “I walked in after and the board is right where I’m sitting, so it’s very special to see it up there,” Atkinson told BBC Sport. “I’m very proud. I don’t think it’s really sunk in yet.” On an occasion all about Anderson, the stars (and dark clouds) had aligned to present what seemed the perfect conditions to end a legendary career with one final mesmeric spell. Atkinson makes speedy claim to be England's future Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS Podcast: Atkinson stars as Anderson begins farewell Seldom do home crowds cheer quite so loudly when England win the toss and choose to field, but the Lord’s spectators recognised the grey sky and floodlights were prime Jimmy material. There was a moving tribute video played on the big screen to England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, he led his team out for the national anthems and the entire Anderson family were on hand to ring the five-minute bell. But this stage would not be filled by a greatest hits set, rather a thrilling debut album, one that will be music to the ears of the England hierarchy following the decision to pull Anderson from the dancefloor. Not for one second is anyone trying to claim Atkinson is a better bowler than Anderson now, or that he will be in the future. England, though, have nailed their colours to pace, consistently telling us that Test bowlers are most likely to be successful when they get up above 85mph. And, for all of the encouragement offered to Anderson and Chris Woakes in the early going, West Indies openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis were relatively untroubled by bowling in the low 80s. This video can not be played Vaughan analyses Atkinson's fine first-innings performance That all changed when Atkinson pushed down the slope at the Pavilion End in the 11th over. Quick steps, short delivery stride, high arm. His first delivery hit 89mph and his second, at 88mph, drew the usually obdurate Brathwaite into a wild hack and a drag-on to the stumps. “I just wanted to get it down there in a good area. It wasn’t exactly where I wanted to bowl it, but it came off well, so I can’t complain,” said Atkinson. “It was a bit of relief and nice to get the first one out of the way quickly.” Atkinson’s average speed of 87.86 in that opening over is the second-fastest by an England bowler since such data has been measured, bettered only by Steven Finn in Bangladesh in 2010. Slippery and skiddy, Atkinson made light of the slow pitch with a full length and a scrambled seam. In his third over, he added the wicket of Kirk McKenzie, drawn into an edge to second slip. Overall, his opening spell of five overs contained four maidens and the two runs he did concede were from a misfield. Tellingly it was Atkinson, rather than Anderson, who was asked to begin proceedings after lunch, a decision repaid with a spectacular triple-wicket maiden. Alick Athanaze poked to first slip and a squared-up Jason Holder was held at third for a golden duck. Joshua da Silva prevented Atkinson becoming only the fourth man to take a hat-trick on Test debut, but next ball inside-edged to give Smith his first catch as a Test keeper. By this point, Atkinson had become the fifth England debutant to take a five-wicket haul in the two years Ben Stokes has been captain, following just two in the 13 previous years. After Alzarri Joseph chipped to mid-on and Shamar Joseph got in an ugly tangle to be caught at backward point, Atkinson finished with 7-45, the best figures by an England bowler on Test bow since Dominic Cork on the same ground against the same opponents in 1995. When Anderson trapped last man Jayden Seales lbw to leave West Indies 121 all out, the crowd sang Jimmy’s name, but it was Atkinson who led England from the field. Those who know Atkinson say he is quiet, to the point of being shy. After he showed his well-earned match ball to the crowd as they applauded him off, he dropped it. His father Ed was in the Lord’s Long Room, just as he was in the team huddle for the cap presentation at the beginning of the day, alongside Atkinson’s brother, sister and aunt. His mother Caroline passed away after a car crash four years ago. “He’s a big cricket fan, to make him proud and my family proud is very special,” said Atkinson. “Walking through the Long Room at the end and seeing him there was pretty cool.” At 26, Atkinson is something of a late developer. He did not make his Surrey debut until the age of 22 and this is his first first-class match at Lord’s. “Gus Atkinson looks the real deal,” said former England captain Michael Vaughan. “He bowled with good zip and pace at the first time of asking. “We know England are looking for pace. If you want to win a five-match series against India or Australia, you're probably going to need five quicks that you can rotate. “The hope for England by next summer is that they've got a group of bowlers that you don't know who you're going to leave out.” Life comes at you fast. Very soon Anderson will be England’s past. Atkinson has made a speedy claim to be a big part of their future.

261,England to face Spain in Euro 2024 final - what to expect,"This video can not be played Watkins score late goal for England England will face Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final in Berlin after beating the Netherlands 2-1 in the semi-final. The game, with a 20:00 BST kick-off, will be shown live on BBC One and the iPlayer, with commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. ITV will also show the final. The Three Lions are hoping to go one step further than at Euro 2020 when they lost the final on penalties to Italy. But in their way are the best team at Euro 2024 so far, three-time champions Spain. This will be England's third match against Spain at a European Championship - and the Three Lions triumphed in the previous two. In the 1980 group stages, England beat Spain 2-1 in Naples - although both sides went out. And in 1996 the sides met in the last 16 at Wembley, with England winning on penalties after a goalless draw. Their only other meeting at a major tournament was the 1950 World Cup, with Spain winning 1-0 in a group game in Rio de Janeiro. England did win the most recent tie, a 3-2 victory in Seville in the 2018 Nations League, but only won two of their 10 meetings before that (excluding penalties). In international and club finals, though, Spanish teams take some stopping - with 22 successes in a row since 2001. The national team have won their past three major tournament finals, while the last nine Champions League finals and 10 Europa League finals involving a Spanish side and a foreign team have all ended in La Liga victory. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 France While England were perceived to be in the 'easy half' of the Euro 2024 draw, Spain's route to the final could not have been more difficult. In the group stage, they beat 2018 World Cup semi-finalists Croatia and defending European champions Italy. Then in the quarter-finals they beat hosts Germany - who were arguably the second-best team in the Euros - and in the semi-finals eliminated 2018 world champions France. Not only that but they have won all six games without the need for penalties. No team have managed that in one European Championship before. They are also the top scorers in the tournament with 13 goals. Spain also have history in the Euros, winning it in 1964, 2008 and 2012. They are bidding to become the first nation to win it four times. This video can not be played 'The next superstar' - pundits praise Yamal If Spain win, this tournament is likely to go down in history as the introduction of Lamine Yamal - in the way Pele took the 1958 World Cup by storm. The 16-year-old Barcelona player became the youngest European Championship player ever when he started their opening game against Croatia. In the semi-final his stunning effort into the top scorer made him the youngest goalscorer at a Euros or World Cup, breaking Pele's record. He also broke Pele's record of the youngest player in a semi-final in either tournament. Not only has he been playing - and scored one of the goals of the tournament - but statistically he has generally been one of the best players too, with three assists and 13 chances created. Yamal plays on the right wing and on the left has been one of the tournament's other stars, Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams, who is only 21 himself. The pair, who have become close friends, celebrate birthdays in the two days leading up to the final. Luis de la Fuente's side also have the current leader in the Golden Boot race: Leipzig midfielder Dani Olmo. Despite only starting two games he has scored three goals - level with four other players - but his two assists are the tie-breaker.  Another contender for the player of the tournament is Spain's Manchester City defensive midfielder Rodri. The 28-year-old, who was born on the day England knocked Spain out of Euro '96, has only lost one of his past 79 games for club and country.

273,From living on the street to advising Prince William,"Sabrina Cohen-Hatton has gone from rough sleeping as a teenager to visiting the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle to give him advice on tackling homelessness. She was able to give her own story to Prince William as proof that homeless people should not be ""written off"". ""I sit in front of you now with a job, a home, a family and a PhD,"" said Sabrina, who works as a fire service chief. Prince William marked the first year of his Homewards project with a visit to Lambeth in south London where he pleged: ""It is possible to end homelessness."" The prince delivered the message that there is nothing inevitable about homelessness and that it shouldn't be normalised. Meeting Homewards representatives in Brixton he said: “Homelessness is a complex societal issue, and one that touches the lives of far too many people in our society. However, I truly believe that it can be ended."" He spoke of the importance of ""shifting perspectives"" about homeless people and the need to ""focus on prevention, rather than simply managing the crisis"". Homewards is a five-year project based around six areas around the UK. That includes Newport in South Wales - and as a 15- and 16-year-old that was where Sabrina was sleeping rough, after the death of a parent and problems at home. Her way out was selling the Big Issue - ""I credit them with saving my life"" - and once she had secure accommodation she was able to get a job in the fire service, which became her career. She used this ""lived experience""  to tell Prince William and the Homewards project about what was needed. ""There were lots of closed doors in my face,"" she said. Even when support was meant to be available, she said in practice it could be hard for homeless people to have the confidence to access it. Or there can be practical barriers. She said she relied on her dog, called Menace, but many hostels wouldn't let people stay with pets. Sabrina also warned of how homelessness was linked to the ""pernicious"" long-term impact of poverty. She went on to become chief fire officer of West Sussex and has spoken widely about her own journey, including this latest role as an advocate for Homewards. Sabrina said Prince William showed a lot of ""empathy"" towards the issue of homelessness, which she suggested reflected some of the ""trauma"" in his early life. At the event in Brixton, Sabrina spoke alongside Chris Lynam, who recalled the intense ""loneliness"" that accompanied his own homelessness and drug addiction. ""It's a very isolating experience... society is quite hostile to homeless people,"" said Chris, who is now supporting Homewards' work in Sheffield. Prince William described it as an ""honour"" to hear Chris talk about his experiences. The homelessness project, operating in Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Lambeth, Newport, Sheffield and Northern Ireland, wants to find successful approaches that can be replicated elsewhere. There are links with employers about helping people into work. A partnership with Homebase provides starter packs of furniture to help those moving from homelessness into accommodation. There are efforts to identify sofa-surfing and addressing links between relationship breakdown and homelessness. Putting housing officers in schools has been tried to identify young people who might be at risk. Through the Duchy of Cornwall there are 24 homes being built with ""wrap-around support"" for people leaving homelessness - and Prince William is now involved in developing further plans. There is a push to change attitudes towards homelessness - and Sabrina talked about the need to get rid of the stigma. She said that for 20 years she hadn't told anyone about her own experiences, before becoming such a public speaker about homelessness. Matt Downie, chief executive of Crisis, says the Homewards project can challenge the ""cynicism and fatalism"" that says homelessness is inevitable. He says that even though the big picture has seen homelessness getting worse, the evidence exists to prevent it. Finland is given as an example of a sustained drive to end homelessness, with the claim that there are now only about 150 homeless families. In contrast in the UK, there are more than 100,000 households categorised as homeless. There have also been questions about whether a wealthy royal should be pronouncing on homelessness. The anti-monarchy group Republic has previously described it as ""crass and hypocritical"". But George Anderson, a Big Issue seller and medical researcher in London, welcomes that Prince William has used his high public profile to talk about homelessness. ""He encourages people who are distant from homelessness to feel empathy and care,"" says George. ""Given the pomp and ceremony around his official role, it is easy for people to question as to what he really knows about homelessness,"" says George. ""I am sure that he is aware of that whilst also knowing he is in a position, like his mother, to highlight the plight of homelessness to the media. ""His mother would have experienced similar, being photographed in a tiara at a ball one day, whilst serving soup in a homeless kitchen the next,"" says George, who sees the prince's interest as being linked to Princess Diana bringing her sons to homelessness charities when they were children.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1weg5en21wo,"Sean Coughlan,",2024-07-11 13:11:15,
272,'Miracle baby' survives days alone on a roadside,"A days-long search for a missing baby boy in Louisiana has ended after a truck driver spotted the one-year-old crawling through the grass alongside a busy highway.  Sheriff Gary Guillory told the BBC that the child's discovery ""was a miracle"", after he survived alone outdoors for ""two days with no water and no food"".  Calcasieu police had been searching for the baby since 8 July, the day they found his four-year-old brother deceased in a nearby pond.  The same day, a press release sent out by police caused a local media storm that led to the arrest of Aaliyah Jack, the boys' mother, in Mississippi, hundreds of miles away. Ms Jack is in jail in Meridian, Mississippi, awaiting extradition to Louisiana on a charge of failing to report a missing child.  Mr Guillory said that additional charges may be added. The baby was taken to hospital and released on Wednesday to child protective services.  ""We call him a miracle baby,"" Sheriff Guillory said. ""He did have insect bites all over his body, but he was in good spirits. We're just thankful."" The sheriff said the weather worked in their favour.  ""The sun never really came out and heated up the air,"" he said, referring to Louisiana's often brutal summer temperatures.  ""We had some remnants from [Hurricane] Beryl, some extra cloud coverage that probably kept his body cool. We were very lucky.""  The sequence of events leading to the baby's rescue began on Monday when the Calcasieu Parish Sherrifs Office received a call about a body being located in a pond near the Vinton Welcome Center. ""Our first priority was to get it out to the news media and get some leads,"" Mr Guillory said.  ""And that's exactly what happened.""  On Monday evening, the sheriff's office received a call from a grandmother who had seen the reports and was concerned about her grandchildren. She told police the four-year-old had a younger brother, which caused police to issue a 'bolo' (be on the lookout) alert for the missing one-year-old and his mother. Ms Jackson was arrested at a train station in Mississippi hours later. On Tuesday morning, a marine division of the sheriff's office was boating through the pond where the brother had been found, searching for the missing boy.  They then received a call around 09:00 EST (14:00 BST) from a truck driver along Interstate-10 near the Texas-Louisiana border who said he had seen a baby ""crawling"" through a nearby ditch.  Mr Guillory said the investigation is ongoing and the cause of death for the four-year-old is currently unknown. An autopsy report is pending.

271,The Shining actress Shelley Duvall dies at 75,"US actress Shelley Duvall, known for films like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville, has died at the age of 75. Her partner Dan Gilroy confirmed the news to The Hollywood Reporter.  ""My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,"" he said, according to the outlet. She died in her sleep of complications from diabetes at her home in Texas, Gilroy said. Duvall's other credits included 1977 drama 3 Women, directed by Robert Altman, for which she won the Cannes Film Festival's best actress award and was nominated for a Bafta. Three years later, she starred as Olive Oyl opposite Robin Williams in Altman's musical version of Popeye. But Duvall fell out of favour in Hollywood and was off screens for two decades, before making her comeback in 2023's The Forest Hills. With her large brown eyes and offbeat charisma, Duvall was a distinctive and compelling presence. She began her career, and her association with Altman, in 1970 dark comedy Brewster McCloud, and the pair reunited for McCabe and Mrs Miller in 1971.  After filming her performance as a woman who falls for a 1930s bank robber in their next movie, Thieves Like Us, Altman told her: ""I knew you were good, but I didn't know you were great."" She said that remark was ""the reason I stuck with it and became an actress"". The director stuck with her, once saying she ""was able to swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic, even beautiful"". Altman cast her again in 1975's Nashville, his satire of US society, politics and country music. Their next collaboration, 3 Women, saw Duvall play a talkative, trend-following health spa attendant. The Guardian's Anne Billson ranked it as her best role, and ""quite simply one of the greatest performances of the 1970s"". Meanwhile, also in 1977, Duvall memorably played Pam, a Rolling Stone reporter who went on a date with Woody Allen's Alvy in Annie Hall. Her best-known role was perhaps Wendy, the wife of Jack Nicholson's terrifying hotel caretaker in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror classic The Shining. Filming was an ordeal. ""I had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week,"" she once recalled. After that, Duvall's film roles included Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits and Roxanne with Steve Martin. She also set up her own production companies, and made and hosted beloved 1980s children's TV show Faerie Tale Theatre. Her acting roles diminished in the 1990s, with Jane Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady the pick of the crop, and she dropped off the radar in 2002. The New York Times attributed her apparent disappearance to the impact of a 1994 earthquake that damaged her Los Angeles home, and the stress of her brother having cancer. Discussing her prolonged absence from the screen, she told the paper in May she had been the victim of a fickle film industry. ""I was a star. I had leading roles. People think it's just ageing, but it's not. It's violence,"" she said. Asked to explain, she said: ""How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime they turn on you? ""You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true."" Concerns about her health were raised when she appeared on the TV talk show Dr Phil in 2016 and told him: ""I'm very sick. I need help."" She also talked about receiving messages from a ""shapeshifting"" Robin Williams following his death, and talked about malevolent forces who were out to do her harm, the paper said. Speaking about that period, Gilroy told the New York Times she had become ""paranoid and just kind of delusional"". Asked by the paper why she had agreed to return to the screen in The Forest Hills, she replied: ""I wanted to act again. And then this guy kept calling, and so I wound up doing it."" Novelist Nicole Flattery wrote in the Financial Times in 2023 that her return showed her magic had remained intact. In an article dubbing her the ""ultimate film star"", Flattery summed up her talent, writing: ""She’s a master at playing characters who act happy when they’re sad, their daffiness masking depth.""

270,Whole pod of 77 whales die in 'biggest mass stranding in decades',"A pod of 77 pilot whales has died after washing ashore on a beach in Orkney in what could be the biggest mass stranding for decades. The British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) had established 12 of the animals at Tresness Beach on the island of Sanday were still alive when they came out of the water. However the decision was taken to euthanise them after refloating efforts failed. The pod included male whales up to seven metres (22ft) long as well as females, calves and juveniles. Experts say it is too early to know what has caused the stranding, but it is likely one of the whales got into trouble and the rest of the pod tried to help. Members of the public are being asked to stay away from the area post mortem examinations are carried out. It is thought to be the largest stranding event in Scotland since at least 1995, when the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) was founded - though strandings of a similar scale have been seen in recent years. Last year an entire pod of 55 pilot whales died following a stranding on Lewis. Only 15 of whales were alive when they were washed ashore. One was successfully re-floated while the rest had to be euthanised. Between 60-70 of the animals came into shallow waters in Sutherland in 2011. According to the Natural History Museum, the largest UK stranding took place in 1927 when 126 out of more than 130 false killer whales died in the Dornoch Firth in the Highlands. Experts from the BDMLR, the Scottish SPCA and marine vets from the Scottish mainland travelled to Sanday to assess whether any of the whales could be saved. The area was cut off by the high tide and the sand on the beach where they were stranded proved too soft to allow the mammals to be righted.  The whales needed to be moved back into an upright position as quickly as possible if there is to be any chance of saving them. But the soft sand meant the whales fell back over when the rescuers attempted to right them. Emma Neave-Webb from the BDMLR said early on that while these experiences are difficult, the thinking had to be ""realistic"". BDMLR medics were brought in from mainland Orkney and Inverness to help with the rescue attempt, but Ms Neave-Webb said it appeared they whales had been stranded for ""quite some time"". She described the scene as ""really quite horrible"" and ""hugely emotional"". Rescuers attempted to keep the whales alive by pouring sea water over them, but the decision was later taken to euthanise them. A spokesperson for Orkney Islands Council said discussions were taking place with community representatives on how best to dispose of the bodies. They said: ""In previous circumstances where whales have beached on our shores and subsequently died, the approach from our Environmental Health team around disposing of the body has been to allow nature to take its course - with the public advised to stay away from the area. ""Our assessment in this case, given the scale and the likely public health implications, is that more definite action will need to be taken, for example burying them where they are or removing the bodies to a large grave site elsewhere."" Andrew Brownlow of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme said mass strandings of this scale are becoming more common in Scotland. He told BBC News: ""It used to be quite unusual to have a mass stranding event, certainly of this  size.  ""But over the last ten years or so we have seen an increase both in the number of mass stranding events around Scotland and also the size of the mass and the number of animals that it involves.  ""So that is slightly concerning and that might be because there are just more animals out there, or it could be that there are more hazards that these animals are exposed to.”",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6xzrxy35o,"Megan Bonar & Rob Flett,",2024-07-11 17:11:15,
268,Israeli army 'failed in mission' to protect kibbutz from Hamas attack,"Israel's defence minister has called for a state inquiry into what led to the Hamas attacks on 7 October, as the military admitted it failed in its duty to protect a small community were 101 people were killed. Yoav Gallant made his comments after the first in a series of official Israeli military reports laid bare how the army operated in Kibbutz Be’eri, which is near the Gaza perimeter fence. More residents died at the kibbutz than any other Israeli community on 7 October, after gunmen crossed from Gaza and rampaged through their homes. Mr Gallant said an independent national inquiry was needed to examine the actions of all those in power, including Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, in relation to how Hamas had grown in strength and capability over the past decade. Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages in the unprecedented assault last autumn.  It led to the major Israeli military operation in Gaza which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Members of the kibbutz said it was important the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admitted it had failed to protect them and they too are demanding a national inquiry. The report, carried out by a senior military officer, commended the bravery of security personal but said the IDF was not prepared for the extensive infiltration by Hamas and “for the first seven hours of combat, the kibbutz residents defended themselves”. It said: “The inquiry team determined that the IDF failed in its mission to protect the residents of Kibbutz Be'eri.” Other findings included: The report also focused on the command given to a tank to shell a house in which 13 hostages were being held. No personal blame was attributed to Brigadier General Barak Hiram, commander of the 99th Infantry Division who was found to have acted professionally along with other senior officers in “complex and difficult circumstances.” The report said: “The tank fire towards the area near the house was carried out professionally, with a joint decision made by commanders from all the security organisations after careful consideration and a situational assessment was made, with the intent to apply pressure to the terrorists and save the civilians held hostage inside.” Brig-Gen Hiram is soon due to take command of the Gaza Division. The report’s authors concluded that as far as they could assess, no civilians inside the house were harmed by tank-shell fire, except for what they called “an isolated incident outside the building where two civilians were injured by shrapnel”. It said: “The team determined that most of the hostages were likely murdered by the terrorists, and further inquiries and reviews of additional findings are necessary.” The IDF’s Chief of the General Staff accepted all the conclusions of the report and ordered they be integrated into future operational plans. Hamas killed one in 10 of the 1,000 residents of Be’eri on 7 October in a rampage that started after dawn and lasted for hours. Sharon Sharabi, whose two brothers Yossi and Eli were taken into Gaza as hostages, was briefed earlier on the report and said he had learned nothing new from the official findings. “There was a command failure here. This is a difficult and bad picture,” he said. Yossi, 53, has been declared dead [by Israeli authorities] and the fate of Eli, who would now be 52, is unknown. Mr Sharabi said: “It cannot be beautified in any way. No investigation they may try to do can make it rosy. It’s impossible.” A statement issued by Kibbutz Be’eri residents said it was of great importance to them that the IDF had asked for their forgiveness for not protecting them from what they called “an unparalleled attack of evil”. “The failure of the army has been burned into our bodies and in our hearts for nine months,” their statement said. Residents said they still had not received satisfactory answers to why the army did not enter the kibbutz, nor had any explanation been given yet for the intelligence failure that allowed Hamas to launch their mass assault undetected. They also called for a national [state] inquiry, which prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been unwilling to initiate. Thursday’s report is expected to be the first in a series of IDF probes into how the 7 October attacks were dealt with in various parts of southern Israel where Hamas attacked.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9x8wjxgz1ko,"Nick Beake,",2024-07-11 19:11:15,
269,Biden introduces Zelensky as Putin before high-stakes news conference,"Gary O'DonoghueSenior North America correspondent Joe Biden is set to field questions from reporters about his fitness to run for president again, as more Democrats join calls for him to step aside.  The news conference at the end of the Nato summit in Washington tonight will be the president's most unscripted appearance since the debate with Donald Trump last month, in which he appeared to lose his train of thought several times.  In many ways, the White House has set the president an impossible task - a press conference on which everything now seems to ride. It's his first in eight months - and few would argue that Biden was a gaffe-free performer even at the height of his powers.  The problem he faces is that so much has already been said that it would require a performance of gargantuan proportion to turn around this seemingly inexorable narrative. But Biden is hoping he has managed to shore up support domestically and quieted dissent within his own party, after sending his advisers to meet Democratic senators ahead of the event. The loyalists - an ever-diminishing number - continue to argue the party is best placed to stick with Biden as their nominee.  That optimism feels like clutching at straws, however. Political leadership can evaporate in a moment, and Joe Biden is just having too many of those moments right now.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2v0nzx16gzt,Unknown,Unknown,
266,India tycoon’s son to marry after months of festivities,"After months of lavish celebrations spread across the world, the wedding ceremony of the son of Asia's richest man is set to take place on Friday. Anant Ambani, son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, will tie the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant. The four-day wedding extravaganza in Mumbai city is the final stop in a string of lavish parties the family has hosted since March.  The events, which have already featured performances by popstars like Rihanna and Justin Bieber, have captured the world's attention.  But it has also led to backlash - city dwellers have complained of traffic snarls, while others have questioned the ostentatious display of wealth at the seemingly never-ending celebrations.  Mukesh Ambani, 66, is at present the world's 10th richest man with a net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes. Reliance Industries, founded by his father in 1966, is a massive conglomerate that operates in sectors ranging from petroleum and retail, to financial services and telecoms. Anant Ambani is the youngest of his three children, all of whom are on the board of Reliance Industries. The 29-year-old is involved in Reliance's energy businesses and is on the board of Reliance Foundation. On Friday, the couple will get married in a traditional Hindu ceremony at the Jio World Convention Centre.  Reports say the family will host a grand reception through the weekend, before a final reception for their household staff on Monday. Rumours on the internet suggest that Adele could be performing at the wedding, but the family has not confirmed this.  Mumbai police have labelled the wedding a ""public event"" since it would be attended by several international and Indian VIPs, reports Reuters news agency. The city police has also imposed traffic restrictions around the venue.  From Friday to Monday, roads around the convention centre will be open only for ""event vehicles"" between 13:00 India time (07:30 GMT) to midnight, it said.  Rajan Mehra, CEO of air charter company Club One Air, told Reuters that the family had rented three Falcon-2000 jets to ferry wedding guests to the event. “The guests are coming from all over and each aircraft will make multiple trips across the country,” he said.  The restrictions have sparked anger among the city residents who say they are already struggling with traffic jams and monsoon flooding. The wedding festivities began in March when the family held a three-day pre-wedding party in their home state of Gujarat. Among the 1,200 guests to attend the celebration were international celebrities, politicians, and members of the business world - including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates.  The party started with a performance by Rihanna on the first night. Diljit Dosanjh, the first Punjabi singer to perform at Coachella, took the stage on the second night, while rapper Akon closed the show on the final day of celebrations.  In June, the Ambanis organised another pre-wedding celebration, this time, a luxury cruise from Italy to France. The Backstreet Boys, Katy Perry and Pitbull performed for the 800 guests, which included Bollywood stars and cricketers. Then came the final round of celebrations, which began earlier this week when Bieber landed in Mumbai.  Social media has been flooded with photos and videos of him singing in front of an ecstatic audience. Money was also lavished on constructing 14 temples inside a sprawling complex in Jamnagar to showcase India's cultural heritage and provide a backdrop for the wedding. As part of the celebrations, the Ambanis hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples too. On Wednesday, the family hosted a bhandara - a community feast for underprivileged people. The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them but wedding planners estimate they've already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m]. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Bieber is $10m.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x22w0xl0o,Unknown,2024-07-11 21:11:15,
265,Which Democrats are calling for Joe Biden to step aside?,"A growing number of Democrats are calling on Joe Biden to end his presidential re-election bid and step aside for a younger contender. Concerns over his poor debate performance have spread over the past fortnight among politicians, donors and others within the party. The 81-year-old has defiantly declared he is ""not going anywhere"". But the pressure is mounting as he continues to lose ground in the polls against Republican rival Donald Trump. It began five days after the June 27 debate with Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, who said that it was time for Mr Biden to ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw"". Mr Doggett, 77, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said he respected ""all that President Biden has achieved"" but that the Democrat had failed to ""effectively defend his many accomplishments"" on the debate stage. He has since been joined by other House of Representatives colleagues: It took just under two weeks from the debate for the first Democrat senator to call for Mr Biden to drop out. Peter Welch, of Vermont, told the Washington Post: ""We need him to put us first, as he has done before,"" he said. ""I urge him to do it now."" Other prominent figures have also joined the growing chorus: Senior Democrats, including party leaders in Washington, have held their fire and straddled the fence on whether Mr Biden should continue his 2024 bid. Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, declined to directly answer whether she wanted him to keep running. She did so on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the president's favourite news programme.  ""I want him to do whatever he decides to do,"" she said, adding that ""time is running short"" for him to make that call. Her replacement as House Democratic chief, Hakeem Jeffries, has said he is having ""candid, comprehensive and clear-eyed"" conversations with his members and that he will meet his leadership team to discuss next steps. But he rejected suggestions that Mr Biden had become a political liability for House Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has publicly said he is ""for Joe"" but, per Axios, is privately signalling to donors that he is open to replacing Mr Biden. Many politicians have carefully parsed their words, expressing respect for the president's accomplishments in office while noting that his poor polling and  concerning public appearances raise significant questions. Montana's Jon Tester and Ohio's Sherrod Brown are two of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election. While Mr Brown has largely dodged questions on the topic, Mr Tester says Mr Biden ""has got to prove"" that he is up to the job. Colleagues have echoed those concerns. Patty Murray, of Washington state, said Mr Biden ""must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump"". Michael Bennet, of Colorado, warned that Mr Trump was on track to win ""by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House"". Two high-profile House members, California's Adam Schiff and Maryland's Jamie Raskin, as well as Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, have also publicly aired their doubts since the 27 June debate. But the president is not without his backers. Vice-President Kamala Harris has not wavered in standing by her boss, as have potential replacement candidates such as Gavin Newsom, California's governor, and his Michigan and Maryland contemporaries Gretchen Whitmer and Wes Moore. The powerful Congressional Black Caucus, which represents about one quarter of House Democrats, reaffirmed its backing for Mr Biden this week. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has done the same, though some of its members are reportedly not on board. Also standing by Mr Biden, and enthusiastically so, are outspoken figures on the Hill such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York congresswoman, two-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania senator.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngd0dve6lo,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-11 19:11:15,
264,'Relief' as Canadian serial killer found guilty in death of 4 women,"Tearful cheers erupted in a packed Canadian courtroom on Thursday as a judge found a serial killer guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of four indigenous women.  But in the court gallery, Jeremy Contois' reaction was reserved. His younger sister, Rebecca, was one of the women killed in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba two years ago. “I feel a little sense of relief,” Mr Contois said, but will not get full closure until the killer, Jeremy Skibicki, is formally sentenced. In his oral verdict, Manitoba Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal dismissed the argument by the defence at trial that the accused was not criminally responsible for the murders.  Lawyers for Skibicki, 37, said he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the killings. Prosecutors argued that Skibicki deliberately killed Ms Contois and three other women in 2022 in crimes that were calculated and racially motivated. Warning: This story contains details readers may find distressing. The murders and the subsequent weeks-long trial sent shockwaves through Canada’s indigenous community, which has long grappled with cases of violence against their women. Wearing a grey T-shirt and pants, Skibicki did not react as Judge Joyal read aloud the summary of his judgment. One of Ms Contois’ family members held up a large photo of Rebecca in his direction as he left the courtroom.  “Why did I lift up her photo? Because we, as First Nations people, are not statistics,” Krista Fox said afterwards. “Every single one of us has a name, and a family that misses us dearly.” Skibicki's victims are Morgan Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26 and Ms Contois, who was 24. The fourth woman has yet to be identified, and has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman, by indigenous elders. Throughout the trial, a buffalo head sat on a red cloth on a table near the prosecutors in tribute to the still unidentified victim.  In his verdict, Judge Joyal said the accused failed to demonstrate he was not criminally responsible for the murders, dismissing the testimony of a British psychiatrist, Dr Sohom Das, who said Skibicki was motivated by delusions when he committed the murders. The judge added that the ""mercilessly graphic"" facts of the case ""are largely uncontested"", given that the accused had admitted to the murders in police interviews and in court prior to the trial.  Skibicki had pleaded not guilty due to a mental disorder. The 100-person courtroom was packed full with the four women's families and friends for the verdict. Judge Joyal said the case has had an ""undeniable and profound impact on the entire Manitoba community, indigenous and non-indigenous"". With Skibicki facing life behind bars, the focus is now shifting to finding the remains of two of his victims, Ms Myran and Ms Harris, which are believed to be in a Winnipeg landfill. A formal search has been set for this autumn, after months of pressure from their families.  According to court documents, Skibicki killed the women between March and May of 2022, with Ms Contois believed to be the final victim. He met at least two at local homeless shelters in Winnipeg, a city of 820,000 in the prairie province. Judge Joyal agreed with prosecutors that he deliberately targeted and exploited “vulnerable” women. Over the course of the trial, the court heard that Skibicki had assaulted the women, strangled or drowned them and then committed sex acts on them before dismembering their bodies and disposing of them in garbage bins. The killings went undetected for months, until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki’s apartment found partial human remains in May 2022 and called police. “She’s obviously been murdered,” the man said in the 911 call, which was played in court. Police were able to identify the remains as those of Ms Contois. More of her remains were discovered at a city-run landfill the following month. In police interviews shortly after his arrest, Skibicki surprised officers by admitting to killing Ms Contois as well as three others. At that point, police had no knowledge of the other deaths. Speaking outside court, Ms Fox said she believes that it was only because Ms Contois’ remains were found that the other families were able to get justice. Skibicki’s lawyers tried to argue that he was not aware of the severity of his actions due to delusions driven by schizophrenia. They argued he was hearing voices that told him to commit the crimes as part of a mission from god. Prosecutors argued that Skibicki was fully aware of his actions, saying they were “intentional, purposeful and racially motivated”. They demonstrated this through a mix of DNA forensic evidence, surveillance footage showing Skibicki with the women in their final days, as well as testimony from his ex-wife, who detailed a history of physical abuse. Had Skibicki been found not criminally responsible for the four murders, it would have been a relative rarity in Canadian law. According to data from Canada's statistics agency and reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, between 2000 and 2022, of 8,883,749 criminal cases prosecuted across the country, only 5,178 – or 0.06% – had such verdicts. The case unearthed deep wounds for Canada’s indigenous community, which has long grappled with a high number of cases of their women going missing or being murdered. According to an investigation by the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, Winnipeg - a city near numerous indigenous communities - had the highest number of missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada between 2018 and 2022. Across Canada, indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women, according to a 2019 inquiry. Some indigenous women in the city remain missing, sparking fears from family members that Skibicki had more victims. The Crown, however, said they do not believe he murdered more women. Even with the relief of a guilty verdict, Mr Contois, Rebecca’s brother, said he still wonders why his sister - who is also a mother to a young daughter - was so brutally murdered. “Why did he have to do it?” he said. “I wish I knew that.”",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727v3d5v4lo,"Nadine Yousif,",2024-07-11 21:11:15,
263,Texas hospitals filling up as heat and power cuts take toll,"Hospitals in the Houston area are filling up after Hurricane Beryl left more than a million people in the city without electricity during a deadly heat wave. The city's football stadium has been converted into a ""transitional facility"" for when hospitals reach capacity, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said. ""[Hospitals] can't discharge patients because patients can't go home if they don't have power,"" Mr Patrick said at a press conference.  Tens of millions of people were under a heat advisory on Thursday, as searing temperatures scorch the US from California to Texas.  In Texas, a heat advisory has been issued in dozens of cities.  The threat is amplified in the Houston area, where temperatures are expected to reach 105F (40C), and where residents are still recovering from the hurricane. More than two million were without power as powerful winds uprooted trees and stripped powerlines on Monday.  Around 1.3 million people in the state still lack electricity. More than 100 cooling centres in the Houston area have been launched to help residents. There are also reports of long rows of cars idling in lines at filling stations waiting to refuel - becoming the last resort for those without indoor air conditioning. On Wednesday, Mr Patrick called it ""a miserable situation"".  ""It's pitch black at night"" and ""hot as Hades in the day"", he said, adding that people have also lost access to food that would normally be kept cool in a fridge.  Other parts of the US are also grappling with an ongoing heat wave that is expected to last through the weekend, including in typically milder climates like Oregon. Heat advisories have been issued for nine states, including Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Oregon.  In California, officials warned of ""dangerously hot conditions"" forecasting temperatures up to 120F (49C) in places like Palm Springs, lasting until Saturday.  A man in Sacramento died in hospital on Sunday after being brought from his non-air conditioned home, on a day when it was 106F (41C).  Further north, where temperatures are often cooler, similar triple-digit weather is expected in parts of Oregon, officials have warned.  Ten people have died in the state in connection to record-breaking heat, although further investigations are pending to determine exact causes of death.  More then 280 temperature records have been broken in the state this year, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Climate scientists say that average daily temperatures globally have increased, making hotter days more likely and more intense. The cause is often linked to human-led climate change.  Last year the planet reached its hottest recorded day four days in a row, according to data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c29d01j1jkzo,"Brandon Drenon,",2024-07-11 18:11:15,
262,Hungary's Viktor Orbán to meet Donald Trump,"Donald Trump will meet Viktor Orbán in Florida on Thursday night, just weeks after the Hungarian prime minister met Russia's Vladimir Putin.  His visit to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach is the latest in a number of meetings between the two men.  Mr Orbán has publicly endorsed Trump's re-election bid and recently said there was a ""very, very high chance"" that President Joe Biden would lose the election.   The Hungarian leader has been frequently criticised in Europe for his pro-Russian views but remains popular among Trump supporters and US conservatives. He has also recently met China's Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a self-described ""peace"" initiative. On Wednesday, Russian newspaper Izvestia wrote such initiatives were futile, ""but Viktor Orbán may pass information he has collected to Trump's team"".  Mr Orbán told German media earlier this week that the former US president was a ""self-made man"" with a ""different approach to everything"".  A Trump victory in the US election would be ""good for the world politics"", he added.  ""He [Trump] is a man of peace. Under his four-year term he did not initiate a single war, and he did a lot in order to create peace in old conflicts in very complicated areas of the world.""  Mr Orbán, whose country currently holds the presidency of the European Union, also criticised the Biden administration for failing to end the conflict in Ukraine.  “I think new leadership will provide new chances,"" he said. Mr Orbán was the first and only EU leader to back Trump's bid for presidency in 2016, but had to wait until May 2019 for his first visit to the White House. Trump has found more time for the Hungarian leader out of power. At the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, he told cheering delegates: ""The globalists can all go to hell... I have come to Texas."" His creation of a similar group in his country, CPAC Hungary, has boosted his relationships further. In March this year, after meeting Trump in Florida, Mr Orbán posted on X/Twitter: ""We need leaders in the world who are respected and can bring peace. He is one of them! Come back and bring us peace, Mr President."" In April this year, Trump sent a short video message to CPAC Hungary, saying he was ""honoured to address so many patriots in Hungary... proudly fighting on the front lines of the battle to rescue western civilisation.  ""Together we’re engaged in an epic struggle to liberate our nations from all of the sinister forces who want to destroy them.’ He referred to Mr Orbán in the same address as ""a great man"". Mr Orbán has boasted that he has created an ""illiberal democracy"" in Hungary, and claims ""progressives"" have unleashed a ""virus"" of ""migration, gender, and the woke movement"".",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydvj24m4g4o,"Bernd Debusmann Jr & Nick Thorpe,",2024-07-11 20:11:15,
267,Canada to hit Nato spending target by 2032 - Trudeau,"Canada will reach the benchmark that requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military by 2032, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said. Speaking at the Nato summit in Washington DC, Mr Trudeau also hit back at those using a ""crude mathematical calculation"" to criticise an ally that ""continually punches above its weight"". As the military alliance marks its 75th anniversary, pressure has been mounting for members to meet the spending target set out by its doctrine. Canada currently spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military. The Nato founding member places seventh overall among 32 nations in the amount of money it spends on defence. But using the 2% metric, America's northern neighbour is ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the 32-member alliance.  By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%. Frustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators, who urged the country to immediately develop a plan to increase its spending.  Some US lawmakers have more bluntly criticised Canada over its Nato benchmark shortfall.  “They have the safety and security of being on our border and not having to worry about that. I think that’s shameful,"" Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson said this week.  ""I think if you’re going to be a member nation and participant, you need to do your part.”  Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters at the close of the annual summit on Thursday. ""Since 2015, we've added C$175bn in defence spending,"" he said. ""Canada fully expects to reach Nato's 2% of GDP spending target by 2032."" He added that the government has ""built in a regular cycle of review in Canada's defence, including a new defence policy update in 2028"". ""Through that process, we will continue to explore opportunities that will further increase defence spending and advance Canada's strategic interests,"" he said. The Nato alliance finds itself at a critical moment, as member nations grapple with a more aggressive Russia that continues to wage war in Ukraine.  European allies are also concerned about the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency and the dramatic foreign policy shifts that would come with it.",2024-07-11 23:11:15,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0yr36e6l9o,"Sam Cabral,",2024-07-11 18:11:15,
274,Can Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easily,"Knives are out for Joe Biden after his poorly received performance in the first 2024 presidential debate against Donald Trump.  With November's election bearing down, a growing number of Democrats are calling on the president to step aside due to concerns about his mental fitness.  Around a dozen Democrats have publicly broken ranks and called for Mr Biden to step aside to be replaced by someone younger from his party. Mr Biden has defiantly vowed to stay in the race, including during public events and in interviews with ABC News and MSNBC.   Unless he agrees to stand aside, it will get ugly.  Let's run through the scenarios. Yes, if - and it's a big if - Mr Biden decides to step down as the Democratic Party's standard bearer, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are reportedly planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually ahead of that gathering. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of ""delegates"" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election.  This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are ""pledged"" to support the incumbent president.  If Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all.  Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes.  That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination.  Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside.  But if he decides to do so, ""that opens up an entirely different can of worms"", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News.   ""I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,"" she said.   If he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination.  However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out.  The rules allow delegates to ""in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them"", meaning they could look to someone else. ""It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,"" Ms Wright Rigueur said.  Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for re-election. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results.  Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention.  Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. It may be that Mr Biden backs her to replace him if he steps aside. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris would have access to all the campaign funds currently available to the president. And she has a national profile. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage.   The 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows the US vice-president and the majority of the cabinet to declare the president unable to perform the duties of office.  If invoked, power is transferred to the vice-president to serve as acting president.   This has never happened before.  But following the debate, senior congressional Republicans called on Mr Biden's cabinet to consider invoking this clause.  After the US Capitol riot in 2021, the Democratic-controlled House approved a resolution urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump, but the move went nowhere.",2024-07-11 23:11:16,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv821nljwo,"Christal Hayes, Holly Honderich & Rachel Looker,",2024-07-11 22:11:16,
275,Why both businesses and scammers love India's payment system,"Every day, for the last seven years, Arun Kumar has set up his fruit stall on a busy Mumbai street. It's not an easy way to make a living. “Being a street vendor is a challenge. There's the fear of being robbed or, as I am not a licensed vendor, the local body can come and dismantle my store anytime,"" he says. But over the past four years at least one aspect of his work has become easier.  “Prior to Covid everything was in cash. But now everyone pays with UPI. Scan the code and the payment is done within seconds. ""No issues of handling cash, giving change to customers. It has made my life and business smooth,” he says. UPI, or to give it its full name the Unified Payments Interface, was launched in 2016  in a collaboration between India's central bank and the nation's banking industry. It's an app-based instant payment system, which allows users to send and receive money, pay bills and authorise payments in a single step - no need to enter bank details or any other personal information. And, perhaps most importantly, it's free. It has become so popular that India is now the biggest real-time payments market. In May, UPI recorded 14 billion transactions, up from nine billion the year before.  But the popularity and ease of use has made it a rich feeding ground for scammers. “While digital payments are convenient, they do come with vulnerabilities,"" says Shashank Shekhar, founder of the Delhi-based Future Crime Research Foundation. Mr Shekhar says that scammers use a variety of ways to trick people, including persuading them to share their UPI pin number, which is needed to authorise payments. Some scammers have also created fake UPI apps, that are clones of legitimate banking apps, and then steal login details or other valuable information. ""The pace at which digital transformation took place in the country means unfortunately digital literacy and safe internet practice could not catch up,"" says Mr Shekhar. He says that between January 2020 and June 2023 almost half of all financial fraud involved the use of the UPI system. According to government figures there were more than 95,000 cases of fraud involving UPI in the financial year ending April 2023, up from 77,000 in the previous year. Shivkali was one such victim. She had always wanted to own a scooter, but they were beyond her budget. However, earlier in the year the 22-year-old, who lives in Bihar state in northeastern India, spotted one for sale on Facebook that looked like a great deal. ""I grabbed the opportunity without thinking,"" she says.  A couple of clicks later and she was talking to the owner, who said that for $23 he would send over the vehicle papers. That went smoothly, so Shivkali continued to send the owner money, via instant transfers. She eventually ended up paying $200, but the scooter (also commonly called a Scooty in India), was never delivered. Shivkali realised she had been scammed. ""I did not think I could be cheated, as I have some education background and know what is happing in the world. But scammers are smart. They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,” she says. The government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers. But at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank. “The problem is deep rooted,"" says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime. ""Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that’s why the fraudster can’t be traced. ""But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.” But Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame. “It’s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it’s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case. I would say both victim and bank should bear the loss.” Despite those problems, UPI is being promoted in rural areas where access to banking services can be difficult. Poonam Untwal from Rajasthan runs a guidance centre which helps people use the internet and digital banking. ""Most of us are not that educated, nor know the proper use of smartphones. I teach them that phones are no longer a device just to talk to people but banks at their fingertips,"" she says. She believes that UPI will help develop the local economy. ""Many women like me have a small business that we run from our home. Now we can receive and send money with UPI. People who don’t have smart phones come to my centre to get their transactions done,"" she says. As well as making inroads into rural areas, UPI is spreading overseas. Retailers in Bhutan, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and UAE will take UPI payments.  And this year, France become the first European country to accept UPI payments, starting with tickets to the Eiffel Tower. Back in Mumbai, Mr Kumar is happy that he no longer has to use cash, but remains wary. If he can't get a good internet connection then customers can, by accident or design, make off without paying.  ""For a small vendor like me it [UPI] made receiving money very easy. But I am always scared of fraud. I keep hearing in the news how the UPI frauds are increasing. Hopefully some mechanisms are invented so a small vendor like me doesn’t face losses.”",2024-07-11 23:11:16,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c288m1km01po,"Priti Gupta,",2024-07-11 21:11:16,
276,New technology reveals a sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet',"Researchers studying sperm whale communication say they've uncovered sophisticated structures similar to those found in human language. In the inky depths of the midnight zone, an ocean giant bears the scars of the giant squid she stalks. She searches the darkness, her echolocation pulsing through the water column. Then she buzzes – a burst of rapid clicks – just before she goes in for the kill. But exactly how sperm whales catch squid, like many other areas of their lives, remains a mystery. ""They're slow swimmers,"" says Kirsten Young, a marine scientist at the University of Exeter. Squid, on the other hand, are fast. ""How can [sperm whales] catch squid if they can only move at 3 knots [5.5 km/h or 3.5mph]? Are the squid moving really slowly? Or are the whales stunning them with their vocalisations? What happens down there? Nobody really knows,"" she says.    Sperm whales are not easy to study. They spend much of their lives foraging or hunting at depths beyond the reach of sunlight. They are capable of diving over 3km (10,000ft) and can hold their breath for two hours. ""At 1000m (3300ft) deep, many of the group will be facing the same way, flanking each other – but across an area of several kilometres,"" says Young. ""During this time they're talking, clicking the whole time."" After about an hour, she says, the group rises to the surface in synchrony. ""They'll then have their rest phase. They might be at the surface for 15 to 20 minutes. Then they'll dive again,"" she says.    At the end of a day of foraging, says Young, the sperm whales come together at the surface and rub against each other, chatting while they socialise. ""As researchers, we don't see a lot of their behaviour because they don't spend that much time at the surface,"" she says. ""There's masses we don't know about them, because we are just seeing a tiny little snapshot of their lives during that 15 minutes at the surface.""    It was around 47 million years ago that land-roaming cetaceans began to gravitate back towards the ocean – that's 47 million years of evolution in an environment alien to our own. How can we hope to easily understand creatures that have adapted to live and communicate under such different evolutionary pressures to ourselves?      ""It's easier to translate the parts where our world and their world overlap – like eating, nursing or sleeping,"" says David Gruber, lead and founder of the Cetacean Translation Initiative (Ceti) and professor of biology at the City University of New York. ""As mammals, we share these basics with others. But I think it's going to get really interesting when we try to understand the areas of their world where there's no intersection with our own,"" he says. Now, from elephants to dogs, modern technology is helping researchers to sift through enormous datasets, and uncover previously unknown diversity and complexity in animal communication. And Ceti's researchers say they, too, have used AI to decode a ""sperm whale phonetic alphabet"". In 2005, Shane Gero, biology lead for Ceti, founded The Dominica Sperm Whale Project to study the social and vocal behaviour of around 400 sperm whales that live in the Eastern Caribbean. Almost 20 years – and thousands of hours of observation – later, the researchers have discovered intricacies in whale vocalisations never before observed, revealing structures within sperm whale communication akin to human language. Sperm whales live in multi-level, matrilineal societies – groups of daughters, mothers and grandmothers – while the males roam the oceans, visiting the groups to breed. They are known for their complex social behaviour and group decision-making, which requires sophisticated communication. For example, they are able to adapt their behaviour as a group when protecting themselves from predators like orcas or humans.    Sperm whales communicate with each other using rhythmic sequences of clicks, called codas. It was previously thought that sperm whales had just 21 coda types. However, after studying almost 9,000 recordings, the Ceti researchers identified 156 distinct codas. They also noticed the basic building blocks of these codas which they describe as a ""sperm whale phonetic alphabet"" – much like phonemes, the units of sound in human language which combine to form words. (Watch the video below to hear some of the variety in sperm whale vocalisations the AI identified.) Pratyusha Sharma, a PhD student at MIT and lead author of the study, describes the ""fine-grain changes"" in vocalisations the AI identified. Each coda consists of between three and 40 rapid-fire clicks. The sperm whales were found to vary the overall speed, or the ""tempo"", of the codas, as well as to speed up and slow down during the delivery of a coda, in other words, making it ""rubato"". Sometimes they added an extra click at the end of a coda, akin, says Sharma, to ""ornamentation"" in music. These subtle variations, she says, suggest sperm whale vocalisations could carry a much richer amount of information than previously thought.    ""Some of these features are contextual,"" says Sharma. ""In human language, for example, I can say 'what' or 'whaaaat!?'. It's the same word, but to understand the meaning you have to listen to the whole sound,"" she says.    The researchers also found the sperm whale ""phonemes"" could be used in a combinatorial fashion, allowing the whales to construct a vast repertoire of distinct vocalisations. The existence of a combinatorial coding system, write the report authors, is a prerequisite for ""duality of patterning"" – a linguistic phenomenon thought to be unique to human language – in which meaningless elements combine to form meaningful words. However, Sharma emphasises, this is not something they have any evidence of as yet. ""What we show in sperm whales is that the codas themselves are formed by combining from this basic set of features. Then the codas get sequenced together to form coda sequences."" Much like humans combine phonemes to create words, and then words to create sentences.    So, what does all this tell us about sperm whales' intelligence? Or their ability to reason, or store and share information?    ""Well, it doesn't tell us anything yet,"" says Gruber. ""Before we can get to those amazing questions, we need to build a fundamental understanding of how [sperm whales communicate] and what's meaningful to them. We see them living very complicated lives, the coordination and sophistication in their behaviours.  We're at base camp. This is a new place for humans to be – just give us a few years. Artificial intelligence is allowing us to see deeper into whale communication than we've ever seen before.""    But not everyone is convinced, with experts warning of an anthropocentric focus on language which risks forcing us to view things from one perspective. More like this:  • The scientists learning to speak whale • Scientists built this listening network to detect nuclear bomb tests. It found blue whales instead • The unknown giants of the deep oceans Young, though, describes the research as an ""incremental step"" towards understanding these giants of the deep. ""We're starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together,"" she says. And perhaps if we could listen and really understand something like how important sperm whales' grandmothers are to them – something that resonates with humans, she says, we could drive change in human behaviour in order to protect them.    Categorised as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), sperm whales are still recovering from commercial hunting by humans in the 19th and 20th Centuries. And, although such whaling has been banned for decades, sperm whales face new threats such as climate change, ocean noise pollution and ship strikes.    However, Young adds, we're still a long way off from understanding what sperm whales might be saying to each other.  ""We really have no idea. But the better we can understand these amazing animals, the more we'll know about how we can protect them."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

277,Should I stay or should I go? The dilemma for young Nigerians,"Nigerian graduate Olotu Olanrewaju is facing a choice between remaining in the country he loves and the possibility of a better life elsewhere. He adores the culture, food, music and family mentality at home, especially how people look out for each other and share common goals. But the 24-year-old electrical engineer feels he is being held back professionally. “I’m looking for greener pastures and better opportunities, rather than getting stuck here in Nigeria,” he tells the BBC’s What in the World podcast, adding that he thinks his degree would be “more appreciated” abroad. There is also the feeling that the lack of reliable basic infrastructure - causing things like power cuts - as well as security concerns, corruption and poor governance, all create unnecessary barriers to getting on with life. Mr Olanrewaju is one of tens of thousands of young, disenchanted Nigerians contemplating the move to join many others overseas. It’s a trend known by the Yoruba word “japa” meaning “to escape”. The BBC contacted several government officials for a response to what he and other young Nigerians told us but has not received a reply. The idea of emigrating from Nigeria is not new. Since the 1980s, many middle-class Nigerians have sought economic opportunities abroad, but the scale and urgency now feels different and japa is becoming increasingly popular with Gen Z and millennials. An African Polling Institute survey from 2022 found that 69% of Nigerians aged 18-35 would relocate given the opportunity - despite a slight fall from 2021. In 2019 the figure was just 39%. On social media, young Nigerians have taken to posting about their japa experiences. While some describe how they miss home, others show off the appeal of relocating, and encourage their peers to do the same. But leaving is a pricey venture. The rising cost of living, and the depreciation of the currency, the naira, has made an expensive process even harder - but also pushed more people to try to leave.   It is far easier for professionals and university graduates who have the skills and qualifications needed to secure well-paying jobs and visas in the West, as well as the finances to start a new life in a country where the cost of living is far higher than at home. As well as those seeking legal routes, many Nigerians try to move abroad without visas, by crossing the Sahara Desert or the Mediterranean Sea. Thousands of people die each year on the journey and those who make it often struggle to find work or somewhere decent to live. For years, Mr Olanrewaju and his parents have been saving up. He hopes to move to Germany or Spain and has signed up to German classes to improve his chances. He is not the first in his family to tread this path. Two years ago, his brother Daniel, now 27, managed to swap Nigeria’s sticky heat for the cooler shores of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. He works there as a photographer and social worker, and although he finds it a bit expensive, he tells his brother about the benefits of Scotland’s infrastructure – including the fact that people can rely on the electricity, water and transport systems working. Social worker Oluwatobi Abodunrin, 29, moved to London last year and also feels positive about her move. She says Nigeria is filled with “passionate, active youths” who want something more from their careers. “I decided to leave Nigeria because I wasn't getting what I want,” she says. “We are highly talented, we want to be recognised, we want our voice to be heard and we want to be respected.” She also acknowledges the difficulty of leaving friends and family behind. “It was a tough decision to leave home. To leave people who are sweet, kind, generous and passionate. But I'm happy I made the decision and it's going well.” There are more than 270,000 Nigerians like Ms Abodunrin living in the UK, according to government statistics. It is one of the most popular destinations for japa, with the number of Nigerians granted UK work visas quadrupling since 2019 as a result of post-Brexit immigration rule changes.  However, the UK has responded to this increase by tightening the rules for those seeking work visas. The US and Canada are also highly desirable. Canada has seen a surge in migration, with the number of Nigerians seeking residency there tripling since 2015, a phenomenon known as the “Canada Rush”. Back in Nigeria, zoology student Elizabeth Ademuyi Anuoluwapo recognises the difficulties in leaving, but feels it is the only way to get the financial stability she needs. “I’d miss my people, my food, my friends, my family. The vibe here is very cosy,” she says. “Maybe I’d go for a few years and then come back.” Japa has hit the medical profession especially hard. The Nigerian Medical Association said, in 2022, at least 50 doctors were leaving the country every single week. This has left an already overloaded healthcare system struggling. The government has said it will train more people to fill these gaps and backed a new bill that would require medical graduates to work in Nigeria for a minimum of five years after completing their training. It was fiercely opposed by doctors’ unions. A similar directive has also been issued for nurses, to get them to work in the country for at least two years before trying to leave. Some like Dr Vongdip Nankpah, from the University of Abuja teaching hospital, think it is important to stay. He believes that career goals are about more than an individual’s interest - they should involve the community and the value that a person can contribute to society. “If I’m going to maximise my medical practice, I’d rather remain in Nigeria to see if we can better the country and the region,” he says. “These are the things that are still driving my reasons for remaining in the country.” But despite the emotional attachment, Mr Olanrewaju does not feel he owes anything to Nigeria and would not feel guilty for leaving. “Most of my personal growth and gains, I worked for them myself,” he says. Instead, he would see himself as a representative of Nigerians abroad, standing for those who might not have the same opportunities to move overseas. For those who can afford it, japa is the ultimate choice. It promises a future of adventure, ambition and wealth, but also risks breaking ties with the past. Like many Nigerian students, Mr Olanrewaju is now measuring those benefits against the cost of what he is leaving behind.

284,Will K-pop's AI experiment pay off?,"There’s an issue dividing K-pop fans right now - artificial intelligence. Several of the genre’s biggest stars have now used the technology to create music videos and write lyrics, including boy band Seventeen. Last year the South Korean group sold around 16 million albums, making them one of the most successful K-pop acts in history. But it’s their most recent album and single, Maestro, that’s got people talking. The music video features an AI-generated scene, and the record might well include AI-generated lyrics too. At the launch of the album in Seoul, one of the band members, Woozi, told reporters he was ""experimenting"" with AI when songwriting. “We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it,"" he said. ""This is a technological development that we have to leverage, not just be dissatisfied with. I practised using AI and tried to look for the pros and cons.” On K-pop discussion pages, fans were torn, with some saying more regulations need to be in place before the technology becomes normalised. Others were more open to it, including super fan Ashley Peralta. ""If AI can help an artist overcome creative blocks, then that’s OK with me,"" says the 26-year-old. Her worry though, is that a whole album of AI generated lyrics means fans will lose touch with their favourite musicians. ""I love it when music is a reflection of an artist and their emotions,"" she says. ""K-pop artists are much more respected when they’re hands on with choreographing, lyric writing and composing, because you get a piece of their thoughts and feelings. ""AI can take away that crucial component that connects fans to the artists."" Ashley presents Spill the Soju, a K-pop fan podcast, with her best friend Chelsea Toledo. Chelsea admires Seventeen for being a self-producing group, which means they write their own songs and choreograph them too, but she’s worried about AI having an impact on that reputation. “If they were to put out an album that’s full of lyrics they hadn’t personally written, I don’t know if it would feel like Seventeen any more and fans want music that is authentically them”. For those working in K-Pop production, it’s no surprise that artists are embracing new technologies. Chris Nairn is a producer, composer and songwriter working under the name Azodi. Over the past 12 years he’s written songs for K-pop artists including Kim Woojin and leading agency SM Entertainment. Working with K-pop stars means Chris, who lives in Brighton, has spent a lot of time in South Korea, whose music industry he describes as progressive. “What I've learned by hanging out in Seoul is that Koreans are big on innovation, and they're very big on ‘what's the next thing?’, and asking, ‘how can we be one step ahead?’ It really hit me when I was there,” he says. “So, to me, it's no surprise that they're implementing AI in lyric writing, it's about keeping up with technology.” Is AI the future of K-pop? Chris isn’t so sure. As someone who experiments with AI lyric generators, he doesn’t feel the lyrics are strong enough for top artists. “AI is putting out fairly good quality stuff, but when you're at the top tier of the songwriting game, generally, people who do best have innovated and created something brand new. AI works by taking what’s already been uploaded and therefore can’t innovate by itself.” If anything, Chris predicts AI in K-pop will increase the demand for more personal songs. ""There's going to be pressure from fans to hear lyrics that are from the artist's heart, and therefore sound different to any songs made using AI”. Seventeen aren’t the only K-pop  band experimenting with AI. Girl group Aespa, who have several AI members as well as human ones, also used the technology in their latest music video. Supernova features generated scenes where the faces of band members remain still as only their mouths move. Podcaster and super-fan Chelsea says it ""triggered"" a lot of people. “K-pop is known for amazing production and editing, so having whole scenes made of AI takes away the charm,"" she adds. Chelsea also worries about artists not getting the right credit. “With AI in videos it’s harder to know if someone’s original artwork has been stolen, it’s a really touchy subject”. Arpita Adhya is a music journalist and self-titled K-pop superfan. She believes the use of AI in the industry is demonstrative of the pressure artists are under to create new content. “Most recording artists will put out an album every two years, but K-pop groups are pushing out albums every six to eight months, because there’s so much hype around them.” She also believes AI has been normalised in the industry, with the introduction of AI covers which have exploded on YouTube. The cover tracks are created by fans and use technology to mimic another artist's voice. It's this kind of trend that Arpita would like to see regulated, something western artists are calling for too. Just last month megastars including Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj wrote an open letter calling for the ""predatory"" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped. They called on tech firms to pledge not to develop AI music-generation tools ""that undermine or replace the human artistry of songwriters and artists, or deny us fair compensation for our work"". For Arpita, a lack of regulations means fans feel an obligation to regulate what is and isn’t OK. “Whilst there are no clear guidelines on how much artists can and can’t use AI, we have the struggle of making boundaries ourselves, and always asking ‘what is right and wrong?’” Thankfully she feels K-pop artists are aware of public opinion and hopes there will be change. “The fans are the biggest part and they have a lot of influence over artists. Groups are always keen to learn and listen, and if Seventeen and Aespa realise they are hurting their fans, they will hopefully address that.”",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngr3r0914o,"Megan Lawton,",2024-07-10 23:11:17,
285,Anger in Egypt after crash cyclist picked for Olympics,"With just two weeks to go until the Paris 2024 Olympics begin, many Egyptians are debating the decision to select as a competitor a cyclist who collided with a rival team-mate who was knocked into a cement barrier. In April, cyclist Ganna Eliwa, 19, was left concussed and with a broken right collarbone and severe cuts and bruises to the right-hand side of her body, according to a medical report, after she was pushed off her bike 300m (980ft) before the finishing line. In video of the incident, her opponent, Shahd Saeed, also 19, is seen riding behind Eliwa before she swerves, forcing Eliwa into the barrier. The latter underwent an operation to fix her right shoulder, suffered temporary loss of memory and is still unable to resume her business. Saeed said a couple of times that it was an accident, but Eliwa says her opponent never apologised for what happened. It is unclear what caused Saeed to swerve into the other rider. After an investigation into the incident, the Egyptian Cycling Federation suspended Saeed from the sport for one year and fined her the equivalent of $100 (£77) - the maximum penalty. Despite this, they still registered her name among the competitors in the Paris Olympics track cycling, causing public anger in Egypt. On Facebook, users swarmed the account of the federation, appealing to it to strike Saeed’s name off the list of competitors. One comment read: “Best of luck to all participants except for the rider who pushed her colleague. She’s not the best person to represent Egypt.” Eliwa also featured prominently on night-time talk shows, wishing Saeed bad luck. “I hope she can take part in the Paris Olympics because I’m pretty sure she would come last,” she told one TV presenter. The president of the Egyptian Cycling Federation said Saeed’s participation in the Olympics was “in favour of Egypt”, noting that the organisation could not remove her because it was too late to replace her. Many commentators compared Saeed to Mohammed Ali Rashwan, an Egyptian judoka who prized fair play above a gold medal at the Los Angles Olympics in 1984. ""By refusing to attack his opponent’s clearly injured right leg, the Egyptian judoka lost an obvious opportunity to be crowned Olympic champion, but instead he won worldwide acclaim and inner peace,” some quoted the International Olympic Committee as saying about Rashwan. Others said the choice of Saeed violated the three values of Olympism - excellence, respect and friendship - and urged authorities to reconsider their decision. Prompted by the criticism, the ministry of sports asked the Egyptian Olympic Committee to examine Saeed’s participation in Paris 2024 in light of “international accords and ethical rules”. After maintaining a long silence under fire, Saeed told a local newspaper this incident was in the past, questioning why it was raised again before the games. She again reiterated the incident was not “deliberate”. Cycling is not a popular sport in Egypt, but President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi frequently encourages men and women to get on their bikes.  He has been pictured numerous times leading hundreds of cyclists, including public figures, on a rally through Cairo at dawn.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwynzgxvzzo,"Wael Hussein,",2024-07-11 19:11:17,
283,Srebrenica massacre: 'What happened should be known',"Every July, Sabrija Hajdarevic returns to Srebrenica to visit the graves of her husband and father. They were among around 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys killed in 1995 by the Serb forces. The 67-year-old now lives thousands of miles away in Australia, but the annual trip means a lot to her. This year is even more poignant, as for the first time 11 July will be marked as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration, following a UN General Assembly ruling in May. The Srebrenica massacre, recognised by the UN as a genocide, was the shocking climax of the war in Bosnia - a conflict that erupted after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In Bosnia, one of the countries emerging after the breakup, three communities were in conflict – on the one hand, Bosnian Serbs, backed by Serbia, and, on the other, Bosniaks and Croats. About 40,000 Bosniak Muslims lived in Srebrenica. Many were forced to flee a Bosnian Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-95 war. The town was declared a UN safe zone in 1993 and a small group of international peacekeepers were charged with protecting it from any attacks. But in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces - led by military commander Ratko Mladic - stormed the town, overwhelming the peacekeepers who failed to protect the civilians sheltering there. The Serb forces rounded up the town’s men and boys, most of whom were never seen alive again. They were either killed in droves or murdered when they tried to escape through the wooded hills around Srebrenica. The brutal killing of around 8,000 men and boys became known as Europe's worst mass atrocity since World War Two. The remains of about 1,000 people are still missing. Ratko Mladic was later jailed for life for war crimes, including genocide, and nearly 50 Bosnian Serbs were also convicted. The recent UN resolution, designating 11 July an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide, also condemned any denial of the massacre and glorification of war criminals. But most Bosnian Serbs, as well as many people in Serbia, have repeatedly denied that what had occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 constituted genocide. Sabrija pushes back at claims that the Srebrenica killings were not targeted. “What happened should be known, instead of having all these lies flying around,” she says. “My soul hurts.” Some Bosniak families have been waiting for decades to lay their loved ones to rest, as the identification process is lengthy and difficult. Sabrija was able to bury her husband’s skull - the only body part which was unearthed. Her father’s remains are yet to be found, although she knows he was killed close to their house in Srebrenica as her mother witnessed the killing. Six months after her father’s murder, her mother died, too – “of sorrow,” says Sabrija, fighting back tears. Many victims of the Srebrenica massacre are buried at nearby Potocari cemetery. Thousands of simple white tombstones sit in a field on a slope of a hill, surrounded by woods. Berija Delic also lost her husband in the massacre. His remains were only found a decade later, and were buried in 2010. Last year, Berija decided to return to Srebrenica from Malta, where she sought refuge after the war. Her son, a Muslim, married a Serb Orthodox woman who “loves my baclava,” she says, referring to a sweet delicacy she cooks. Before the 1990s war, Srebrenica was largely a Bosniak Muslim town.  Now, the majority of the population is Serb; some of the residents had been soldiers during the conflict. “Even now you see someone walking around town, and you know that he has killed [Bosniaks] - but you remain silent, you cannot deal with that,” says Berija. Following the war, Bosnia was divided into two entities - Republika Srpska and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska. In the years since the war, the Bosniak population dwindled and the Serb population grew, but now they have one problem in common – unemployment. “Serbs and Bosniaks have no problems between them here, tensions are brought by people from the outside,” says Slavisa Petrovic, a 37-year old Serb who runs the local tourist office. But he says the town needs jobs for people to entice them to stay. The recent UN resolution on the massacre has not changed anything, Slavisa adds. “People are leaving Srebrenica now just like they as they did before it [the adoption of the resolution]. There are no jobs, just like there weren’t before.” There are signs of decline in the town. A once popular local spa and a formerly luxurious hotel are closed, having been abandoned for decades. Their walls are covered in graffiti. The roads leading to neighbouring villages, where farmers with healthy livestock once lived, are overgrown with weeds.  Many local homes are still in ruins. A mosque and a Christian Orthodox are sitting on a hillside overlooking the town, its wartime wounds unhealed. Serb and Bosniak children go to local kindergardens and schools together, and photographs of the new generation are proudly displayed in a public place in the centre of the town.  But it is most likely that the youngsters will soon leave for good. Slavisa is sad that locals keep abandoning the town. ""It feels like they are leaving my house,"" he says. Only three of his classmates are still living in Srebrenica. The rest have moved elsewhere. He, however, is determined to stay.  But even he admits that his four-year-old daughter is unlikely to feel the same when she grows up.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c147wler2vzo,"Natasa Andjelkovic,",2024-07-11 01:11:17,
282,From semi-pro soccer to Euro final - Watkins' 'unbelievable' rise,"This video can not be played Watkins score late winner for England ""I've been waiting for that moment for weeks,"" said Ollie Watkins afterwards - and boy did he take it. With the clock about to hit 90:00 in England's Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands, with the score at 1-1 in Dortmund, the ball fell to the striker from Devon, who was still playing in the English Football League just over four years ago at the age of 24. The Aston Villa man turned Stefan de Vrij and hammered a shot into the bottom corner for one of the most important England goals ever scored. Rewind nine years and he had just finished a loan spell at non-league Weston-super-Mare from League Two Exeter City. Asked after his Dortmund heroics whether he could have imagined this at the time, he said: ""You can dream but I am a realist. I was just focused on getting back into the first team at Exeter. ""I didn't dream about that to be honest. I can't lie and say I did. Scoring for England is amazing but I didn't think I'd do it in a tournament like that."" Watkins' winning goal more than justified Gareth Southgate's decision to choose him to replace England's all-time top scorer Harry Kane, with nine minutes to go. He came on alongside Cole Palmer, who set up his goal. ""I was wondering when the changes were going to happen. The changes were right and they were perfect,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Radio 5 Live. Former Brentford striker Watkins had only played 20 minutes at a major tournament before this, in the group stage against Denmark, having been left out of the Euro 2020 and 2022 World Cup squads. ""When I was on the bench I said to [sub keeper] Dean Henderson, 'I can make a difference today and need to get on'. I took my chance, scored it and now we are in the final. One last game,"" he said. That game is against Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final - as England bid to be European champions for the first time in men's football. This video can not be played 'The best feeling ever!' - Watkins on scoring England winner Unlike many England players, Watkins started his career lower in the football pyramid - at Exeter City. ""He had the perfect attitude, the perfect character and physical ability. He had all the boxes ticked yet, at 17, 18, 19 years old he never played as well as he should have done,"" said Paul Tisdale, Watkins' first manager at Exeter. At the age of 18, mostly playing on the wing, Watkins had made four first-team appearances for City before being sent on loan to Weston-super-Mare in the Conference South, the sixth tier. He scored 10 goals in 18 starts there - and broke into the Exeter team, as a striker. ""Suddenly the engine turned on. I've never seen a player have a quantum shift in their output as much as Ollie did,"" said Tisdale. He left for Championship Brentford in 2017 for £1.8m having scored 26 goals in 78 appearances for Exeter. Another 49 goals followed in 143 games for the Bees before he became the most expensive Championship player ever when he joined Aston Villa for £28m three years later. In this squad, only Ivan Toney - his rival for the spot to replace Kane late in games - has played more EFL games.  League games only (including play-offs) Watkins has kicked on at Villa with 70 goals in 169 games, hitting 19 Premier League goals last season to take his club into the Champions League. Dean Smith, who managed him at Brentford and Villa, said: ""I look at him now - he has become more of a selfish player, which is a good thing. ""His biggest strength could be his biggest weakness. He could beat himself up over things but it would also drive him. ""His emotional control now allows him to accept 'I will miss chances but I’ll be ready for the next one'."" Just last month Watkins said: ""Even when I first went to Villa, I'd just been bought for £30m and I was still unsure whether I deserved to be there.  ""I hadn't done it in the Premier League, so I would say there was a bit of that before. But now I'm in a really good place. ""I had a really good year, got the most assists in the league, scored a lot of goals and people still weren't including me in their squads to come to the Euros. ""Everyone has their own opinion, but I don't feel like I have that big profile where I'm talked about. Or where if I was left out of the squad, people would be like: 'Oh, I can't believe they didn't pick Ollie Watkins.' ""I'm happy I'm here now."" And so is Gareth Southgate. ""Ollie has trained every day and been ready to play, as the whole group has been,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new players in the group. Half have not been to a tournament but they have bonded so well, got each other's back and tonight was a good example of that."" Watkins' goal - timed at 89:59 - was the latest winning goal scored in a European Championship or World Cup semi-final, excluding extra time. It came with one of only 10 touches Watkins has had in the tournament. ""We talk about being ready,"" said Kane. ""We're a big team at being ready.  ""When it matters, you might get five minutes, one minute, but you can make a difference, you can win us a tournament. He's been waiting, he's been patient.  ""What he did was outstanding and he deserves it."" Ex-England striker Ian Wright was impressed watching the game for ITV. ""This is what Ollie Watkins does. This is the exact attitude I would want to have,"" he said.  ""You want Cole Palmer to come on and hit a pass that is perfect. In the moment, get back to the basics. It was absolutely perfect. Nobody did that to those defenders all night. They had an easy ride until he came on. ""Unbelievable moment. That's what you have come on to do - just take a shot. What's the worst that can happen? Ollie Watkins has done brilliantly. ""He's waited for his opportunity and he's done it. Now we're into the final. It's just amazing.""",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c134enzzg26o,Emlyn Begley,2024-07-11 23:11:17,
280,Carla Bruni-Sarkozy charged with witness tampering,"France's former first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has been charged over an election funding scandal dating back to 2007 involving cash from the then Libyan dictator, Col Muammar Gaddafi. According to French media, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, 56, was charged with hiding evidence and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud. She was placed under judicial control and barred from being in contact with all those accused except her husband, Nicolas Sarkozy.  Ms Bruni-Sarkozy is also suspected of concealment of witness tampering and involvement in an attempt to bribe Lebanese judicial personnel, among other violations. Her lawyers told AFP that Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was determined to assert her rights and challenge the ""unfounded decision"". Mr Sarkozy, who was the president of France from 2007 to 2012, is due to go on trial next year over allegations he took money from Gaddafi to finance his successful election bid. He is accused of corruption, illegal campaign financing, benefiting from embezzled public funds and membership in a criminal conspiracy. He has always denied all the charges. The investigation into the allegations was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then leader Gaddafi, first accused Mr Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding. The following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East, supported the claims. He told judges he had written proof that Mr Sarkozy's campaign bid was ""abundantly"" financed by Tripoli, and that the €50m (£43m) worth of payments continued after he became president. Years later, Mr Takieddine told French media that in 2006-07 he had personally handed over suitcases stuffed with banknotes to Mr Sarkozy and his chief of staff, Claude Guéant, who later denied this. But in 2020, Mr Takieddine suddenly retracted his statement about handing over large amounts of money. This raised suspicions that Mr Sarkozy and his allies - including his wife - might have paid him to change his mind. In June, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was found to have deleted messages exchanged with a French businesswoman who was questioned by police over accusations of witness tampering. Since losing his re-election bid to socialist François Hollande in 2012, Mr Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations. In 2023, he was given a suspended prison sentence for trying to bribe a judge, and earlier this year, he was found guilty of illegally funding his 2012 re-election campaign. He and Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, an Italian-born former supermodel and singer, married in 2008. They had a daughter, Giulia, in 2011.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xv3xewdno,"Laura Gozzi,",2024-07-10 23:11:17,
279,US says Gaza's floating aid pier to shut down soon,"The US says the floating pier designed to increase the amount of aid getting into the Gaza Strip will “soon cease operations”, less than two months after it was installed. The announcement came after the US military were unable to re-anchor the pier this week because of “technical and weather-related issues”. It had to be removed on 28 June because of bad weather. A Pentagon spokesman said more than 8,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been delivered from the pier while it was in operation. He also stressed that it had always been intended as a temporary solution. US officials suggested it would remain in place until August or September, when changing sea states in the Mediterranean might make it impossible to maintain. In fact, the weather proved challenging almost as soon after it started operating on 17 May. For a flagship scheme first announced by President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address in March, the JLOTS (Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore) has had a brief, chequered history. Following stormy weather in late May, four small landing craft involved in the operation broke loose and were washed ashore. Days later, parts of the pier were removed and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs. In mid-June, the whole structure, built by US engineers at a cost of $230m (£178m), was taken to Ashdod, again because of the weather. “Temporarily relocating the pier will prevent structural damage caused by the heightened sea state,” the Pentagon said at the time. The pier was re-anchored on 19 June, but operations paused again, less than a week later, “for scheduled maintenance activities”. The scheme was also buffeted by heavy political weather. When Israeli commandos rescued four hostages from the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp on 8 June, a video showing an Israeli helicopter taking off near the pier triggered speculation on social media that US forces were involved in the rescue. There was no evidence of American involvement, but the Pentagon was forced to issue a strongly worded denial. “The temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only,” it said. “To help move additional, urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza.” America’s role as Israel’s chief military and diplomatic backer meant that the pier was always likely to be the focus of Palestinian suspicions, however unfounded. “When the pier has worked as intended, it supplied Gaza with much needed aid,” one Gaza-based aid worker said. “However... its involvement in perceptions of partiality reduced its sustainability.” For a scheme designed to improve the provision of humanitarian aid, at a time when Israel’s military campaign had left many Gazans on the brink of starvation, what difference did it make? Joe Biden said the pier would “enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day”. At the end of June, US Central Command (Centcom) said more than 8,831 tonnes of aid had been delivered, with more than half of that arriving over the course of the previous week. But it also announced yet another setback, saying that “due to anticipated adverse weather”, the pier had to be moved back to Ashdod once more. It was due to be reinstalled this week to deal with a backlog of aid that has accumulated in Cyprus and on a floating dock moored off the Gaza coastline. But on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj Gen Pat Ryder announced that Centcom personnel were unable to re-anchor the pier to the shore. “The pier and support vessels and equipment are returning to Ashdod where they will remain until further notice. A re-anchoring date has not been set,” he said. He added: “As highlighted in the initial deployment announcement, the pier has always been intended as a temporary solution to enable the additional flow of aid into Gaza during a period of dire humanitarian need, with limited access, supplementing land and air channels of delivery."" ""The pier will soon cease operations, with more details on that process and timing available in the coming days.” The total delivered so far represents a tiny fraction of what is needed. According to the UN, about 500 aid trucks entered Gaza every day before the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October. The comparisons are imprecise, but over the course of two months, the US pier has delivered roughly the equivalent of one day’s pre-war aid delivery. And getting the aid ashore has only been part of the challenge. Delivering it, safely, to the people who need it is extremely hazardous. With Israeli troops this week mounting a fresh ground operation into nearby Gaza City, ensuring safety for aid workers remains as challenging as ever. The breakdown of law and order throughout the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel’s relentless targeting of anyone associated with Hamas, including police officers, means that looting - whether organised or opportunistic - is still rife. Aid that has made it ashore has often remained stuck in the Israeli-controlled marshalling yard, with aid agencies reluctant to collect and distribute it in such an insecure environment.",2024-07-11 23:11:17,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c725re0g447o,"Paul Adams,",2024-07-11 19:11:17,
278,Ugandan TikToker jailed for insulting president,"A Ugandan court has sentenced a 24-year-old man to six years in prison for insulting the president and the first family through his video posted on TikTok. Edward Awebwa was charged with hate speech and spreading ""misleading and malicious"" information against President Yoweri Museveni, First Lady Janet Museveni and son Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is the head of the military. The court also heard that Awebwa had shared abusive information and had said there would be an increase in taxes under President Museveni. He had pleaded guilty and asked for forgiveness. The presiding magistrate said that while he had pleaded for mercy, he did not look remorseful for his actions, and the words used in the video were ""really vulgar"". ""The accused deserves a punishment which will enable him learn from his past so that next time he will respect the person of the president, the first lady and the first son,"" magistrate Stella Maris Amabilis said. He was sentenced to six years for each of the four charges against him, which are to run concurrently. Rights groups regularly denounce Ugandan authorities for violations of human rights and freedom of expression. In 2022, award-winning Ugandan author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija was charged with two counts of ""offensive communication"" after making unflattering remarks about the president and his son on Twitter. He fled the country to Germany after spending a month in jail, where he claimed he had been tortured. Activist and writer Stella Nyanzi, who is also in exile, had earlier been jailed after publishing a poem that was critical against Mr Museveni. President Museveni has been in power since 1986 - 14 years before Awebwa was born. In 2022 he signed into law a against speech which rights groups criticised, saying it was aimed at suppressing freedom of speech online. Last year, the constitutional court ruled that a section of the act that penalised ""offensive communication"" was unconstitutional. Ugandan human rights lawyer Michael Aboneka said Awebwa had been charged under the same broader law that they are still challenging in court because “it is vague”. He told the BBC Newsday programme that the president and his family should expect to be criticised “at whatever angle”. “Unless they are saying that they are going to arrest every Ugandan for criticising them at every point,"" he said.

294,Paolini edges out Vekic in thriller to reach final,"This video can not be played Paolini beats Vekic in semi-final thriller Jasmine Paolini edged out a tearful Donna Vekic in a thrilling semi-final to become the first Italian to reach a Wimbledon women's singles final. In one of the best matches of the tournament, Paolini missed two match points and was 8-7 behind in the 10-point tie-break before recovering to clinch an incredible victory. The match lasted two hours 51 minutes, making it the longest women's singles semi-final at Wimbledon, with the Italian winning 2-6 6-4 7-6 (10-8). Seventh seed Paolini will now face Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova after she claimed a remarkable 3-6 6-3 6-4 comeback victory against Elena Rybakina, the 2022 champion. It means there will be a new name etched into the Venus Rosewater Dish following Saturday's final. Paolini, who had never won a match at this tournament before this year but who has gained huge popularity with her enthusiasm, bubbly personality and incredible shot-making skills, said: ""I was serving really bad so I am so happy. This match I will remember forever. “I was just trying to think about what to do on the court, point by point, because I was really in difficulty.” Vekic, who was also struggling with an injury to her lower right arm, was seen in tears at the changeover before the tie-break as the match was slipping away from her. ""I thought I was going to die in the third set,"" said a tearful Vekic in the post-match news conference. ""I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg. It was not easy out there, but I will recover. ""I was more crying because I had so much pain, I didn't know how I could keep playing. My team tells me I can be proud of myself.  ""It's tough right now. It's really tough to be positive right now. It was so close."" 'Emotional, cruel, euphoric' - the incredible semi-final 'I miss her so much' - Krejcikova remembers Novotna GB's Hewett into semi-finals despite shoulder injury This video can not be played Paolini reacts as she reaches first Wimbledon final Paolini lost in the French Open final in May and is the first woman to reach back-to-back Roland Garros and Wimbledon finals since Serena Williams in 2016. “I think these last months have been crazy for me,” added Paolini. “I don’t know, I am just trying to focus on what I have to do on court and enjoying what I am doing. “I love playing tennis. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid at Wimbledon. I am just enjoying it and trying to live in the present.” The 28-year-old Italian had lost all three of her matches here before this year, but has now created history - and has a chance of becoming the first Italian player, male or female, to win a Wimbledon singles title. Paolini had never reached the second week of a Grand Slam until six weeks ago when she made the French Open final. But she has quickly become a fans' favourite, with every successful point won against Vekic gaining a huge reception, with the majority of supporters cheering on the Italian. Paolini seemed to thrive on that support and the energy around Centre Court as Vekic struggled against her opponent and the crowd, which gave a deserved standing ovation to both players. Donna Vekic is set to move up to 21st in the world rankings, only two places off her best ever position, following her run to the Wimbledon semi-finals Croat Vekic, also aiming to reach her first Grand Slam final, stormed through the first set and then led 4-3 with a break of serve in the deciding set, needing only two holds of serve for victory. But amid sensational scenes on Centre Court, the hugely popular Paolini managed to instantly get the match back on serve. She failed to convert a match-point chance in the 10th game and then another two games later as the encounter went to a 10-point tie-break.  Vekic led 8-7 in that, as the lead had constantly changed hands and was two points from victory, but Paolini, chasing down every ball and able to unleash wonderfully-accurate forehand shots, went ahead and then kept her nerve to seal the win. Just a month ago, Vekic, 28, was on the verge of quitting tennis, having struggled with a run of injuries. But the world number 37 had found a golden run of form which could have rescued her career, with her set to move up 16 places in the rankings. Vekic was aiming to become the second successive unseeded player winning the women's tournament after Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic became the first female player to ever do so when she lifted the trophy 12 months ago. Vekic played a full part in a thrilling match that will live long in the memory, but Paolini was the one who was celebrating at the dramatic end. This video can not be played Barbora Krejcikova pays tribute to inspiration Jana Novotna after win Rybakina had fast become the favourite for the women's singles title at Wimbledon following a flurry of high-profile exits earlier in the tournament. After Paolini and Vekic played out the longest women's semi-final at Wimbledon, it looked like the 25-year-old would make quick work of Thursday's second match on Centre Court when she raced to a 4-0 lead before snapping up the first set. But Krejcikova struck back in the second and, with the crowd behind her, she needed just a single break of serve to take control of the decider. The 31st seed shot her arms into the air in celebration when fourth seed Rybakina fired long on the first match point. ""I am so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today,"" Krejcikova said. Asked if she ever believed she would reach a Wimbledon singles final, she said ""no, never"" before paying tribute to 1998 Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna, who coached Krejcikova before she died in 2017 at the age of 49. ""I am fighting for every ball and I am sure that is what she would want me to do,"" she added. It is the first time Krejcikova - a doubles specialist - has reached a Wimbledon singles final, and her first at a Grand Slam since she triumphed at the French Open in 2021. It marks a remarkable return to form for the 28-year-old, who had a far-from-perfect build-up to Wimbledon - winning just three matches in the five months before the Championships after struggling with a back injury and illness.",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cqv53y38z07o,Michael Emons and Emily Salley,2024-07-11 23:11:18,
296,From rough sleeping to advising Prince William,"Sabrina Cohen-Hatton has gone from rough sleeping as a teenager to visiting the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle to give him advice on tackling homelessness. She was able to give her own story to Prince William as proof that homeless people should not be ""written off"". ""I sit in front of you now with a job, a home, a family and a PhD,"" said Sabrina, who works as a fire service chief. Prince William marked the first year of his Homewards project with a visit to Lambeth in south London where he pleged: ""It is possible to end homelessness."" The prince delivered the message that there is nothing inevitable about homelessness and that it shouldn't be normalised. Meeting Homewards representatives in Brixton he said: “Homelessness is a complex societal issue, and one that touches the lives of far too many people in our society. However, I truly believe that it can be ended."" He spoke of the importance of ""shifting perspectives"" about homeless people and the need to ""focus on prevention, rather than simply managing the crisis"". Homewards is a five-year project based around six areas around the UK. That includes Newport in South Wales - and as a 15- and 16-year-old that was where Sabrina was sleeping rough, after the death of a parent and problems at home. Her way out was selling the Big Issue - ""I credit them with saving my life"" - and once she had secure accommodation she was able to get a job in the fire service, which became her career. She used this ""lived experience""  to tell Prince William and the Homewards project about what was needed. ""There were lots of closed doors in my face,"" she said. Even when support was meant to be available, she said in practice it could be hard for homeless people to have the confidence to access it. Or there can be practical barriers. She said she relied on her dog, called Menace, but many hostels wouldn't let people stay with pets. Sabrina also warned of how homelessness was linked to the ""pernicious"" long-term impact of poverty. She went on to become chief fire officer of West Sussex and has spoken widely about her own journey, including this latest role as an advocate for Homewards. Sabrina said Prince William showed a lot of ""empathy"" towards the issue of homelessness, which she suggested reflected some of the ""trauma"" in his early life. At the event in Brixton, Sabrina spoke alongside Chris Lynam, who recalled the intense ""loneliness"" that accompanied his own homelessness and drug addiction. ""It's a very isolating experience... society is quite hostile to homeless people,"" said Chris, who is now supporting Homewards' work in Sheffield. Prince William described it as an ""honour"" to hear Chris talk about his experiences. The homelessness project, operating in Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Lambeth, Newport, Sheffield and Northern Ireland, wants to find successful approaches that can be replicated elsewhere. There are links with employers about helping people into work. A partnership with Homebase provides starter packs of furniture to help those moving from homelessness into accommodation. There are efforts to identify sofa-surfing and addressing links between relationship breakdown and homelessness. Putting housing officers in schools has been tried to identify young people who might be at risk. Through the Duchy of Cornwall there are 24 homes being built with ""wrap-around support"" for people leaving homelessness - and Prince William is now involved in developing further plans. There is a push to change attitudes towards homelessness - and Sabrina talked about the need to get rid of the stigma. She said that for 20 years she hadn't told anyone about her own experiences, before becoming such a public speaker about homelessness. Matt Downie, chief executive of Crisis, says the Homewards project can challenge the ""cynicism and fatalism"" that says homelessness is inevitable. He says that even though the big picture has seen homelessness getting worse, the evidence exists to prevent it. Finland is given as an example of a sustained drive to end homelessness, with the claim that there are now only about 150 homeless families. In contrast in the UK, there are more than 100,000 households categorised as homeless. There have also been questions about whether a wealthy royal should be pronouncing on homelessness. The anti-monarchy group Republic has previously described it as ""crass and hypocritical"". But George Anderson, a Big Issue seller and medical researcher in London, welcomes that Prince William has used his high public profile to talk about homelessness. ""He encourages people who are distant from homelessness to feel empathy and care,"" says George. ""Given the pomp and ceremony around his official role, it is easy for people to question as to what he really knows about homelessness,"" says George. ""I am sure that he is aware of that whilst also knowing he is in a position, like his mother, to highlight the plight of homelessness to the media. ""His mother would have experienced similar, being photographed in a tiara at a ball one day, whilst serving soup in a homeless kitchen the next,"" says George, who sees the prince's interest as being linked to Princess Diana bringing her sons to homelessness charities when they were children.",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1weg5en21wo,"Sean Coughlan,",2024-07-11 13:11:18,
295,Tori Towey 'so relieved' to be in Ireland after Dubai ordeal,"A woman charged with criminal offences in Dubai after she was allegedly a victim of domestic violence has said she is ""so relieved... thankful and grateful"" to have returned to Ireland. Tori Towey, 28, faced charges including attempted suicide and consuming alcohol and had her passport destroyed. Her flight from Dubai landed in Dublin at 12:21 local time. ""I'm just so relieved, I just I can't believe it,"" Ms Towey told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Ms Towey added that the support of the Irish people and the media had been amazing. And, now she plans to see her family and friends. But first of all, Ms Towey said she is going to ""go home and rest"" after an ordeal she described as ""tiring"". Ms Towey, from County Roscommon, was working as a flight attendant with an airline based in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when she was charged with attempting suicide and consuming alcohol. Her case prompted an intervention by Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Simon Harris earlier this week after it was raised in the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament). Police in the UAE withdrew the charges against her on Wednesday and a travel ban was lifted. Ms Towey said she was ""so thankful and grateful to be back"" and spoke of her fear of not being able to return to Ireland. ""Obviously when my mother came out to me it was a massive help, but it was just the unknown and just not knowing anything, not knowing what's going to happen,"" she said. ""It's only kind of between yesterday and today that I kind of got clarity. I wasn't getting any answers, but I'm just glad to be back."" Ms Towey was speaking at the airport beside her mother, Caroline, and aunt Ann Flynn. Caroline said it is ""great to have her home"" and described the ordeal as ""a nightmare, a real nightmare"".  Ms Towey's mother said the plan now is to ""go home and get our heads together and move on"". Her case drew attention in Ireland when it was raised in the Dáil by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Tuesday. ""She has been the victim of the most gross domestic violence,"" Ms McDonald said. ""Her passport has been destroyed. There was a travel ban imposed on her."" The Irish government should make it ""absolutely plain to the authorities of Dubai that no woman should be treated in this way"", Ms McDonald told the Dáil, and that ""an Irish citizen, an Irish woman, will not be treated in this way"". The taoiseach thanked Ms McDonald for bringing the case to his attention and said he was ready to ""intervene"". Mr Harris said her treatment had been ""utterly, utterly unacceptable"". He went on to say Ms Towey had ""been the victim of male violence"". ""What Tori has been through is, I think, unimaginable for so many people here in this country, that a woman who has been the victim of a brutal attack found herself waking up not in a hospital, but in a police station,"" Mr Harris added. On Wednesday, the taoiseach told the Dáil that a travel ban preventing Ms Towey from leaving the UAE had been lifted and Irish embassy staff would be escorting Ms Towey to the airport. After her arrival in Dublin Airport on Thursday afternoon, Ms Towey thanked the taoiseach, Ms McDonald, Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin and the Irish ambassador to the UAE. She also thanked human rights advocate and lawyer Radha Stirling from Detained in Dubai, who assisted her case.",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84j1r3pxk1o,Unknown,2024-07-11 16:11:18,
293,The marathon Indian wedding turning heads around the world,"How much is too much? That's the question many in India are asking as the months-long wedding festivities for the youngest son of Asia's richest man enter their final phase. The celebrations are expected to culminate this weekend when Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, ties the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant.   There have been four months of lavish events leading up to the wedding itself. All the glamourous outfits, stunning jewellery, fairytale-like decor and rare performances by Indian and global stars have been the focus of much public attention. ""It is nothing short of a royal wedding,"" says writer and columnist Shobhaa De. ""Our billionaires are the new Indian maharajahs. Their shareholders expect nothing less than a mega extravaganza."" Indians ""have always loved pomp and pageantry - just like the British"", she says, adding that ""the scale [of the wedding] is in keeping with the Ambani wealth"". But the hullabaloo around the wedding has drawn as much ire as public fascination. Many have criticised the opulence and the sheer magnitude of wealth on display in a country where tens of millions live below the poverty line and where income inequality is extreme.  ""[The wedding] can easily be seen as a kind of a mockery, a sort of blindness to the reality of the country at one level. At another level, however ridiculous this might be, it is still in keeping with the grossly distorted, almost grotesque bloating of Indian weddings in the last decade or so,"" writer and commentator Santosh Desai tells the BBC. ""It is part of a larger shift that is taking place. A generation or two ago, wealth was spoken of in whispers. Today, wealth must speak as loudly as possible. Even then, the scale of this wedding makes it an outlier.""  With a sprawling business empire - ranging from oil, telecoms, chemicals, technology and fashion to food - the Ambanis are a ubiquitous presence in India and their lives are the subject of intense public fascination. Mr Ambani's personal fortune is estimated at a staggering $115bn (£90bn). Anant, 29, holds a position on the Reliance Industries board of directors. Ambani senior, along with fellow Indian business tycoon Gautam Adani, is reported to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, with opposition parties accusing the authorities of unduly favouring the two business houses - accusations both the government and the businessmen deny. While the Ambani family’s enormous wealth and clout are well known in India, many outside the country may not have realised the extent of their riches until now. That changed in March, when Mr Ambani hosted a three-day pre-wedding party for his son. The festivities were held in the family's hometown Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, which is also the location of Mr Ambani's oil refinery - the largest in the world. Some 1,200 guests attended, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates. The party began with a dinner held inside a glasshouse especially built for the occasion. The stunning structure reportedly resembles Palm House, a crystalline Victorian-style building located in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which was a favourite of Ms Merchant when she was a college student in New York City. The feast was followed by a performance by Rihanna and viral videos showed the Ambani family grooving with the popstar on stage. If people hadn't been paying attention, they definitely were now. Through it all, dozens of speciality chefs served some 2,000 dishes, carefully curated from around the world, to guests lodged in luxury tents, with personal makeup artists and stylists at their service.  There was also a 10-page manual on the dress code for the events, which included a ""jungle fever"" theme for a visit to a family-owned animal sanctuary, followed by a Moulin Rouge-themed ""house party"" held at the sprawling grounds of their palatial residence. The bride-to-be wore a number of specially crafted outfits, including two lehngas (long bridal silk skirts) - one studded with 20,000 Swarovski crystals and another that reportedly took 5,700 hours to make - and a pink version of a Versace dress that actor Blake Lively wore to the 2022 Met Gala.  The groom mostly wore Dolce & Gabbana outfits and flaunted a Richard Mille wristwatch, worth an estimated $1.5m. A viral video of Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan gawking at the watch went viral in India. Newspapers and websites perfectly captured the opulence of these dazzling events, attended by the glitterati from around the world. ""It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,"" the New York Times reported. There was also backlash after India's government overnight designated the city's small airport into an international airport, expanded its staff and deployed military and air force personnel in service of the family. The final night of the three-day jamboree, which ended with a shower of confetti, fireworks and a lightshow, set the tone for what was to come next. In June, the couple and their guests took their pre-wedding celebrations overseas, literally. The party, which included top Bollywood stars, embarked on a luxury cruise along the stunning azure coastline of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy, to the French Mediterranean.  They stopped in Rome, Portofino, Genoa and Cannes for late-night revelry that reportedly brought complaints from local people. This time, the celebrations had performances by 90s teen heartthrobs The Backstreet Boys, singer Katy Perry and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. This week, yet another set of wedding celebrations kicked off on the family's home turf, Mumbai, with a performance by Justin Bieber. A video of him singing at the edge of the stage as the bride and her friends sing along has been viewed 38 million times. It shows ecstatic women in sequined gowns and saris as they punch their fists skyward in glee. The crowd doesn't miss a beat to Bieber's verse: You should go and love yourself. The scale of the celebrations show that nothing is out of reach for the family. And there is speculation that Adele could be performing at the actual wedding this weekend - the family, however, are tight-lipped. Of course, India isn't a stranger to the concept of big fat weddings - the country is the largest spender on marriage ceremonies after the US.  Tina Tharwani, co-founder of the Shaadi Squad, says in recent years, there's been a noticeable trend where weddings have become larger-than-life events that veer towards excessiveness, driven by societal expectations, competitive displays of status, and a desire to create memorable moments. So, we've seen expensive weddings routinely make headlines in recent years, such as this $74m wedding in 2016. Other Ambani children have also had lavish pre-wedding festivities. Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among attendees at Isha Ambani's pre-wedding bash in 2018, which featured a performance by Beyoncé. A year later, Akash Ambani's pre-wedding bash featured a performance by Coldplay. When it comes to scale, though, this is the mother of all weddings, says Ashwini Arya, owner of an event management company that has managed weddings in 14 countries.  ""It's like the bible for the industry with the best of logistics, tech, design and grandeur. ""You're talking about preparations of a minimum of two years, multiple recce trips, approvals and permissions from several countries, along with the logistics of arranging security and transport for some of the biggest personalities of the world,"" he says. The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them but Mr Arya estimates that they ""have already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m]"". It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Bieber is $10m.  Money was also lavished on constructing 14 temples inside a sprawling complex in Jamnagar to showcase India's cultural heritage and provide a backdrop for the wedding. As part of the celebrations, the Ambanis hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples too.  It's being said the family pulled out all the stops because with all the Ambani children married, this would be their last wedding for the foreseeable future.  But with each event, public criticism of the celebration in India has grown - from people aghast at the massive jewels worn by Nita Ambani to exasperation and anger among Mumbai residents over traffic restrictions in a city already struggling with traffic jams and monsoon flooding. For India's wedding industry though, it’s still an exciting marketing opportunity. This is an excellent chance for designers to showcase the more refined side of India's couture, artistry and craftsmanship, says Anand Bhushan, a fashion designer. That said, the frequency, with celebrities changing five-six outfits per event can sometimes feel a ""little saturating"", he admits. Ms Tharwani says the wedding serves as “an exemplary case” of orchestrating a multi-event, multi-location celebration ""that combines tradition, modernity, and unmatched hospitality standards"". Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Varindar Chawla, one of Bollywood's best-known paparazzi, is sifting through the photographs of the celebrations. There are a few of celebrities posing at the entrance as they arrive to attend the various events. Each one of these pictures - even the unflattering ones, such as of a star looking stunned as the glare of a camera-flash hits them in the face - has been fetching millions of views and shares. “Usually it’s hard to penetrate events of this scale. But this family has gone out of the way to ensure we are there to cover every little detail,"" he says.  ""It's a royal wedding and we are getting a royal treatment.""",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87repz4yx8o,"Zoya Mateen and Meryl Sebastian,",2024-07-10 23:11:18,
292,England on 'brink of history' - Lineker,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Everything will be crossed for England - Lineker Former England striker Gary Lineker says Gareth Southgate's side are on the ""brink of history"" after reaching the Euro 2024 final. The Three Lions beat the Netherlands 2-1 in Dortmund on Wednesday night to book a spot in Sunday's final against Spain. It is the first time the men's side have reached a final outside England after playing the 1966 World Cup final and 2021 Euro final at Wembley, while the women's Euro victory in 2022 came on home soil. England's men have never won the European Championship, with their World Cup win in 1966 their only major silverware, while Spain are three-time European champions. ""I think it's hugely significant for English football,"" Lineker, who will present BBC One's coverage of the final on Sunday, told BBC Sport. ""They were in a final, they were in the last final of the Euros, of course, and that was at Wembley, and that ended up in huge disappointment [losing to Italy on penalties]. ""This is going to be tough, it's going to be difficult, but they're on the brink of history. No English team in football has ever won a major tournament abroad."" The closest a senior England team have come to winning a major tournament outside of England was in 2023, when the Lionesses were beaten by Spain in the World Cup final in Australia. Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in Dortmund on Wednesday but Harry Kane equalised from the penalty spot midway through the first half before Ollie Watkins scored the winner in the 90th minute. Watkins' winner was England's fourth goal of the tournament scored past the 80th minute, including extra time. ""They have got that kind of never-say-die attitude, which is something that is hugely important,"" said Lineker, who scored 48 goals in 80 appearances for England. ""Even when they weren't playing great, they were grinding out results. And it's an old football cliche that if you can win when you play badly, then things are not that bad."" Gary Lineker was capped 80 times by England  Spain have been in the eyes of many observers the outstanding team in Germany this summer and are favourites heading into Sunday's final. After a slow start, England have found some rhythm in the knockout stages and the win against the Netherlands was their best display of the tournament so far. ""I don't really think I'm surprised at how we have done it, because we've got the individuals, world-class footballers right across the pitch,"" Lineker continued. ""Yes, they started slowly and something wasn't quite right about things but they've worked it out and they've got gradually better as the tournament progressed. It's much better that way round."" So, is football coming home? ""I'm banning that statement,"" said Lineker. ""It's been bad luck for so long.""

291,Capsey guides England to T20 series win over New Zealand,"This video can not be played England beat New Zealand to seal series win Third women's T20 international, Canterbury New Zealand 141-8 (20 overs): Devine 58* (42); Ecclestone 4-25 England 142-4 (19.2 overs): Capsey 67* (60); Jonas 2-23 England won by six wickets and lead five-match series 3-0 Scorecard Alice Capsey hit an unbeaten 67 as England clinched a tense six-wicket win over New Zealand in the third T20 international to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Sophie Ecclestone's masterful 4-25 helped restrict the Kiwis to 141-8 while Lauren Filer (2-17) and Sarah Glenn (1-14) also bowled eye-catching spells. New Zealand were indebted to skipper Sophie Devine who accelerated in the final few overs to finish unbeaten on 58 off 42 balls after opener Suzie Bates had made 38. England lost in-form Maia Bouchier for a first-ball duck but Capsey and Sophia Dunkley (35) enjoyed a 66-run stand for the second wicket. Nat Sciver-Brunt, skippering the side after Heather Knight was rested, also departed without scoring but 19-year-old Capsey batted with maturity to see England home. With 28 runs required off 17 balls for victory Capsey whacked Amelia Kerr down the ground for a towering six to signal England's charge. Freya Kemp bludgeoned 16 off eight balls before Capsey hit the winning runs - albeit via a streaky shot and misfield - with four balls to spare. The fourth game takes place at Kia Oval on Saturday from 18:30 BST.  This video can not be played Capsey hits Kerr for 'big' six The margin of victory in the previous three one-day internationals and two T20s between the two sides had been so emphatic that England are heading into experimentation territory. In this contest that stretched to Knight sitting out and giving Sciver-Brunt a whirl at skippering the side under the guise of 'what if..?' contingency planning for the T20 World Cup, which takes place in Bangladesh in October.  Should Knight come a cropper in the tournament in Bangladesh the experienced Sciver-Brunt would be a more than capable stand-in – although that was probably already obvious before this match. England also gave opener Danni Wyatt the night off which afforded the talented Dunkley an opportunity at the top as she played her first T20 international since March and her breezy innings gave the hosts a positive start. It was Capsey’s innings that will have pleased England the most, though. The teenager is known for her attacking strokeplay but on occasions her aggressive intent can get the better of her. So the manner in which she batted in Canterbury to get England within striking distance of the total before upping the ante shows a growing maturity to go with her fearless talent. ""I love batting number three it is the best place to bat in T20,"" Capsey told Sky Sports. ""I feel like I have a good understanding of my game. I just want to perform for England so I'm happy to get a performance in today."" It was Capsey's top score in T20s for England - eclipsing knocks of 51 against Sri Lanka and Ireland in 2023.  That it came at a much slower strike-rate - 111.66 - compared to her other three T20 half-centuries does not matter a jot in the bigger picture. England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt: ""With a bowling attack we have got and the people on the sidelines waiting to come in it is a pretty easy job to chuck the ball to different people, so I'm happy I could keep the winning streak going. ""The last few overs were pretty nervy but the calmness they showed was pretty special. ""We don't want to do it all the time but putting ourselves under pressure like that and then come out the other side, if we can take to [the World Cup in] Bangladesh, that would be perfect."" New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine: ""We asked the group to be more competitive, have fight and ticker and we had that. I am really proud of the group - it has been a tough tour so far and to take them so close today was encouraging.  ""Our batters showed intent and were clear on how they wanted to score. To see those learnings is something we've asked for and we're starting to see with this group. I've still got a huge amount of belief in this group but we're working towards the pinnacle event at the end of the year.""

290,Man Utd close to £33.7m deal for striker Zirkzee,"Joshua Zirkzee made his first Netherlands appearance at Euro 2024 after replacing injured midfielder Frenkie de Jong Manchester United are close to completing a £33.7m deal to sign Dutch striker Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna. United sources say the club are set to pay a slight premium on the £33.67m release clause in order to secure an extended payment period for the 23-year-old. The Premier League club are determined to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) regards loss limits and accept their present situation is tight and will require discipline in their transfer dealings. Long-serving forward Anthony Martial left Old Trafford at the end of last season when his contract expired. The Frenchman’s extended absence because of injury, in addition to Marcus Rashford’s drop in form, left new signing Rasmus Hojlund to shoulder the striking burden.  Van Nistelrooy returns to Man Utd in coaching reshuffle Dutchman Van de Beek joins Girona from Man Utd  Hojlund ended up losing his place in Ten Hag’s starting line-up for the FA Cup final win over Manchester City as the manager used Bruno Fernandes in a false nine role. Zirkzee joined Bayern Munich from Feyenoord in 2017 before moving to Bologna for about £7.15m five years later after loan spells with Parma and Anderlecht. He scored 12 goals in 37 appearances last season as Bologna claimed a surprise spot in this season’s Champions League. Zirkzee was named in Ronald Koeman’s Euro 2024 squad but made just two substitute appearances for the Netherlands, totalling four minutes, plus injury time. He was introduced into Wednesday’s semi-final defeat by England immediately after Ollie Watkins’ winner.

289,Baltimore bridge survivor describes horror of collapse,"The sole survivor of the Baltimore bridge disaster has told how he watched friends and relatives fall from the structure and die as he fought for his own life. ""I relive it all the time, the minutes before the fall and when I'm falling,"" Julio Cervantes Suarez told NBC News in his first interview since the 100,000-ton cargo ship, the Dali, crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge on 26 March.  Mr Cervantes Suarez, 37, was one of seven maintenance workers fixing potholes at the time of impact. The force threw the van he was in off the structure and into the the Patapsco river around 180ft (50m) below. He said he prepared for death. ""I thanked God for the family he gave me. I asked him to take care of my wife and kids. And I asked for forgiveness,"" he said in an interview in Spanish.  He struggled in vain to open the doors as water rose to his neck, then managed to force a window open - squeezing out just before the vehicle sank. Unable to swim, he clung to a piece of wreckage and waited for rescue.  ""That's when I realised what happened. I looked at the bridge and it was no longer there,"" he said.  Mr Cervantes Suarez said he saw co-workers - some of whom were family - as ""the water covered them"".  ""I started to call out to each by name,"" he said. ""But no one answered me."" The first to fall was his nephew, Carlos Daniel Hernández, who was in a car when the Dali smashed into the bridge.  Mr Cervantes Suarez said he had told the 24-year-old, whom he considered a son, to take a break in the vehicle. ""If I had told him to come with me, maybe it would have been different,"" he said.  ""Maybe he would be here with us."" The other victims were:  The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after the Dali  lost power, veered off course and smashed into the structure. Rescuers searched the waters for days to recover the bodies of all the victims.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. A lawyer for Mr Cervantes Suarez and other victims told NBC that he was considering legal action against the Dali's Singapore-based owner, Grace Ocean.  Mr Cervantes Suarez said he wanted those responsible to ""pay"" for the damage, but said he knew that it would not bring back his loved ones and co-workers.  ""I know that money is not going to buy a hug from a father or a son,"" he said. ",2024-07-11 23:11:18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51ykdlg08do,"Madeline Halpert,",2024-07-11 15:11:18,
288,Girmay wins again as Roglic crashes and loses time,"Biniam Girmay now leads the green jersey points classification by a huge 111 points History-maker Biniam Girmay sprinted to his third victory at this year's Tour de France but overall contender Primoz Roglic lost significant time after a late crash on stage 12. Eritrean Girmay became the first black African to win a Tour de France stage with his opening win on stage three and also triumphed on stage eight. Intermarche-Wanty rider Girmay, 24, beat Wout van Aert in a frantic bunch sprint in Villeneuve-sur-Lot, with Mark Cavendish originally finishing fifth before being relegated. Tadej Pogacar retained the leader's yellow jersey and remains one minute six seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard a further eight seconds behind. But podium contender Roglic, who finished with a ripped jersey and bloodied shoulder, dropped from fourth to sixth in the general classification after he lost two minutes 27 seconds on the leaders after being caught up in a late crash. Pogacar, of UAE Team Emirates, was also held up behind a crash in the peloton early in the stage, and required a bike change, but re-joined the main group without issue. The 203.6km route from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot offered one of the few remaining opportunities for a bunch sprint - assuming the sprinter's teams could control any potential breakaway. A four-man group featuring Groupama-FDJ riders Valentin Madouas and Quentin Pacher, Jonas Abrahamsen of Uno-X Mobility and Total Energies' Anthony Turgis managed to open up a three-and-a-half-minute advantage over the peloton. But that move was shut down with more than 40km remaining to set up a long-inevitable dash to the line, in which Girmay prevailed to further assert himself as the fastest sprinter at this year's race. In doing so he also extended his lead in the green jersey points battle, opening up a likely unassailable 111-point advantage over Jasper Philipsen. ""The green jersey gives me wings - I feel super fast. It's in the head. I've had my ups and downs in recent seasons but I changed things this year and it's working,"" Girmay said. A rare moment of calm in the peloton was interrupted with 12km remaining when Alexey Lutsenko crashed and took down Slovenian Roglic. The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe rider had been one minute 31 seconds adrift of the podium but that deficit now stands at three minutes 28 seconds. Reacting to Roglic's incident, race leader Pogacar said: ""It is really devastating. He was in very good shape already and I could feel he was getting better with every stage.  ""I’m pretty sure he would have been fighting for the GC in the next few days."" Both Astana Qazaqstan rider Cavendish and Arnaud Demare, of Arkea-B&B Hotels, were relegated following illegal moves they made in the sprint. Stage 13 on Friday is a relatively flat 165.3km route from Agen to Pau but, as the race enters the Pyrenees, hilly terrain approaching the finish could prove difficult for the sprinters. That is one of only two expected remaining opportunities for the sprinters - including Cavendish, who claimed a record 35th Tour de France stage win last week - to take victories at this year's race, along with stage 16 in Nimes.

287,England have to be 'perfect' to beat Spain - Southgate,"Gareth Southgate has reached three semi-finals with England  England will have to be ""tactically perfect"" to beat Spain in Sunday's Euro 2024 final, manager Gareth Southgate says. England's men booked their first appearance in a major final on foreign soil with a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in their semi-final on Wednesday.  It's the third time in the past four major competitions that Southgate has guided England to the semi-final stage of either the Euros or the World Cup.  Southgate says three-time winners Spain are the ""favourites"" for the final as England's men bid to win their first Euros title.  ""They would be rightly favourites for what they have done this tournament. They have been the best team,"" said Southgate.  “They have got a day longer and in the past three finals, maybe more, it has been quite significant, so we have got to get our recovery spot on. “Tactically we will have to be perfect as they are such a good side. But, you know, we are here."" Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice says England's defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final will serve as motivation on Sunday. Italy beat England 3-2 on penalties at Wembley after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes in London. ""Seeing Italy lift that trophy will haunt me forever,"" said Rice. ""We are now presented with another opportunity where we can write our own history but we are up against another top side who we have to massively respect. ""Hopefully now we can do it. Not only for each other but also for the manager. I think he deserves it."" Chelsea's Cole Palmer said the side can ""finish the job"" and change their lives forever by winning in Berlin.  Palmer came off the bench to provide the assist for fellow substitute Ollie Watkins' last-minute winner in Dortmund.  ""Everyone's buzzing,"" the midfielder told the England YouTube channel.  ""Last night on the bus, tunes were on, [in the] changing room, everyone was just enjoying it. ""But obviously it's a short turnaround and it's a massive, massive game to change our lives, our family's lives, and to make everyone proud. That's what we're trying to do.  ""I think if you've got to this final then you have to hopefully finish the job. It's all good getting to the final, and you've got to enjoy it because you don't get many moments to enjoy. But, no, everyone just wants to win so bad.""

Palmer, who won the European Championship at Under-21 level with England in 2023, feels the Three Lions have found their rhythm.  ""In the first few games, we didn't play the best that we could and everyone knew that,"" added Palmer. ""But now I think as the tournament's gone on, especially yesterday, I think we had our best game in the tournament, and that's what you want going into the later stages. ""It's huge. We played them last year in the Under-21s final, England versus Spain.

286,Anderson takes two to help England towards big win,"This video can not be played Anderson bowls West Indies captain Brathwaite for four First Rothesay Test (day two of five), Lord's: West Indies 121 (Atkinson 7-45) & 79-6 (Anderson 2-11) England 371 (Crawley 76, Smith 70, Root 68; Seales 4-77) West Indies trail by 171 runs Scorecard James Anderson took two wickets in his final innings as an international bowler to help put England on course for a huge win over West Indies in the first Test at Lord’s. Anderson, opening the attack for the last time in his record-breaking England career, began the hosts’ hunt for an innings victory by bowling West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite and returned to have Alick Athanaze caught behind. With captain Ben Stokes also taking two wickets and Gus Atkinson two of his own, including Jason Holder off the final ball of the day, West Indies were left 79-6, still 171 short of making England bat again. The tourists had actually done well to bowl England out for 371, but are paying the price for being hustled out for 121 on the opening day. Jamie Smith, England’s wicketkeeper on Test debut, showed why he has such a reputation as a batting talent with an assured 70. Joe Root made a typically elegant 68 and Harry Brook 50, though none of the home top order could capitalise on some good batting conditions with a really big score. Still, England will win this match on a Friday which promises to be an emotional farewell to the legendary Anderson. Catch-up: Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer TMS podcast: Anderson takes two as England close on victory West Indies' Test problems not solved by money - Lara This video can not be played Mikyle Louis' 'terrific throw' sees Bashir run out for a duck After an opening day of ceremony for Anderson and excitement surrounding the seven-wicket haul of Gus Atkinson, Thursday was relatively low key, with England not having to be at their best to take an iron grip on the contest. Lord’s was splashed with red for the Ruth Strauss Foundation and the fireworks that shot into the sky before play were the only pyrotechnics on display until Smith opened his shoulders late in England’s innings. England began on 189-3, leading by 68. West Indies had a poor first hour, but improved after Brook was dismissed to work through the home batting. England actually lost their last seven wickets for 127 runs, the highlight of which was Mikyle Louis running out Shoaib Bashir with a direct hit from 40 yards, then setting off on a sprinting celebration that culminated with a hug with his brother Jeremiah, who is also in the West Indies squad. West Indies began their second innings straight after tea and, at 37-4, there was a genuine prospect of the first two-day Test on this ground since 1888. Athanaze, Holder and Joshua da Silva did just enough to drag the match into a third day, but surely nothing will prevent England going 1-0 up in the three-match series. This video can not be played Best shots of Smith's 50 Smith has taken over behind the stumps from his county team-mate Ben Foakes, who is Surrey’s first-choice keeper and arguably the best gloveman in the world. England have seen Smith’s potential to bat in different gears, particularly attacking when left with the tail and, on the day before his 24th birthday, he hinted at vindicating their decision. Brook played nicely before flapping at an Alzarri Joseph bouncer, not the first time he has been undone by short bowling, and Stokes registered his fifth successive single-figure score in Tests with a poor shot at a very good delivery from left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie. Smith found an even tempo with Root, who was also bowled by the impressive Motie, then after Chris Woakes and Atkinson fell in quick succession to the second new ball, he cut loose. Favouring the mid-wicket region and keen to use his feet, Smith hit each of Shamar Joseph and Jayden Seales over the leg side for six, the latter an enormous blow on to the roof of the Tavern Stand. From having 30 off his first 47 balls, he took 40 off his next 42. In all, England added 28 runs for the final two wickets, though only Smith scored any runs off the bat until he was well held at deep square leg by Kirk McKenzie to give Seales his fourth wicket. This video can not be played Anderson gets a wonderful reception as he comes out to bat Emerging at number 11, Anderson was given a standing ovation as he made his way to the middle, then even led the players off despite not facing a ball. His unbeaten nought was his 114th not-out in Test cricket, 53 more than anyone else has managed and another of his records that is unlikely to ever be broken. Soon after he was into a typically brilliant opening spell from the Pavilion End, nipping the ball down the slope and through Brathwaite’s defence. Anderson’s first spell of five overs contained four maidens. Woakes was down on pace and gave way to Stokes, who needed only three deliveries to pin McKenzie leg-before for his 200th Test wicket, a milestone that seemed unlikely during his long struggle with a left-knee injury. It made the skipper only the third man in Test cricket, after all-time greats Sir Garfield Sobers and Jacques Kallis, to complete the double of 6,000 runs and 200 wickets, and he celebrated by having Louis caught behind. Atkinson continued his fine game by having Kavem Hodge chop on. Athanaze was defying England in the gloom until he became yet another victim that Anderson has suckered into an edge. Holder faced 59 deliveries for his 20 only to fend Atkinson to short leg from the last ball of the day, leaving Da Silva on eight and Anderson poised to say goodbye. Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan: ""It's been a ruthless display by England. There was all the build-up, all the emotion of Anderson but both debutants have delivered. ""Gus Atkinson yesterday, and Jamie Smith today did his job at the first time of asking. He has been picked to exploit those last few wickets for England and he did that perfectly. ""But West Indies are all over the place. It is so sad to see a batting line-up that's got nothing. They are up against a very good bowling attack including the greatest of all time but it upsets me. The pitch has done a little bit but it's not a pitch you should lose 16 wickets on in the space of two days.""

298,Many Democrats are sticking with Biden. Here's why,"Headlines scream for Joe Biden to quit. Donors threaten to withhold campaign funds, and a growing list of Democrats call time on the president's career. But for all the stories dominated by the latest politician, fundraiser or left-wing actor to voice their displeasure, a longer list of Democrats are sticking by him. At least 80 Democratic politicians have publicly backed the 81-year-old, and more are joining them as he insists he is going nowhere.  To many, his political record, his principles and his 2020 victory over Donald Trump mean more than the damage of a rambling performance in any debate or public appearance, or health fears during a new four-year term. Mr Biden's first solo news conference of the year on Thursday, though hampered by mistakes, sparked several more public expressions of support. “Tonight, President Biden was knowledgeable, engaging, and capable,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on social media afterwards. “No one is more prepared to lead our nation forward than Joe Biden.” Gavin Newsom, the California governor touted as a possible successor, told CBS on Friday he was ""all in"" for Mr Biden, adding that there was ""no daylight"" between them. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said Mr Biden ""showed he knows a million times more about policy"" than Trump, ""the convict conman"". Experts say these politicians have a host of reasons for their support, including Mr Biden's record in office, his 2020 victory against Trump and the gamble of putting in a new candidate so close to the November election.  ""The president has made it clear he wants to continue to run, and I think people are being very respectful of that,"" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist. ""And it's also true that in our system, replacing a candidate for president this late is hard and is unprecedented, and so there's enormous reticence about making a big change."" He added that there was a ""healthy debate"" about who the nominee should be. However, a range of groups have said that the candidate should be Mr Biden, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr Biden met earlier this week.  Ameshia Cross, a former Obama campaign adviser, said that the black caucus, as well as many black voters, see Mr Biden as a president committed to civil rights, unlike his rival, Trump.  ""They understand what is at stake with a Donald J Trump presidency,"" she said. ""This is a guy who has stood against DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.""  Mr Biden has received public support from several politicians on the left, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have previously criticised Mr Biden for an agenda they have said is not progressive enough.  Ms Cross said many recognise the risks a Trump presidency brings to civil and LGBTQ rights, and climate change. ""These are things that matter to the progressive left, and the president has actually worked on those things,"" she said.  To date, most of Mr Biden's support comes from politicians running for re-election in safer districts, rather than those who worry Mr Biden could harm their own election chances in tougher seats. Mr Rosenberg said that the White House ""needs to be respectful of their concerns and deal with them, I think, in a far more aggressive manner"". Even as calls grow for Mr Biden to exit the race, the most recent poll seems to suggest that he has not lost much voter support.  The Biden campaign has touted a survey from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos published this week, which shows Mr Biden and Trump in a dead-heat, similar to survey results from before the debate. But the poll also found two-thirds of Americans want Mr Biden to step aside.  Mr Biden has also lost support from some donors, including Democratic fundraiser and actor George Clooney, who wrote a damning op-ed this week calling on Mr Biden to step down.  Other top donors, however, are sticking by the president.  Shekar Narasimhan, who has been organising fundraisers for Democrats for more than two decades, said there had been no change in his plans. ""Our eyes can see what’s going on, our ears can hear what's being talked about but we are keeping our heads down to get the work done,"" said Mr Narsimhan, who is the founder of the Asian American Pacific Islander Victory Fund Super-PAC. ""It's the president’s decision to make, whether he wants to run or not, and we will go with whatever he decides,"" he said. ""But it's better to end this discussion as soon as possible."" He said his support for Mr Biden came from the belief that he would win. ""This election will be decided by no more than a total of 50,000 votes in three states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - and we have the ground game and infrastructure to win there,"" he said. Frank Islam, who sits on the National Finance Committee, said he had a fundraiser planned at his Maryland home later this month. ""I am absolutely going ahead with it because I know he [Mr Biden] will win,"" he said.",2024-07-12 23:09:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4y3xd4r1po,"Madeline Halpert & Brajesh Upadhyay,",2024-07-12 19:09:06,
309,Eminem's The Death of Slim Shady 'a mixed bag',"Guess who's back, back again?  Eminem's latest album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), has been released and is being met with mixed reviews by critics.  In the US rapper's 12th album, his alter ego Slim Shady is killed off - the artwork shows Shady in a body bag, and in the music video for Tobey, Eminem takes a chainsaw to him. Clash called the album ""a mixed bag"" and described it as ""at once an effective piece of fan service, while also being a record that disappoints"". ""It doesn’t quite feel like an ending, but neither does it feel like a continuation,"" Robin Murray wrote. ""A mixed, often muddled album, it features some of Eminem’s best rapping in a decade – those fast, skippy-yet-intricate flows will never fail to thrill – but his pen is often blunted."" Ahead of the release, Eminem told fans this is a ""conceptual album"" and the songs should be listened to in order.  The 19 tracks include previously released singles Tobey and Houdini, as well as a sequel to his 1999 hit Guilty Conscience with Dr Dre.  Billboard ranked the latter song as one of the best on the new album and said ""it’s not the original, but is a worthy second coming"". ""At one point, Slim Shady puts Marshall on blast for creating him as an alter-ego to stir up controversy and essentially be a shield to say jarring things that he didn’t really have the courage to stand on,"" Michael Saponara wrote. USA Today said the 51-year-old is a ""lyrical pugilist throughout, except when he turns misty-eyed dad rapping about daughter Hailie Jade"".  His song Temporary starts with old recordings of the rapper and his daughter talking as a child.  Melissa Ruggieri said it was the most memorable song on the album ""because it gives Eminem permission to drop the shtick and explore his vulnerability – which isn’t often apparent elsewhere on the album"". Eminem calls on his 28-year-old daughter to ""be strong"" and that he will always be her rock. On his track Fuel, Eminem references the multiple sexual assault allegations against fellow rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. ""I'm like an R-A-P-E-R/I got so many S-As/S-As/Wait, he didn't just spell the word rapper and leave out a 'P', did he?"" the lyrics say. Pitchfork said Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers III, ""reckons with his controversies while taking pains to create new one"".  The track Antichrist ""take pains to offend as crudely as possible"" with references to pronouns, woke society and ""the harrowing video of Diddy attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie in a hotel in 2016"". Mr Combs, one of rap's most successful moguls, apologised for his ""inexcusable"" actions shown in that video, and has denied all allegations of sexual assault. A review by the Independent gave the album two stars and said the rapper was ""punching downwards, joylessly and without inspiration"".  ""Much of The Death Of Slim Shady resembles a Telegraph op-ed: the ham-fisted mashing of people’s buttons, the blethering about 'the PC police' and 'Gen Z' coming to get him. Anything to get a reaction,"" Stevie Chick wrote.  ",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn384lg0l37o,"Yasmin Rufo,",2024-07-12 10:09:07,
310,Eight photos that make us question what we see,"""The effect that scares me most is not that we'll be fooled by fake photos but that we'll ignore the real ones"" – how photographers are dealing with shifting perceptions of reality. It seemed unlikely that the Pope would wear a puffer jacket or that Nigel Farage would play Minecraft, but Katy Perry making a big entrance at the Met Gala or Rishi Sunak pouring a bad pint appeared entirely plausible. In fact, all of these images were fake. ""I think it's getting harder to know what is true,"" says Jago Cooper, the director of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich, which is part-way through a six-month series of interlinked exhibitions based around the question What is Truth? It's a theme that's being taken up by a number of museums. In Maastricht, Fotomuseum aan het Vrijthof's Truth is Dead is currently displaying Alison Jackson's amusingly misleading photographs of celebrities, for example; while Foam Amsterdam is exploring how the intersection of art and technology can change our perception of reality with Photography Through the Lens of AI. ""People genuinely want to know how they know what is true in the world today,"" says Cooper. ""Truth is so hard to find and it's a really interesting question."" Unsurprising, then, that it's become a prevalent theme for many contemporary artists, eager to open up conversations about the trustworthiness of visual media. One such artist is the Irish film-maker and photographer Richard Mosse. His photograph Poison Glen (2012) from The Enclave series features in the Sainsbury's Centre's newest exhibition The Camera Never Lies: Challenging images through the Incite Project. The eastern Congolese landscape in the frame ought to appear as green as the Donegal valley it is named for, but by using infrared film, a device normally intended to reveal information, Mosse has instead deceived us. A landscape populated by armed rebels, who are part of a conflict which has cost over 5 million lives, is turned an inviting sugar pink: the nightmare now looks like a fairytale. Also in The Camera Never Lies – which re-evaluates the most iconic images of the past 100 years – is Stuart Franklin's The Tank Man (1989). In the photo, a lone protester in Beijing's Tiananmen Square stands in the path of tanks just minutes after the Chinese authorities gunned down anti-corruption and pro-reform demonstrators. Over time, different truths have been attached to the image – a key part of the exhibition's purpose, exploring how photos have become the memory bank of our lives and how far they are a true reflection of history or merely the images that form our perception of it. Initially, Franklin told Vice in 2020, the captured moment was ""a very useful event politically ... because, in a sense, it was all about restraint. They [the Chinese authorities] didn’t kill him … and it managed to play itself over the top of all the pictures of dead bodies.""  Later, as the collective memory of the massacre faded, it became more expedient to airbrush it out of history. ""In the Western world, it's an iconic image of protest and the dangers of autocracy and the suppression of free speech,"" says Cooper. ""Whereas, within China, you don't see the image at all."" The Emmy award-winning In Event of Moon Disaster (2019), created by American new media artist Halsey Burgund and British digital artist Francesca Panetta, is also on show at the Sainsbury Centre. The film, shown on a vintage TV as part of an immersive installation of a 1960s living room, plays on the many conspiracy theories surrounding the first Moon landing by presenting an alternative version of reality and asking if viewers can spot a deepfake. Some elements are real – the script prepared in case the astronauts on Nasa's Apollo 11 mission in 1969 died, for example – while others, such as the deepfake of President Richard Nixon reading out the script created by synthesising an actor's voice using AI, are not. ""All of the footage we used was real archival footage from Apollo 11,"" the quiz explains at the end. ""However, we used techniques of misinformation to tell a story vastly different from what actually happened."" ""The effect that scares me most is not that we'll be fooled by fake photos but that we'll ignore the real ones, or choose which to believe based on our presumptions,"" Athens-based photographer Maria Mavropoulou tells the BBC. In 2023, interested in how new image-making tools may shift our perception of reality, she used the prompt ""A Self-Portrait of an Algorithm"" to invite AI to introduce itself. The portraits that emerged, some of which are currently on show in Photography through the lens of AI at Amsterdam's Foam Museum, were different every time she asked. AI's identity was shifting − the truth of what it really was, intangible. ""It seems to me that truth is an idea that is sometimes too difficult to pin down and that it is not to be found on the surface of an image,"" she says. For years, Mavropoulou's own portrait was rarely taken, her itinerant childhood leaving much of her early life undocumented. In Imagined Images (2023), she used what she knew about her family history as prompts for text-to-image software and created the family photo album she never had. At first, the photographs seem unremarkable, but looking closely at A five-year-old girl blowing out birthday candles, we see that the children's faces are distorted, a bowl floats off the tablecloth and ""party food"" has become a hybrid of cake and chips. The album's images are made up of what she calls ""statistical truths"" based on typologies, such as ""mother"", ""party"" and ""holiday"", synthesised from a multitude of data sources. Yet though real photo albums have ""no clear intention to lie or deceive"", the story they tell is also unreliable, says Mavropoulou. ""Only happy moments, celebrations and milestones make it in the album, while difficulties, struggles, and loss are left unphotographed."" The in-built biases in AI are also the subject of Where Am I From (Ana Min Wein?) (2022), a short film and visual diary created by New York-based visual artist Nouf Aljowaysir. The work forms part of the Saudi-born artist's exploration into a genealogical journey led by two narrators: the artist and AI. ""Through my mother's beautiful story, I felt belonging,"" she tells the BBC. ""However, as I processed these images through computer vision techniques, this revealed failures in the form of generalisations and stereotypes, uncovering systemically embedded prejudice within commercial AI tools."" Desert scenes were interpreted as military operations, for example, and AI cannot decide if a hijab is ""a poncho"", a ""costume"" or a ""tent"". There's an element of comedy and surprise, but the overall effect is unsettling. ""The film shows how artificial intelligence sees my culture through a simplistic and biased Western lens, reducing my identity, culture and erasing collective ancestral memories,"" she says. BBC Verify With misinformation on the rise, the BBC has launched a brand aimed at countering fake news. BBC Verify is dedicated to examining the facts and claims behind a story to try to determine whether or not it is true, bringing together journalists with a range of forensic investigative skills and open-source intelligence (Osint) capabilities. As well as fact-checking, verifying video, countering disinformation and analysing data, the team transparently shares their evidence-gathering with the audience, explaining complex stories in the pursuit of truth. Reclamation of the Exposition (2020), by British-Nigerian visual artist Tayo Adekunle, exposes the colonial lens behind the 19th-Century ""truth"" about the black female body expressed in the archival images of Prince Roland Napoleon Bonaparte. ""The Bonaparte images were actually taken in the botanical gardens in Paris, and these were South African women who were brought over and put on animal skin [made to pose standing on it] to replicate an exotic environment,"" Adekunle tells the BBC. These staging elements also included removing the women's clothes. Their images became curios for what she describes as ""pseudo-science"" and were distributed as pornographic postcards. ""They perpetuated the idea that black women were more sexual and that people from Africa were savages because they didn't wear clothes,"" says Adekunle. Her decision to place herself in the image and mimic their pose is a gesture of solidarity and a symbol of the timelessness of these mistruths. ""There's a power struggle that happens when you have a photographer and a sitter, and even more so, when that photographer is a white man and the sitter is a black woman,"" she says. ""I didn't want the images, this legacy in the relationship, to feel like it was only existing in the past."" More like this: • How the American Dream came to represent both a utopia and a dystopia • The early Soviet images that foreshadowed fake news • Drowning World: Striking photos of the climate crisis While misrepresentation, as in the case of Bonaparte, can be disturbing, deception is something different in the work of British photographer Alison Jackson more than a century later. In her solo show at the Vrijthof, Royal Selfie appears to show Elizabeth II taking a family snap, while Trump and Money features an open-shirted Donald Trump lookalike with his arms around two women, and is one of several images in the show that play with public perceptions of the US presidential candidate. Such realistic images – placing famous lookalikes in amusing or compromising situations – are a reminder, says the museum, ""that we cannot trust our own eyes when it comes to photography"". Even the best-known faces in the world can fool us. ""The truth is dead,"" Jackson says. ""Nothing we are shown can be trusted; everything can be faked and nothing is authentic."" Jackson's work was initially inspired by the mourning of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales by a public that had never met her, which she felt exposed a tension between perception and reality. Speaking to Euronews in 2020, she said: ""We've got mistaken over what is real and what is not and that is what interests me… We're prepared to go along with a bunch of media narratives – we're all so surface.""

308,"In photos: Kim Kardashian, Bieber and Rihanna at grand India wedding","Celebrities, politicians and popstars from across the globe have arrived in Mumbai for the wedding of youngest son of Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani. Anant Ambani is tying the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of Indian pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant, in a traditional Hindu ceremony in Mumbai city on Friday. The wedding events began with parties and celebrations in March, before the family invited over 800 guests to join them on a cruise around Europe.  But Friday saw the arrival of some of the world's most recognisable faces, as politics, power and celebrity mixed on the red carpet.  Among those who crossed the globe for the events were several prominent political leaders. Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - accompanied by his wife Carrie  - was seen dancing as he entered the venue with one of his young children.  His predecessor, Tony Blair, was also in attendance. He was joined by his wife Cherie. The pair sported traditional Indian attire and arrived just days after Mr Blair's Labour Party returned to power in the UK.  Reality TV star Kim Kardashian documented her arrival on Instagram, travelling with her sister Khloe. She hinted that their journey to the ceremony would be featured in the upcoming season of the Kardashians.  Sporting stars were also in attendance. Indian cricket legend MS Dhoni was accompanied by his family, while Fifa President Gianni Infantino was spotted hitting the red carpet with his wife Leena Al Ashqar. WWE legend John Cena followed soon after, cracking jokes with photographers as he entered the venue.  Bollywood's leading lights also dazzled. Priyanka Chopra arrived in Mumbai with her husband, singer Nick Jonas. The pair were seen grooving on the dance floor, according to Indian media.  Kriti Sanon walked the red carpet in a pink lehenga, while Ananya Panday - who is a bridesmaid - appeared in a tiger-print yellow lehenga embroidered with ""Anant's Brigade"" on the back. The couple's wedding celebrations are likely to continue over several days. Parties have been reportedly planned for Saturday and Sunday and a grand reception is scheduled for Monday.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng8z8mj12o,Unknown,2024-07-12 22:36:07,

307,Children killed in Nigeria school collapse,"A number of children have died and more than 100 others are trapped after a school building collapsed in Nigeria’s central Plateau state, local officials say.  Saint Academy in the state capital Jos caved in while students were in class on Friday morning.  Trapped pupils  were calling for help from under the rubble, AFP reported, with parents frantically searching for their children. The National Emergency Management Agency  (Nema) said ""the exact number of deaths is still being confirmed"". Media reports say at least 17 students were killed. In a post on X, Nema said more than 40 trapped students were rescued and taken to local hospitals. Nigeria's Punch newspaper reported 17 dead while the AFP news agency quoted Red Cross spokesman Nuruddeen Hussain Magaji as saying 21 people were killed. The school is believed to have more than 1,000 pupils. Local resident, Abel Fuandai, told the BBC that his friend's son had been killed and said ""the scale of the tragedy is frightening"". He said rescue workers and emergency officials were racing to save those trapped and using excavators to dig through the rubble. The cause of the collapse is not known but residents said it came after three days of heavy rains in Plateau. Speaking from hospital, injured student Wulliya Ibrahim told AFP: ""I entered the class not more than five minutes, when I heard a sound, and the next thing is I found myself here. ""We are many in the class, we are writing our exams,"" he said. Resident Chika Obioha said he had seen a number of dead bodies and that dozens of people had been rescued. ""Everyone is helping out to see if we can rescue more people,"" he said. There have been several major building collapses in Nigeria in recent years, with observers blaming a mix of bad workmanship, poor quality materials and corruption. In 2021, at least 45 people were killed when a high-rise building under construction collapsed in a wealthy Lagos neighbourhood. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

299,Hackers steal call records of 'nearly all' AT&T customers,"Hackers stole call and text records data from ""nearly all"" of 109 million AT&T Wireless customers, the telecommunications company disclosed on Friday.  The firm said one suspect had been arrested after the records - from May to October 2022 - were illegally downloaded and copied to a third-party platform this April. The stolen data did not contain the content of calls or texts, but did record the numbers contacted, as well as the number and lengths of interactions, the company said. The Justice Department said the delayed announcement of the hack was justified on national security grounds. “We sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care,” AT&T said in a statement. The company said in its filing to the securities and exchange commission it had secured its systems from further similar hacks and did not believe what was stolen was publicly available. It said it first learned of the breach five days after hackers started stealing data on 14 April. They continued to do so until 25 April, the company said. Experts have warned that the information could be used to identify work places, approximate home locations, as well as potential colleagues and friends. The breach comes months after AT&T disclosed  that data from 2019 of 73 million former and current customers had been stolen and placed on the ""dark web"" by fraudsters. AT&T said it would alert affected customers. Users could also log into their account to see if their data was affected, and request a report that would provide a more ""user-friendly"" version showing what was compromised. It warned users to be cautious about email or text requests that ask for personal information.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yemmmg9mo,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-12 18:09:07,
305,Extravagant wedding of India tycoon Ambani’s son in full swing,"After months of lavish celebrations, the wedding ceremony of the son of Asia's richest man is finally under way in the Indian city of Mumbai.   Anant Ambani, son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, is tying the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant. The four-day extravaganza is the final stop in a string of elaborate parties the family has hosted since March, which have featured performances by popstars including Rihanna and Justin Bieber.  Reality TV star Kim Kardashian, and former UK PMs Tony Blair and Boris Johnson, were among the international guests. Also spotted was US wrestler and actor John Cena, who was seen hugging and congratulating relatives of the host. Key roads in Mumbai are being sealed off for several hours a day until the festivities end on Monday. Social media is awash with updates on the wedding, with people sharing minute-by-minute details of Bollywood stars and celebrities arriving. But the extraordinary opulence has also led to backlash - city dwellers have complained the road closures have worsened traffic snarls caused by monsoon flooding, while others have questioned the ostentatious display of wealth at the seemingly never-ending celebrations.  Mukesh Ambani, 66, is at present the world's 10th richest man with a net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes. Reliance Industries, founded by his father in 1966, is a massive conglomerate that operates in sectors ranging from petroleum and retail, to financial services and telecoms. Anant Ambani is the youngest of his three children, all of whom are on the board of Reliance Industries. The 29-year-old is involved in Reliance's energy businesses and is on the board of Reliance Foundation. The Ambanis have not revealed how much this wedding is costing them but wedding planners estimate they've already spent anywhere between 11bn and 13bn rupees [$132m-$156m]. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (£5.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Justin Bieber is $10m. One unnamed executive at Reliance claimed the event was a ""powerful symbol of India's growing stature on the global stage"" in a note shared with reporters. But opposition politician Thomas Isaac said it was ""obscene"". ""Legally it may be their money but such ostentatious expenditure is a sin against mother earth and (the) poor,"" he posted on X. On Friday, the groom set off from his residence in a luxurious red car covered in strings of white flowers, as joyful guests danced around it.  A convoy of cars, also decorated with flowers and carrying family members, followed him with music and cheers.  The grand procession, known as the baraat, culminated at the wedding venue - a  convention centre owned by the Ambanis - where several Bollywood stars joined in another round of singing and dancing. Reports say the bride and groom will exchange garlands to kick off the wedding. The pheras - the main wedding ritual of the couple walking around the sacred fire seven times - is set for 21:30 (1600GMT).  Guests will reportedly bless the newly-weds in a formal ceremony on Saturday - followed by a grand party where unconfirmed reports say pop stars Drake, Lana Del Ray and Adele are likely to perform.  Pictures and videos of Kim Kardashian, who is in the city with her sister Khloé Kardashian, are being widely shared online.  Reports say the sisters have brought a team of stylists, including celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton, along with a group of producers to capture every detail of their trip.   Former Indian president Ram Nath Kovind, British High Commissioner to India Lindy Cameron, and US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti are also in the city to attend the wedding. Rajan Mehra, CEO of air charter company Club One Air, told Reuters that the family had rented three Falcon-2000 jets to ferry wedding guests to the event. “The guests are coming from all over and each aircraft will make multiple trips across the country,” he said.  The wedding festivities began in March when the family held a three-day pre-wedding party in their home state of Gujarat. Among the 1,200 guests to attend that celebration were Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates.  The party started with a performance by Rihanna on the first night. Diljit Dosanjh, the first Punjabi singer to perform at Coachella, took the stage on the second night, while rapper Akon closed the show on the final day of celebrations.  In June, the Ambanis organised another pre-wedding celebration, this time, a luxury cruise from Italy to France. The Backstreet Boys, Katy Perry and Pitbull performed for the 800 guests, which included Bollywood stars and cricketers. Money was also lavished on constructing 14 temples inside a sprawling complex in Jamnagar to showcase India's cultural heritage and provide a backdrop for the wedding. As part of the celebrations, the Ambanis hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples. On Wednesday, the family hosted a bhandara - a community feast for underprivileged people.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x22w0xl0o,"Zoya Mateen & Meryl Sebastian,",2024-07-12 19:09:07,
304,Death and rubble fill streets of Tal Al-Sultan as rescuers dodge Israeli fire,"The things they see. The dead girl lowered by a rope from a ruined building. She sways slightly, then comes to rest, legs folding beneath her on the rubble. They see people and parts of people lying out in the open where the blast or the bullet caught them. Violent death in all of its contortions. Bodies lying in the streets, in the blasted open sitting rooms of houses, under the rubble. Sometimes covered by so much concrete the men will never reach them, and only in the future when the war is over will somebody come and give them a decent burial. The men of the Gaza Civil Defence cannot close their eyes to any of this. There is no shutting out the smell. Every sense is on alert. Death can come from the skies in an instant.  When the fighting in places like Shejaiya in eastern Gaza City, or Tal Al-Sultan, near Rafah, in the south, is as fierce as it has been in the last few days, the ambulances of the Civil Defence dare not venture out. “Entering areas close to the Israeli occupation is dangerous, but we try to intervene to save lives and souls,” says Muhammed Al Mughayer, a local Civil Defence official. He and his men seize any lull in the conflict to recover the dead and the wounded. Families constantly ask about missing relatives. “It is very difficult to identify the bodies,” explains Mr Mughayer. “Some remain unidentified due to complete decomposition.”  Stray animals also prey on the corpses, tearing off clothes and scattering papers that might be used to identify them. The ambulance crews are short of fuel. Two days ago one broke down in Tal Al-Sultan and had to be towed out, a nerve-wracking experience for the crews. The risk of being fired on by the Israeli forces, says Mr Mughayer, means seriously injured people often cannot be rescued. “There is currently a report of an injured person near Al-Salihin Mosque from two days ago, but we can't reach them due to delays in coordination. It may result in their death.” Refugees are continuing to flee from Gaza city and areas like Shejaiya. Many have been displaced multiple times.  For them it is a world without laws or rules. World leaders express concern. But nobody is coming to rescue them. Nothing is more acute for these people than the sense that they can die at any moment. Sharif Abu Shanab stands outside the ruins of his family home in Shejaiya with an expression that is part bewilderment, part grief. ""My house had four floors, and I can't enter it,” he says. “I can't take anything out of it, not even a can of tuna. We have nothing, no food or drink. They bulldozed all the houses, and it is not our fault. Why do they hold us accountable for the fault of others? What did we do? We are citizens. Look at the destruction around you… ""Where do we go, and to whom? We are thrown in the streets now, we have no home or anything, where do we go? There is only one solution and that is to hit us with a nuclear bomb and relieve us of this life."" There are occasional glimpses of reprieve. The Al-Fayoumi family, arriving close to Deir Al Balah in central Gaza, were relieved to have escaped from Gaza City. This after a warning this week to evacuate from the Israel Defense Forces sent thousands of people onto the road south. In the boiling heat of the asphalt road, without shade, family members were reunited with others who had gone ahead of them. The new arrivals were given water and soft drinks. A boy sucked from a carton of juice, then squeezed it with all his strength to coax out a last few drops. Nobody in the group took their survival for granted. So to see everyone alive, all in the one place, brought smiles and cries of happiness. An aunt reached into a car to hug her young niece. At first the child smiled. Then she turned her head and sobbed. Where will they be tomorrow, next week, next month? They have no way of knowing. It depends on where the fighting moves next, on the next Israeli evacuation order, on the mediators and whether Hamas and Israel can agree a ceasefire. These lines could have been written at any time in the last few months. Civilians dying. Taking to the roads. Hunger. Hospitals struggling. Talks about a ceasefire. Since February, we have been following the story of Nawara al-Najjar whose husband Abed-Alrahman was among more than 70 people killed when Israeli forces launched an operation to rescue two hostages in Rafah.  They had fled Khan Younis 9km (6 miles) to the north, and took refuge closer to Rafah when bullets and shrapnel tore through the tented camp where they slept. Nawara was six months pregnant when she was widowed, and taking care of six children, aged from four to 13. When a BBC colleague found her again today, Nawara was nursing her newborn baby, Rahma, just one month old. She gave birth on a night of heavy airstrikes, rushed to the hospital by her in-laws. “I kept saying: ‘Where are you Abed-Alrahman? This is your daughter coming into the world without a father.’"" Baby Rahma has red hair like her dead father. The Israeli advance into Rafah last month sent Nawara and her children fleeing again, back to their old home in Khan Younis. She struggled to settle there again. “My husband's things were there, his laugh, his voice. I couldn’t open the house. I tried to be strong. Then I took my children and opened the door, and we wandered around the house, but it was hard. I cried for my husband…He was the one who cleaned the house, cooked for us, made sure I was comfortable.” There has been fighting around Khan Younis again in the last week. An Israeli air strike close to a school killed 29 people, local hospital sources say, and wounded dozens more.  But Nawara is adamant she will not move again. Here she is close to the memory of the man she loves. She imagines her husband as a still living presence. She sends texts to his phone: “I complain to him, and I cry to him…I try to reassure myself, telling myself that I need to be patient. I imagine he’s the one telling me.” With additional reporting by Haneen Abdeen, Alice Doyard and Nik Millard.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjw6dz8w2eo,"Fergal Keane in Jerusalem,",2024-07-12 16:09:07,
303,US allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato - but is that even possible?,"Only one US president has been at the Nato summit in Washington this week, but the shadow of another - his predecessor - has loomed over this meeting of the world's most powerful military alliance. While the host Joe Biden has presided over a message of unity from the group's 32 members, the Nato-sceptic views of his rival for power, Donald Trump, have imbued conversations here with an urgency and an anxiety. At times the smiles from world leaders in the conference hall have felt fragile. Trump “hangs over every conversation here"", said one Eastern European diplomat who asked to remain nameless.  The Republican's election as president in November ""could change everything”, the diplomat said. The fact that Mr Biden has been trying to fend off a political crisis over his frailty has only sharpened the sense that a second Trump term could bring far-reaching changes to an alliance forged in the ashes of the World War Two and still reliant on hard US military power to deter adversaries. So does Nato need to “Trump-proof” itself - as some describe it -  and if so, is it possible?  There is a lot of evidence of efforts by Nato allies to reach out already to those in  Trump’s political orbit to try to manage relationships and limit what they would see as the potential damage of a second term. But others suggest something more unmanageable. Camille Grand, a French former official who was one of Nato’s deputy leaders throughout the Trump administration, described himself as “much more worried” than colleagues who think a second term may be “Trump [term] one on steroids” but ultimately workable for the alliance.  “He doesn't have the same sort of guardrails, he doesn't have the same sort of adults in the room. And he has around him a team that is trying to turn his instinct into policy,” said Mr Grand, who is now a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.  Four members of visiting delegations, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC their concern was not necessarily that a Trump administration would withdraw entirely from Nato, as he has threatened before. Rather it is a fear that the US commitment to the alliance's core principle of collective security - ""all for one and one for all"", meaning any ally under attack can expect defence from the others - could wane. Trump’s positions on Nato have veered erratically from outright hostility - portraying the alliance as a bunch of freeloading Europeans surviving off protection paid for by US taxpayers - to suggesting his outbursts are simply part of a cunning negotiating tactic to compel more of Nato’s members to meet its defence spending targets.  He has frequently tried to rally crowds of supporters with attacks on the organisation. As the summit began, he posted to his Truth Social network that when he started as president most Nato members were “delinquent” until they “paid up” due to his pressure.   By the end of Trump’s presidency, four more Nato countries had hit the alliance’s guidelines of spending at least 2% of national income on defence. So far during President Biden’s term, another 13 countries have reached the target. That progress is frequently touted by the Biden administration and its backers, although in reality much of the increase was triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At a February campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to Nato countries that did not spend enough.  That sparked outrage from some quarters in Washington, but privately his threats are said to have gone further.  At a panel event in January,  European Union commissioner Thierry Breton  described a meeting he had attended in 2020 between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  “Donald Trump said to Ursula: ‘You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you. And by the way, Nato is dead. And we will leave, we will quit Nato.’  ""It was the president of the United States of America,” recalled Mr Breton. “He may come back.""    Trump’s campaign has been approached by the BBC with a request to confirm whether the account was accurate. Evelyn Farkas, a former senior official at the Pentagon in the Obama administration, believes there remains a real concern even over Nato’s existence under Mr Trump.  “I think there is a danger with Trump that he tries to pull us out of Nato. I won't sugarcoat that,” said Dr Farkas, now executive director at public policy think tank the McCain Institute.  “The reality is Trump is dangerous to the alliance in that America is still the strongest economic, political, military power and Nato is stronger if Nato has the United States inside the alliance."" But one of those familiar with the thinking in Trump’s political orbit, Dan Caldwell from the right-wing think tank Defence Priorities, believes the former president's priority is to push European nations to invest more in their own militaries.  “I don't think he wants to withdraw from Nato, but he has said that the United States should re-evaluate its role and the purpose of Nato going forward,” he said.  “Not only the former president but more and more national security experts on the right believe the United States has really no choice but to do less in Europe. So I think that there's some larger forces at play, that will eventually force the next president, regardless of who it is… to substantially pull back from Nato."" The most detailed account of policy positions that might influence a second Trump term comes from an initiative being brought up by supporters and detractors of Trump alike. Overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation, “Project 2025” is a 900-page detailed blueprint for a Republican president to usher in a sweeping overhaul of the executive branch.  The initiative says a future president should “transform Nato” so that America’s role is primarily for its nuclear deterrent, while other members should field “the great majority” of conventional forces required to deter Russia.  This is in keeping with the project’s foreign policy position, seeing the main threat to US primacy as China and therefore calling for the next president to “bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions” sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  Trump himself has equivocated over the war but has said he would end it in “24 hours”. He favours brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine on terms that many Nato allies would see as surrender for Kyiv.  Trump has partially disavowed Project 2025, saying he does not know who is behind it but many of his former officials had a hand in writing it, including a former acting defense secretary.  Since Trump left office, the increase in the number of Nato members spending at least 2% of their income on defence has better insulated the alliance for the future, said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Asked about ""Trump-proofing"", he said Congress had also moved to shield America's membership of Nato from the whims of the White House, in a law passed last year. “We clarified no president can unilaterally withdraw from Nato without a vote of approval from the Senate,” Mr Coons told the BBC.  He also highlighted the $60bn military assistance package for Ukraine finally passed in April in a bipartisan effort following nine months of paralysis, after allies of Trump blocked passage of the bill through Congress.  ""It is my hope that we will continue to be a counterweight and a counterbalance to the president should we, I think, make the tragic mistake of moving forward with a second Trump term.” But Trump has repeatedly challenged current levels of US military provision for Ukraine, again arguing he could negotiate the war’s end with Russia.  Another possible attempt to future-proof US support for Ukraine is by moving more co-ordination for arms supply to Nato itself - taking it further out of reach of a future American president. Such a move has been pitched by Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as a way to ""shield"" Ukraine's supply of aid “against the winds of political change"", officials told The Financial Times.  At the summit the alliance agreed to launch a new program in which Nato will supplement, but not replace, a 50-nation “contact group” that co-ordinates delivery of weapons. Camille Grand, the former Nato official, thinks the summit may have “raised the cost” for a future President Trump to roll back the ""messaging” from Nato, but in the end, he said, Trump-proofing was impossible.  “If the US, as the biggest shareholder in the alliance, decides to be tough on the alliance, on Ukraine, there is no nothing in the [summit agreement] and previous summits that prevent it from doing that.  “But I think it's sending an important message to Trump and his team, which is that the Europeans have turned the corner when it comes to [increased] spending.” Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský reiterated that, telling me that any future president of the US that wanted to change things on Nato had the power to do so.  The real work of “Trump-proofing” at this summit has instead felt like Nato supporters pitching the alliance to conservative Americans to try to change their view. This found its most striking moment when President Zelensky appeared at the Reagan Institute for an on-stage conversation with Fox News host Bret Baier.  Mr Zelensky repeatedly raised the memory of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan, quoting Cold War lines on deterring enemies through working with allies.   Reagan is a favoured reference for Democrats trying to expose Republican divisions and what they see as the maverick isolationism of Trump. The subtext is: Reagan would turn in his grave at Trump’s Nato-sceptic stance. But it's a message that may fall flat with those who Mr Zelensky thinks need to hear it.

302,Poland considers downing Russian missiles over Ukraine,"Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has said Warsaw is considering a proposal from Kyiv to shoot down Russian missiles heading towards Polish territory while they are still in Ukrainian airspace. The proposal was included in a joint defence agreement between the two countries signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Warsaw earlier this week. ""At this stage, this is an idea. What our agreement said is we will explore this idea,” Mr Sikorski told the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. He said some Russian missiles fired from the St Petersburg area towards Ukrainian targets near the western city of Lviv, not far from the Polish border, traversed Belarus and entered Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before turning towards their targets in Ukraine. Mr Sikorski acknowledged that such a short time gave Poland little time to react. However the proposal would theoretically cover any missile traversing western Ukraine in the direction of Poland. “We are a frontline state and Russian missiles breach our airspace. We assume by mistake,"" Mr Sikorski said. “Our dilemma is the following. If we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property.  ""And the Ukrainians are saying, ‘Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they’re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory.  ""To my mind, that’s self-defence but we are exploring the idea,” Mr Sikorski said. Mr Sikorski said an unarmed Russian missile landed near his home in Bydgoszcz about 500km (311 miles) from the Belarusian border, without harming anyone, in December 2022. Two Polish citizens had been killed by falling debris when Ukraine shot down a Russian missile near the Polish border a month earlier. Earlier this week, Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would consult with its Nato allies and seek their agreement before attempting to shoot down any Russian missiles. “If there would be such a decision, it can only be an allied decision. It will never be an individual decision,” Mr Kosiniak-Kamysz told Poland's TVN broadcaster at a Nato summit in Washington DC.  ""The key opinion is the United States, who is quite sceptical in this matter, so Poland will certainly not make such a decision on its own,” he added. Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polityka Insight, told the BBC the idea could prove perilous for Poland. “Without robust allied support, which there isn’t, this proposal is very risky,"" he said. ""From the point of view of our air defence assets and the fact we might be subject to some kind of Russian response.” Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Poland has provided Ukraine with 44 packages of weapons and ammunition, including more than 250 tanks, MiG-29 fighter jets, combat helicopters, artillery systems and portable air defence missile systems worth more than €4bn ($4.4bn; £3.4bn). Poland plans to provide additional military assistance to Ukraine this year.",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09234xxn1o,"Adam Easton,",2024-07-12 17:09:07,
301,Alec Baldwin's Rust trial dismissed amid claims of hidden evidence,"Alec Baldwin broke into tears as a New Mexico judge dismissed manslaughter charges over the shooting death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of his film Rust. The dismissal came three days into Baldwin's trial in Santa Fe, at a court just miles from the Western film set where Ms Hutchins, a cinematographer, was shot with a revolver Mr Baldwin was using in rehearsals.  His lawyers alleged police hid evidence of the source of the live round that killed her. It is the second time the case against the actor has been dismissed since the October 2021 shooting.  A key aspect of the case has been how live ammunition ended up on the film set and Mr Baldwin’s lawyers have questioned the investigation and mistakes made by authorities who processed the scene. The motion set off a remarkable set of events with one of the two special prosecutors leading the case resigning, and Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissing the jury so she could hear from multiple witnesses.  The bullets, Mr Baldwin's lawyer said, could be related to Hutchins' death but were filed in a different case with a different number.  Prosecutors argued the ammunition was not connected to the case and did not match bullets found on the Rust set. Mr Baldwin broke into tears as the judge read from a lengthy statement detailing her reasons for the dismissal. His wife, Hilaria, covered his mouth. Other members of his family cried and smiled. Judge Sommer said that even if this evidence was not critical or relevant to the case, it is required that it should have been given to the defence. ""The state's wilful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate,"" she said from the bench. ""There is no way for the court to right this wrong."" The evidence came to light on Thursday, when a crime-scene technician said in evidence that a man named Troy Teske, a retired police officer, had turned over live ammunition that could be related to the case.  Mr Teske is friends with the step-father of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year.  He was working with Seth Kenney, who helped with props on the film set.  In 2023, prosecutors in the case dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Mr Baldwin, saying they had new evidence and needed more time to investigate. They refiled that charge in January. This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly. Please refresh the page for the fullest version.

306,German shock at reported Russian assassination plot,"German political figures have reacted angrily to a report that Russia had plotted to kill the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall, Armin Papperger. The CNN report said US officials had told their counterparts in Berlin earlier this year and security around him was stepped up. Germany's interior ministry refused to comment but Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock appeared to confirm the details. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months,"" she told reporters at the Nato summit in Washington. ""Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression."" In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations. ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously."" Rheinmetall avoided commenting on issues of ""corporate security"", but Mr Papperger is now being described as the most highly protected figure in Germany's economy. He told the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"". The company is one of the world's biggest producers of ammunition and has become key to supplying Ukraine with arms, armoured vehicles and other military equipment. Rheinmetall recently opened a tank repair plant in western Ukraine. Last month, it signed an agreement with Ukraine to expand co-operation in the coming years, including a joint venture to produce artillery shells. Mr Papperger said at the time his company wanted to hand over the first Lynx infantry fighting vehicles later this year and to start producing them in Ukraine soon. Although Chancellor Olaf Scholz avoided commenting on the reported assassination plot directly, he said it was well known that Germany was exposed to a variety of Russian threats and was paying close attention to them. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said ""we are taking very seriously the significantly heightened threat of Russian aggression"". Earlier this week, a senior Nato official told the BBC that Russia was ""engaging in aggressive covert operations across Europe – involving sabotage, arson and assassination plots – aimed at weakening public support for Ukraine"". The German foreign minister said the Baltic states had already highlighted the various methods deployed by Russia's Vladimir Putin in his war on Ukraine. As well as sabotage, she spoke of cyberattacks and disrupting GPS signals so that Baltic flights could no longer land in neighbouring countries. ""We have seen that there have been attacks on factories, and that again underlines that, together, we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,"" Ms Baerbock told reporters. In early May, a building complex owned by the Diehl Metall firm went up in flames in south-west Berlin. Although a technical fault was blamed for the fire, sabotage has not been ruled out. Suspicious fires have also been reported in Poland and Lithuania. Last April, Mr Papperger's garden house was set alight at Hermannsburg in northern Germany, although there has been no evidence of a Russian link. The fire was quickly brought under control and a rambling, anonymous confession purportedly from leftist militants appeared on activist network Indymedia.  The reported plot against such a high-profile German CEO has prompted widespread alarm. Leading conservative figure Roderich Kiesewetter said the chancellor should come clean with the German population about how great the threat from Russia really was. German intelligence needed to be boosted to the level of neighbouring countries, he said. ""We must take it very seriously and also prepare ourselves accordingly,"" he told public broadcaster ZDF. Michael Roth, who chairs Germany's foreign affairs committee told Bild newspaper that Vladimir Putin was waging a ""war of extermination not only against Ukraine, but against its supporters and our values"".  The head of the defence committee, Marcus Faber, added his condemnation, saying if information about Russian intelligence involvement came to light, then ""the expulsion of diplomats must follow and, if necessary, international arrest warrants must be issued"".",2024-07-12 23:09:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wej84e9l7o,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-12 12:09:07,
322,Australian soldier charged with spying for Russia,"An Australian soldier and her husband have been arrested and each charged with spying for Russia. Investigators say the couple - both Russian-born Australian citizens - obtained Australian Defence Force (ADF) material to share with Moscow. However, Australian police say ""no significant compromise"" of military secrets has been identified. It is the first time stricter foreign interference laws - introduced by Australia in 2018 - have been used to lay espionage charges. Kira Korolev, a 40-year-old army private, and her 62-year-old husband Igor Korolev faced court in Brisbane on Friday, each on one count of preparing for an espionage offence – which carries a maximum 15-year jail sentence. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been ""briefed extensively"" by the nation's security agencies but would not comment on the case directly as it is now before the courts. Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the couple had been in Australia for more than a decade before the alleged offending and had both become citizens several years ago. Igor worked as a self-employed labourer, and Kira was an information systems technician in the army, a role for which she had obtained a security clearance, police say. Mr Kershaw alleged she secretly travelled to Russia while on leave from the ADF, then instructed Igor to access her work account and send sensitive material so that she could forward it on to Russian authorities. An investigation in to whether any of the material was ever delivered to them is still underway, Mr Kershaw said, adding that the charges could be upgraded. Both Mr Kershaw and Australia's spy agency boss Mike Burgess – who addressed media together on Friday - declined to answer questions about the nature of the documents or how authorities were tipped off about the alleged crimes. But Mr Burgess said that the ongoing threat of espionage is ""real"". ""Multiple countries are seeking to steal Australia's secrets. We cannot be naive, and we cannot be complacent."" ""If you are spying in this country, we are looking for you. If you are being spied on in this country, we are looking out for you,"" he added. Mr Kershaw stressed that Australia's allies could be ""confident"" that the country would ""continue to identify and disrupt espionage and foreign interference activity"". In a statement, the ADF said it was aware one of its members had been arrested and that it ""takes all breaches of security seriously"".",2024-07-12 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yl3pvl1xo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-12 04:09:08,
321,Kenya's police chief resigns after deadly anti-tax protests,"Kenya's police chief Japhet Koome has resigned, following weeks of violent protests against proposed tax hikes in which more than 40 people died. Human rights groups have accused police of shooting dozens of protestors, some of them fatally, and abducting or arbitrarily arresting hundreds more. The resignation comes a day after President William Ruto sacked most of his cabinet, following pressure from the protest movement which is largely coordinated online by young Kenyans. Two weeks ago protesters stormed parliament, shortly after legislators passed the controversial finance bill. Police responded by opening fire on demonstrators in the streets. President Ruto later withdrew the bill but that has failed to satisfy the demonstrators, who want him to step down and are planning more protests to demand further reforms. Deputy police chief Douglas Kanja takes over running the force with immediate effect, the Kenyan presidency has said. Mr Koome's resignation has been welcomed by Kenyans, yet police officers who caught on film firing at protesters remain at large. Last week during an unprecedented discussion on X, formerly Twitter, President Ruto promised Kenyans he would take action against those police officers once he received video evidence. It is not clear whether this has happened. On Friday at least 11 dead bodies, some of them dismembered, were found at a rubbish tip in the capital, Nairobi, after residents raised the alarm. It is not yet clear whether their deaths have any connection with the protests. In the midst of the biggest crisis of his two-year presidency, Mr Ruto earlier this week met opposition leader Raila Odinga and announced plans to form a 150-member dialogue panel to help find a solution to the country's problems. After sacking key cabinet members on Thursday including the attorney-general, the  president said he would now consult widely in order to set up a broad-based government. The proposed tax measures were intended to help ease the country's debt burden of over $80bn (£63bn). About 60% of Kenya’s collected revenues goes to servicing debt. But protesters have insisted the government should first cut spending, saying there was too much waste and corruption. In response to this demand, the presidency last week announced a number of austerity measures. Additional reporting by Natasha Booty Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

320,Titanic mission to map wreck in greatest-ever detail,"A team of imaging experts, scientists and historians set sail for the Titanic on Friday to gather the most detailed photographic record ever made of the wreck. The BBC had exclusive access to expedition members in the US city of Providence, Rhode Island, as they made preparations to leave port. They'll be using state of the art technology to scan every nook and cranny of the famous liner to gain new insights into its sinking. This is the first commercial mission to Titanic since last year's OceanGate tragedy. Five men died while trying to visit the lost ship in a novel submersible. A joint memorial service will be held at sea in the coming days for them and the 1,500 passengers and crew who went down with Titanic in 1912. The new expedition is being mounted by the US company that has sole salvage rights and which to date has brought up some 5,500 objects from the wreck. But this latest visit is purely a reconnaissance mission, says RMS Titanic Inc, based in Atlanta, Georgia. Two robotic vehicles will dive to the ocean bottom to capture millions of high-resolution photographs and to make a 3D model of all the debris. ""We want to see the wreck with a clarity and precision that's never before been achieved,"" explained co-expedition lead David Gallo. The logistics ship Dino Chouest is going to be the base for operations out in the North Atlantic. Weather permitting, it should spend 20 days above the wreck, which lies in 3,800m (12,500ft) of water. It will be a poignant few weeks for all involved. One of the five who died on the OceanGate sub was Frenchman Paul-Henri (""PH"") Nargeolet. He was the director of research at RMS Titanic Inc and was due to lead this expedition. A plaque will be laid on the seabed in his honour. ""It's tough but the thing about exploration is that there's an urge and a drive to keep going. And we're doing that because of that passion PH had for continuous exploration,"" explained friend and historian Rory Golden, who will be ""chief morale officer"" on Dino Chouest. There can be few people on Earth who don't know the story of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic and how it was holed by an iceberg, east of Canada, on the night of 15 April 1912. There are countless books, movies and documentaries about the event. But although the wreck site has been the target of repeated study since its discovery in 1985, there still isn't what could be described as a definitive map. And while the bow and stern sections of the broken ship are reasonably well understood, there are extensive areas of the surrounding debris field that have received only cursory inspection. Two six-tonne remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) intend to put that right. One will be fitted with an array of ultra-high-definition optical cameras and a special lighting system; the other will carry a sensor package that includes a lidar (laser) scanner. Together, they'll track back and forth across a 1.3km-by-0.97km section of seafloor. Evan Kovacs, who's in charge of the imaging programme, says his camera systems should produce millimetre resolution. ""If all of the weather gods, the computer gods, the ROV gods, the camera gods -  if all those gods align, we should be able to capture Titanic and the wreck site in as close to digital perfection as you can get. You would be able to quite literally count grains of sand,"" he told BBC News. There's huge anticipation for what the magnetometer aboard the sensor ROV might produce. This is a first for Titanic. The instrument will detect all the metals at the wreck site, even material that is buried out of sight in the sediment. ""It would be an absolute dream to determine what has happened with Titanic's bow below the seafloor,"" explained geophysics engineer Alison Proctor. ""Hopefully, we'll be able to deduce whether or not the bow was crushed when it hit the seabed, or if it might actually extend down well into the sediment intact."" The team wants to review the state of some well known objects in the debris field, such as the boilers that spilled out as the opulent steamliner broke in half. There's the desire, too, to locate items thought to have been sighted on previous visits. These include an electric candelabra, which in its day would have been a fascinating curio, as well as the possibility of a second Steinway grand piano. The musical instrument's wooden surround would have long since decayed away, but the cast iron plate, or frame, that held the strings should still be there, perhaps even some of the keys. ""For me, it's the passengers' possessions, especially their bags, that are of greatest interest,"" said Tomasina Ray, who curates the collection of Titanic artefacts held by the company. ""It's their belongings - if we are able to retrieve more in the future - that help flesh out their stories. For so many passengers, they are just names on a list, and it's a way to keep them meaningful."" This will be RMS Titanic Inc's ninth visit to the wreck site. The firm has attracted controversy in recent years with its stated desire to try to bring up part of the Marconi radio equipment that transmitted the distress calls on the night of the sinking. It won't happen on this expedition but if and when it does occur, it would mean extracting an object from inside the disintegrating ship. For many, Titanic is the gravesite to the 1,500 who died that night in 1912 and should not be touched, its interior especially. ""We get that and understand it,"" said company researcher James Penca. ""We dive to Titanic to learn as much as we can from her; and like you should with any archaeological site, we do it with the utmost respect. But to leave her alone, to just let her passengers and crew be lost to history - that would be the biggest tragedy of all.""

317,The three-way international tussle for Euro 24 star Lamine Yamal,"The teenage sensation has shone at the Euros Lamine Yamal's peformance at the ongoing European Championships is set to boost football in Equatorial Guinea, says the country’s football federation. The 16-year-old, who has stunned the world with his displays in Germany, plays for Spain despite having an Equatoguinean mother and a Moroccan father. He was born in Barcelona, where he grew up and is coming through La Masia academy for the five-time European champions, with whom he recently concluded his first season of action. ""Even though Lamine is not playing for Equatorial Guinea, we hold him very close in our hearts and think he is going to do many things for Equatoguinean football,"" Venancio Tomas Ndong Micha, the country’s football federation president, told BBC Sport Africa. ""We are enjoying his extraordinary performances at the Euros, on top of the great season with FC Barcelona. ""He has our roots, and this shows that we are a country of good footballers,"" added Ndong Micha. Entrusted with dead-ball situations for a major European football nation despite his tender age, Yamal has shown his all-around ability with his stunning goal against France and assists in the games against Croatia, Georgia and Germany. He is set to play the final against England on Sunday, a day after he turns 17, making him the youngest player to contest a final at either the Euros or World Cup. Pele is the youngest to play in a World Cup Final. He was 17 years 249 days when he played in Brazil's 5-2 triumph over Sweden in the 1958  final, when he scored twice. Yamal's record as the youngest goal scorer at a Euros (aged 16 years 361 days) will be very hard to beat. As will his feats at Barcelona – for whom he is the youngest player to start a league game (16 years and 38 days) – and in La Liga, where he is the youngest scorer in history (16 years and 87 days).  Equatorial Guinea is a country split into two parts, with the capital Malabo located on one of its island areas while the largest city on its African mainland section is Bata, where Yamal’s mother was born. She eventually found her way to Spain where she was working as a waitress when she met his father, from whom she has since separated. While his mother and grandmother live in Barcelona, the rest of Yamal’s maternal family are still in Equatorial Guinea, a country which has reached the knock-out stages at the last two Africa Cup of Nations despite its small stature. Three years ago, Equatorial Guinea’s football federation (Feguifoot) tried to secure the winger’s services for the team currently ranked 89th by Fifa, only to discover they were far behind Spain, who play England in Sunday’s European Championship final. ""We contacted the family in 2021 but the advances with the Spanish football federation had gone very deep,"" Ndong Micha explained. ""But we did try, because I am a good friend of the family by chance – particularly the grandfather – and all the family used to talk about the kid. ""Then, there were also the Moroccans who went after him... but the Spanish beat us."" Faouzi Lekjaa, the president of Morocco’s football federation, has explained how their attempts to secure Yamal last year ended in defeat, given the teenager's firm desire to play for Spain. Nonetheless, both African countries remain close to Yamal’s heart – as can be seen by the presence of their respective national flags on the football boots his feet dazzle in. “This shows that even though he is playing for Spain, he is not forgetting his Equatoguinean roots,” added Ndong Micha. His boots nod to his parents' home countries - Morocco and Equatorial Guinea Ndong Micha believes that Yamal is placing his mother’s nation firmly in the global spotlight, saying it echoes Ansu Fati’s breakthrough at an early age, also at Barcelona, when people learnt about his family’s country Guinea-Bissau. ""His performances – coupled with those in the Barca first team – show that Equatorial Guinea has an extraordinarily different way of playing to most African countries,"" argues Ndong Micha. ""Given his talent, and his roots, we could one day have more players like Lamine here."" Yamal is not the first Spain-based player with Equatoguinean roots to hit the headlines this year, after Emilio Nsue stunned global observers when finishing top scorer at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations aged 34. Far less welcome global headlines followed last month, when Fifa ruled that the striker had never been declared eligible to play for Equatorial Guinea, for whom he is top scorer with 22 goals. Nonetheless, his goals helped the ""National Thunder"" reach the final 16. The nation of under two million people has reached the knock-out phase at all four Afcons they have contested. ""We have to continue preparing well,"" says Ndong Micha. ""The government will soon invest in football academies so that we can unearth more Lamines and Emilios in future. It is prepared to keep investing as it has in recent years to continue searching for natural talent from Equatorial Guinea, but particularly in the country itself. ""Prior to my arrival, we had never qualified for a Nations Cup on our own merits – only as a host nation (twice) – but we have now qualified twice for Afcon outright (in 2021 and 2023). ""On a sporting level, with Fifa, the Confederation of African Football, and our government we are going to keep growing football-wise so that in the next few years, Equatorial Guinea will be the model of a small country but a big giant-killer.” If Ndong Micha gets his way and the tiny central African nation secures a historic first World Cup qualification, there is even a chance that Yamal could face his mother’s nation on the biggest stage one day. Equatorial Guinea may be small but it punches well above its weight in football",2024-07-12 23:09:08,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn07d8g16xno,Piers Edwards,2024-07-12 23:09:08,
339,Djokovic sets up Alcaraz rematch in Wimbledon final,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2024: Djokovic beats Musetti in straight sets to make tenth Wimbledon final Novak Djokovic outclassed Italian underdog Lorenzo Musetti to reach the Wimbledon final and set up a showdown with reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in a repeat of last year's final. The 37-year-old impressed as he stayed on course for a record-equalling eighth men's singles title at Wimbledon with a 6-4 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 victory on Centre Court. Musetti, 22, had one chance to get the break back in the final set but sent a forehand into the net and crouched down with his head in his hands, knowing the end was near. Djokovic made sure his opponent did not get another opportunity.  Under pressure, Musetti sent a shot long before Djokovic walked to the net, knowing he had reached his 37th Grand Slam final and 10th at Wimbledon. The Serb then moved his racquet over his shoulder and imitated playing a violin, in a gesture aimed at his six-year-old daughter Tara, with television cameras showing her grinning along. Some fans, however, started booing, thinking Djokovic, who produced the same celebration following his win over Holger Rune in the last 16, was being disrespectful. Alcaraz beat Djokovic in last year's showpiece, winning 1-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 3-6 6-4 in a five-set epic, which lasted four hours 42 minutes and is regarded one of the best matches in the tournament's history. The pair meet again on Sunday in what could be another amazing chapter in Wimbledon folklore. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2024: Crowd boos as Djokovic performs violin celebration after win Asked about Spaniard Alcaraz, Djokovic said: ""He's a great example of a player that has an all-round balance, he has a great team around him, great values, a lot of charisma and carries himself superbly - that's one of the reasons why is so popular. ""He's one of the greatest 21-year-olds we've ever seen and we're going to see a lot of him in the future, no doubt. He's going to win many Grand Slams, but hopefully not in two days. He can do it when I retire."" Djokovic, 16 years older than Alcaraz, added: ""He already beat me here in a Wimbledon final in a five-set thriller so I don't expect anything less than a huge battle. ""He is as complete a player as they come, so it's going to take the best of my ability to beat him."" Novak Djokovic is trying to match Roger Federer's total of eight Wimbledon titles Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slam titles, but this one would surely be the most remarkable of them all. The Serb had to withdraw from May's French Open before his quarter-final after suffering a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. Djokovic underwent surgery in early June and his participation in this tournament was in doubt. Yet now he is one match away from not only equalling Roger Federer's tally of eight Wimbledon titles, but also surpassing Margaret Court's total of 24 Grand Slam championships. ""There was plenty of doubt,"" admitted Djokovic. ""I came into London eight days before the tournament started. I didn’t know [if I would play] and was keeping everything open until the day of the draw. ""I played a couple of practice sets with top players and that proved to me I was in a good enough state to not just be in Wimbledon, but to go deep into the tournament."" Djokovic was playing for the first time since Monday when he beat Denmark's Rune in the last 16, but then accused some of the fans of disrespecting him. Some supporters were chanting the Dane's name, but stretching the start of it, with Djokovic saying it was used as an opportunity to boo him. There had been fears the same thing might happen again, using Musetti's name. But the match was largely played amid a wonderful atmosphere with both players receiving plenty of support and applause when merited. There threatened to be a flashpoint in the third set when a point was challenged, with Djokovic unhappy, and a delay to the action led to boos from a few fans. But the situation was soon dealt with, before Djokovic glared at a spectator who called out when he was playing a shot shortly after he had failed to take a match point. Again, the tension quickly passed as the match was played to a conclusion. Musetti, who had won a five-set quarter-final against 13th seed Taylor Fritz, had produced his best run in a Slam and gave everything against Djokovic, who gained the first key break in the sixth game. Unlike against Rune, Djokovic largely did not get involved in the crowd, although Musetti gained an instant break in the second set - a leaping, spinning overhead smash also brought sporting applause from Djokovic. The same happened following a glorious cross-court Musetti winner, but once the Serb won the tie-break, there looked no way back for his opponent. So it proved, with Djokovic breaking early in the third set on his way to yet another final as Musetti was unable to follow in the footsteps of fellow Italian Jasmine Paolini, who plays Barbora Krejcikova in Saturday's women's final. ""Nole played a really incredible match,"" said Musetti. ""He showed he's in great shape - not only in tennis. His tennis fits very well on this surface, it was a joke at the end how he was returning.""

338,England reaching Euros final feels 'normal' - Southgate,"This video can not be played Euro 2024: Reaching final 'feels a little bit more normal' for England - Southgate Gareth Southgate says England felt ""perhaps less satisfaction"" at reaching the Euro 2024 final compared to their Euro 2020 experience. The Three Lions' 2-1 victory against the Netherlands on Wednesday set them up for a second consecutive European Championship final. England finished runners-up at the delayed Euros in 2021, losing 3-2 to Italy in a penalty shootout at Wembley following a 1-1 draw. That was the men's first final appearance since the 1966 World Cup, and now another awaits them on Sunday when Spain will provide the opposition. Southgate has guided England to the semi-finals or further in three of his four major tournaments in charge - World Cups and Euros - without yet winning a trophy. Including fixtures decided on penalty shootouts, Southgate's England have won nine knockout games and lost three, also losing a third-place game. ""There's a different feel [than 2021]. We're now in a different moment as a team, two tournaments on and a lot more big match experience,"" Southgate told BBC Sport. ""I guess there was less of a celebration, perhaps less satisfaction at reaching a final. ""I wouldn't say it becomes run of the mill but it's a little bit more normal for us. That statement in itself is probably a bit ridiculous given our history."" When asked if that meant that winning was now essential, Southgate said, “Yeah, we needed to win the last one! We didn’t. What we do know is that in the end, how we’ll be viewed by others will be determined by the result on Sunday” England have to be 'perfect' to beat Spain - Southgate  We don't care how we win, says England's Watkins Penalties, red cards and shocks - England's 58 years of hurt After being named the Football Association's head of elite development in 2012, Southgate was appointed England's Under-21 manager a year later. He replaced Sam Allardyce as manager of the senior team in 2016. ""What that journey's taught me is what it means to English football really to have credibility on the European and world stage,"" said Southgate. ""I know what it means to people working at every level from youth development all the way through to senior football."" Southgate's England deal, which he extended in November 2021, is due to expire in December. The 53-year-old said he would not be discussing his future before Sunday's final. ""Emotionally it would be impossible for me to make a logical decision at the moment on any of that because my sole focus for two years has been winning this tournament,"" said Southgate. ""The last five or six weeks have been an absolute rollercoaster, so I don't really know where I am with anything other than very focused on preparing the team for this game and determined to keep leading them in the way we have over the last month.""

337,Paolini faces Krejcikova in unexpected final showdown,"Barbora Krejcikova (right) beat Jasmine Paolini in the pair's only previous meeting in the first round of Australian Open qualifying in 2018  Wimbledon 2024: Women's singles final (14:00 BST) Coverage: Watch live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 13:15 BST, listen on Radio 5 Live and follow live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app. A new women's champion will be crowned at Wimbledon on Saturday when surprise finalists Jasmine Paolini and Barbora Krejcikova face each other in an intriguing encounter. Paolini is vying to become Italy's first Wimbledon singles champion, while her opponent is hoping to continue the Czech Republic's proud record in the championships. At 5ft 4in tall, Paolini would also be the shortest Grand Slam singles champion in the Open era, having never tasted victory in a main tour match on grass until this summer. Krejcikova had only won three matches in five months before the tournament after struggling with illness and injury. The two 28-year-olds have taken advantage of an open women's draw and are now one match away from lifting the famous Venus Rosewater Dish. Whoever wins on Saturday, it is also guaranteed there will be a first-time Wimbledon champion for the seventh year in a row. This video can not be played Paolini beats Vekic in semi-final thriller Paolini, the first Italian woman to reach a Wimbledon final in the Open era, had lost in the opening round at SW19 in each of her three previous appearances. But she has made up for lost time this fortnight and picked up new fans along the way with her athleticism and warm personality, even admitting after one match that she found time to do her nails before her semi-final. Too scared to admit ""winning Wimbledon was one of her dreams"" until this week, her remarkable run was kickstarted at the French Open six weeks ago.  Paolini went beyond the third round of a major for the first time and eventually made it all the way to the final, losing to world number one Iga Swiatek. At Wimbledon, the seventh seed has continued her fantastic form, storming to victory in her first three matches before her fourth round match against Madison Keys was ended abruptly by injury to the American. Paolini took just 58 minutes to breeze past Emma Navarro in the quarter-finals and followed that up with an astonishing, record-breaking semi-final win over Donna Vekic. Six-time singles champion Billie Jean King praised her shot-making afterwards, with 2021 champion Ash Barty remarking there is ""no ball she doesn't run or fight for"". 'Emotional, cruel, euphoric' - the incredible semi-final This video can not be played Barbora Krejcikova pays tribute to inspiration Jana Novotna after win World number 32 Krejcikova had a difficult season before Wimbledon and admitted to ""doubts inside"" before her team told her to ""keep going and fighting"". She is now aiming to follow in the footsteps of compatriot Marketa Vondrousova, who stunned Ons Jabeur in last year's final. Krejcikova is the fifth Czech player to reach a Wimbledon final in the Open era, with other singles champions at SW19 including two-time winner Petra Kvitova and Jana Novotna, who coached Krejcikova before she died of ovarian cancer in 2017. ""We have a huge tennis history in the Czech Republic at Wimbledon,"" said Krejcikova.  ""When I was growing up, I had a lot of players that I could look up to."" She has the experience of playing in and winning a Grand Slam singles final, having triumphed at the 2021 French Open. She has also completed the career Slam in doubles, and has an Olympic doubles title to boot. Will that give her the advantage on Saturday - or will Paolini's never-give-up approach prove to be the difference? 'I miss her so much' - Krejcikova remembers Novotna Krejcikova, who won the French Open three years ago, reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January but was soon hampered with back problems and illnesses. She only played nine matches between the Australian Open and Wimbledon, winning three, with two of those victories coming in Birmingham in June. But at Wimbledon she has excelled, beating 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round, former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, and recovering from a set down to beat favourite Rybakina in the last four. Krejcikova can also take heart from the two women's doubles titles at Wimbledon she lifted with Katerina Siniakova in 2018 and 2022. And, always the doubles specialist, she still likes to approach the net to finish off points quickly - a stark contrast to Paolini who controls lengthy rallies from the baseline. Henry Patten has won two tournaments on tour, both with Harri Heliovaara who he started partnering this year. The men's doubles final, which features Briton Henry Patten, follows the women's final on Centre Court. Eight years ago, the 28-year-old was working courtside at Wimbledon as a statistician. Now Patten is a match away from his first Grand Slam title, having never previously gone beyond the third round of a major. ""Every single year I would watch Wimbledon and it's surreal for me given my pathway,"" he said. ""I think we have to remind ourselves how well we've done to get here."" Patten and Finland's Harri Heliovaara - who only teamed up in April and upset British 2023 champion Neal Skupski and New Zealand's Michael Venus in the last four - face Australian duo Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson in the final. Meanwhile, Andy Lapthorne will play in the quad wheelchair doubles final alongside Israel's Guy Sasson. They face Dutch duo and top seeds Sam Schroder and Niels Vink.

336,Sancho trains with Man Utd after Ten Hag meeting,"Jadon Sancho was a runner up in last season's Champions League final on loan with Borussia Dortmund Jadon Sancho has returned to training with Manchester United following a meeting with manager Erik ten Hag. The English winger, 24, fell out with Ten Hag last season and was forced to train away from the first team before rejoining former club Borussia Dortmund on loan in January. Sancho impressed at Dortmund and his future has been the subject of speculation this summer, but he returned to United on Wednesday for testing before training with his team-mates the following day. Meanwhile, veteran defender Jonny Evans has signed a new one-year deal with the club.  The 36-year-old Northern Irishman made 30 appearances for United last season after rejoining the club on a one-year deal from Leicester City. Simon Stone, chief football news reporter Club sources have confirmed a clear-the-air meeting took place between Ten Hag and Sancho earlier this week and both parties agreed to draw a line under their previous disagreement. It has not been established whether Ten Hag received the apology he demanded after Sancho posted an inflammatory message on social media in response to the United boss saying his training performances had not been good enough before a Premier League game at Arsenal in September. As recently the beginning of last month, United were adamant their intention was to sell Sancho, whether Ten Hag remained as manager or not. However, BBC Sport was told Sancho was resistant to that idea given he has a lucrative contract that runs to 2026. In addition, United were not certain of getting back the kind of transfer fee that would make economic sense, given they paid £73m for the England international in 2021. Sancho will not be involved in Monday's opening pre-season friendly with Rosenborg in Norway. However, sources say the 24-year-old will be available for the remainder of United's programme, which includes a trip to Edinburgh to play Rangers at Murrayfield on 20 July and a three-match tour of the United States. Man Utd close to £33.7m deal for striker Zirkzee Dutchman Van de Beek joins Girona from Man Utd  Evans, meanwhile, progressed through the club's academy to the senior side in his first spell before permanently moving to West Brom and then Leicester. He made a substitute appearance for Erik ten Hag's side in last season's FA Cup final victory over rivals Manchester City. ""I am delighted to have extended my contract at Manchester United for another season,"" said Evans. ""To play for this great club and feel the support from our incredible fans is always a privilege. ""Returning to the club last season was an honour; representing the team on the pitch alongside fantastic team-mates under an excellent manager. ""Winning the FA Cup together was an unforgettable experience; I know we can challenge for more trophies in the season ahead.""

335,"Remember me as 'decent', says retiring Anderson","This video can not be played Anderson gets standing ovation after England win James Anderson said he would like to be remembered as a “decent” bowler after he ended his legendary England career with victory over West Indies. Anderson took one more wicket as England wrapped up an innings win on the third morning, to end with 704 and sit third on the all-time list of Test bowlers. In moving and celebratory scenes at Lord’s, Anderson was given a guard of honour by both teams at the beginning of the day, then later appeared on the England balcony as spectators were allowed onto the outfield. “The way I have loved the sport so much, I would love for there to be people out there that have taken up the game because they have watched me bowl,” said the 41-year-old. “That people have been entertained by watching me bowl and there are kids or grown-ups who have taken up the art of swing bowling because they have seen me bowl. That would make me so happy.” Anderson, England’s all-time leading wicket-taker, is the most successful pace bowler in the history of the game, with only spinners Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne ahead of him on the all-time list. In a 21-year career he won 188 Test caps, more than any other England player, but said he retires without ever feeling like he was a “great” of the game. “You go so up and down,” he told Sky Sports. “Some series you feel amazing and some not quite on it and a batter gets the better of you. “Playing against Virat Kohli in the early days, you felt you could get him out every ball and then recently like you can’t get him out at all. You feel so inferior. “I have never felt great at any stage. I know that sounds strange. I have always thought ‘how can I get better for the next series?’. That has helped me play for such a long time.” This video can not be played England make short work of West Indies in Anderson's final Test Anderson said he wondered if his career was over during last summer’s Ashes series, when he only managed five wickets in four Tests. He survived to be part of the tour of India, when he became the first fast bowler to reach 700 wickets in the final Test, but is now retiring from international cricket after the England management told him they want to blood younger bowlers. And, despite being part of four Ashes series wins, Anderson said he did not “nail” cricket against Australia, whereas his long-term new-ball partner Stuart Broad often found his best against England’s oldest rivals. “Unlike Stuart I don’t feel like I ever rose to the occasion,” said Anderson. “There were times where maybe I was trying too hard.” Anderson will immediately move into England’s backroom staff, becoming a bowling mentor for the second Test at Trent Bridge next week. England captain Ben Stokes has said Anderson could be part of the coaching team for the Ashes tour of Australia in 2025-26. Anderson has said he is unlikely to play county cricket for Lancashire again this summer, but has not ruled out a return in 2025, when he will be nearly 43. ""It is difficult to know what is next,” Anderson told Test Match Special. “I have never retired before so it is hard to think about how you will feel. “I am a competitive person. No matter what I do I am competitive at it. That is probably the thing I will miss the most – getting into the battle. “Trying to work a batter out, work out his strengths and weaknesses and get the better of him.

332,RFK Jr texts apology to sexual assault accuser - reports,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has apologised to a former family babysitter who accused him of sexual assault, US media report. Mr Kennedy reportedly texted his apology to Eliza Cooney, shortly after her allegations were published in Vanity Fair magazine.  Ms Cooney accused the former environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist of groping her on several occasions in the late 1990s. “I have no memory of this incident but I apologize sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable or anything I did or said that offended you or hurt your feelings,” Mr Kennedy said according to screenshots of the text the woman shared with US media. “I never intended you any harm. If I hurt you, it was inadvertent. I feel badly for doing so.” The message was first reported on Friday by the Washington Post and Reuters, which said it had verified the message and linked the phone number it was sent from to Kennedy. Mr Kennedy told the Post “the text message speaks for itself"" declining to comment further. The BBC has contacted Mr Kennedy’s campaign for comment. Ms Cooney was 23 at the time of the alleged assault and was working as a live-in babysitter to Mr Kennedy’s children and at the same time helping him with his legal work. She told the Post that she found the message from Mr Kennedy “disingenuous and arrogant”. “I’m not sure how somebody has a true apology for something that they don’t admit to recalling. I did not get a sense of remorse,” she said. The Vanity Fair story included a number of allegations about the candidate, including that he ate dog meat during a trip abroad, had several extramarital affairs and vigorously defended a cousin, Michael Skakel, who was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old girl in Greenwich, Connecticut. Mr Kennedy, the nephew of President John F Kennedy and son of Robert F Kennedy, called the story a ""lot of garbage"".  He denied eating dog meat and shortly after the story came out he told a podcast: ""I am not a church boy."" “I had a very, very rambunctious youth,” he said. “I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.” He did not directly address the sexual assault allegations.

330,I was arrested because of my baby's birthmark,"The mother of a six-month-old baby said she was treated ""like a criminal"" after her son's birthmarks were mistaken for bruising. Laxmi Thapa's son was born with blue spot - blue-grey markings common on babies with brown or black skin. After being referred to hospital in Basingstoke she was arrested when medical staff and police followed procedures for suspected child abuse. Campaigners have called for better awareness of the condition and said misdiagnosis can be ""devastating"" for wrongly accused families.  Ms Thapa, a Nepalese national living in Basingstoke, had taken her baby to her GP in May after becoming concerned that the blue spot markings had become darker and he had developed new ones. Her son's existing blue spot - sometimes known as Mongolian blue spot - on several parts of his body had been noted in his medical records, following his birth in November. Ms Thapa was referred to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital where she was arrested by police on suspicion of actual bodily harm assault and neglect of her baby. The 29-year-old, who was breastfeeding at the time, spent 20 hours in a cell at Basingstoke Police Station until being released pending a medical report. ""It was hard for me,"" she said. ""I have never been separated from my baby since his birth. ""At that time I was like a criminal. I stayed overnight in a cell like a criminal. ""Without medical proof, they put me in custody."" Her baby was looked after by the hospital while she was detained and she was permitted to express milk to allow him to be fed. After her release, a social services home visit determined her son was not in danger. A series of scans later showed no skeletal injuries and a dermatologist determined the markings were blue spot and not bruises. Police confirmed no assault had taken place. Faye Wheeler, founder of Blue Spot Campaign, said said she receives regular reports of misdiagnosis of the birthmarks, which she said can appear after the a child is born. She said: ""There is a lot of devastation from families and this leads to mistrust with working with health professionals. ""There seems to be a lot of suspicion around blue spot. I feel there is a lack of education, there is a lack of training."" Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it could not comment on individual cases, but said staff ""will have followed guidelines"". ""Safeguarding babies and children will always take priority,"" it said. ""Differentiating between suspected bruising and Mongolian blue spot is complex, and protocols have to be followed."" Det Ch Insp Gemma Anacora, from Hampshire Constabulary, said police  automatically become involved when a case was referred as a child safeguarding issue. She said: ""I do sympathise, it must be a very difficult situation, however we do follow procedures, so her arrest was necessary for us to obtain evidence by questioning and to safeguard the child through bail conditions."" Independent child protection researcher Dr Bernard Gallagher, from the University of Huddersfield, said it was an ""appropriate expectation"" for agencies to intervene when child abuse was suspected. ""Sometimes they make mistakes and maybe they are acting too drastically or too quickly, but it’s a very difficult balance to strike,"" he said. Ms Thapa said she had received a verbal apology from a doctor at the hospital. She is working with local campaign group Basingstoke Unites Against Racism on an official complaint. In a statement it said: ""We are committed to addressing all concerns within the BAME community. This includes collaborating with external organisations, as we did in this case, to ensure comprehensive support."" Ms Thapa said: ""I am going through this situation that was unacceptable and I don't want others to,"" she said. ""I don't want anyone to be separated from their baby like I was.""

326,French rugby players charged with raping woman in Argentina,"Two French international rugby players have been charged with the aggravated rape of a woman following a match in Argentina, prosecutors in the South American country say.  Hugo Auradou, 20, and Oscar Jegou, 21, are accused of raping a 39-year-old woman after France beat Argentina on Saturday.  She alleges that they raped her multiple times and beat her in a hotel room in the city of Mendoza.  The pair, who chose ""not to testify"" at a hearing in the city, say they had consensual sex with the woman and deny rape. They will remain in custody while authorities investigate further.  Warning: this story contains details that some readers may find upsetting The woman alleged the attack took place at the Diplomatic Hotel, where France's players and staff were staying as part of a tour of South America.  Her lawyer says she left a nightclub with one of the men and accompanied him to the hotel room, where she alleges that she was raped ""at least six times"" by one of the men and once by the other.  Ms Romano told AFP that her client suffered ""fierce"" violence, with injuries to her face, back, breasts, legs and ribs as well as various bite and scratch marks. The woman was held against her will for several hours and tried to escape several times, Ms Romano said. Her client went to hospital on Thursday after feeling ill emotionally and physically because of the incident and is receiving treatment at a health facility, she added. On Friday a lawyer for the players said his clients were confident in their version of events. ""They are well and sure of their version, they are calm because they know they are innocent, but of course they are worried about this whole situation that they have had to live through,"" German Hnatow told reporters. On Wednesday another lawyer said the ""sexual relations"" had been consensual.  ""There are witnesses who saw her leave [the hotel]. There are cameras that saw her leave.  Apparently no injuries are seen in the footage,"" Mariano Cuneo Libarona told journalists.  French Rugby Federation (FFR) president Florian Gill, who is in Argentina, also told AFP that the players had ""quite a different version of events"".  ""We are not judges. We are not investigators. But we think that the Argentine justice system should look at the case very quickly,"" he said.

331,What world leaders thought of Biden’s Nato summit performance,"Western leaders have rallied round Joe Biden at the Nato summit, amid concerns about the US president's age and ability to serve another term. Calls are growing for Mr Biden to drop out of the presidential race this November, and his attempts to diminish fears about his re-election bid at the summit were marred by two serious gaffes. French President Emmanuel Macron said Mr Biden was ""in charge"" and ""clear on the issues he knows well"", while UK PM Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""on good form"". But Mr Biden's first gaffe, in which he introduced Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin, was ridiculed in the Russian media.  And later in a news conference - Mr Biden's first unscripted public appearance since the debate - he referred to his ""Vice-President Trump"" when meaning to say Kamala Harris. The US president has been under pressure to quit since a disastrous performance two weeks ago in a debate with his Republican rival in the upcoming elections, Donald Trump. But throughout the summit, other Nato leaders have defended him and his ability to lead.  Mr Macron, speaking after Thursday's White House dinner, said he had had a long discussion with Mr Biden during the meal, and appealed for understanding of his flaws. ""I saw him as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well,"" he said. ""We all make slips of the tongue sometimes. It has happened to me before, it will probably happen to me tomorrow. ""I would ask you to show the same leniency that should be shown between caring people."" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also addressed the gaffes.  “Slips of the tongue happen, and if you always monitor everyone, you will find enough of them,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir said repeatedly during the summit that the US president had achieved much to be proud of there, and was ""across all the detail"". On Friday he added: ""We've been through two days of this council and come to a very good outcome... And I think he should be given credit for that."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was a privilege and a pleasure to work with Mr Biden. ""[Biden's] depth of experience, his thoughtfulness, his steadfastness on the greatest issues and challenges of our time is a credit to the work that we're all doing together,"" he said. Polish President Andrzej Duda, seen as being close to former President Trump, said, quoted by AFP: ""I talked with President Biden, and there is no doubt that everything is ok."" Meanwhile Finnish President Alexander Stubb combined a defence of Mr Biden with fears about the atmosphere in the US elections. ""I have absolutely no concern about the capacity of the current president of the United States to lead his country and to lead our fight for Ukraine and to lead Nato,"" he said, quoted by AFP. ""The only thing I'm worried about is that the political climate in the United States right now is too toxic, is very polarised, and that doesn't leave enough room for a civilised and constructive debate."" Not all Nato leaders were prepared to weigh in on behalf of Mr Biden, though. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán reportedly made almost no comments to the media in Washington. Instead he left immediately after the end of the summit for Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump's Florida residence, where the two men talked about the war in Ukraine. ""We discussed ways to make peace,"" Mr Orbán said on social media. ""The good news of the day: he's going to solve it!""  But if leaders of allied countries have been unwilling to criticise the US president for his frailties, Moscow has been similarly restrained. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the gaffes were clearly slips of the tongue and ""not our business, an internal matter for the USA"". Not so the Russian media, which have been all over Mr Biden's confusion of Mr Putin with Mr Zelensky. Official Rossiya TV showed it at the top of its 9pm bulletin, saying that ""America's vassals pretended that they'd not noticed anything"". NTV said Biden had never been so close to a fiasco and that his ""latest slip of the tongue is worthy of an Oscar"". And popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets ran an article headlined ""Senile Leaders"", comparing Joe Biden to the elderly Communist leaders of the USSR. ""What's more dangerous, a monkey with a grenade or a shaking hand on the nuclear button?"" it asked.
