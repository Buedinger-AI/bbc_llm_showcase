0,Israel examining Hamas response to ceasefire plan,"Israel says it is studying a response by Hamas to a Gaza ceasefire plan outlined by President Biden at the end of May. It comes after Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators Egypt and Qatar ""about the ideas"" it has been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until it eliminates Hamas. A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC Hamas is no longer insisting on a full ceasefire at the outset of the three-phase plan. President Biden said the plan which he outlined was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal. The first phase would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve a ""permanent end to hostilities"" and the third phase a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and completion of return of dead hostages' remains. A joint statement from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Mossad intelligence agency on Wednesday night said the mediators had ""conveyed to the [Israeli] negotiating team Hamas's remarks on the outline of the hostages deal"". ""Israel is evaluating the remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators,"" it added. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Thursday that Hamas has given up the condition of a complete ceasefire in exchange for new conditions related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's southern border area known as the Philadelphi corridor and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of Hamas’s response submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere is positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 37,953 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

1,India preacher denies blame for crush deaths,"The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation. A lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred ""due to some anti-social elements"", and blamed a ""criminal conspiracy hatched against"" his client. Bhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said. Nearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district. On Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event.  The case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures. Mr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing.  “Totally false allegation,"" Mr Singh told the BBC. ""Security staff always provide help to the followers.” This is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years.  Shocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes. The crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering. An initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event. The report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue. As people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed. One of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving. “Some crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,” Mr Yadav said. The police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed. Bhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari.  One senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him. He was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said. The preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts. Bhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village. His lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram. The preacher has not been named in the initial police complaint.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk5q27jd4o,"Anbarasan Ethirajan,",2024-07-04 10:49:19,Unknown
2,Many Jamaicans without power after Hurricane Beryl thunders through,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica are without power, after Hurricane Beryl thundered along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - has brought more than 12 hours of heavy rain, prompting concerns about flash flooding. An island-wide curfew was extended until 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday, and while the hurricane warning has been cancelled, it has been replaced with a flash flood watch. Once the sun rises and the curfew is over, residents will be able to go outside and get a real idea of the damage. Beryl has now weakened to a category three storm, and is rolling towards the Cayman Islands and southern Mexico, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports. But it has left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, and caused the deaths of at least seven people. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Energy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” Caribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. ""This storm will pass, and we will recover,"" he said. Beryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where ""strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected"", the NHC warned. The islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there. Hurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died. It became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

3,Kris Jenner shares plans for removal of her ovaries,"US reality TV star Kris Jenner has spoken emotionally about plans to have her ovaries removed. In scenes during reality show, The Kardashians, the US media personality and businesswoman revealed she was set to have the procedure after doctors found a cyst and a tumour. While on holiday in Aspen, Colorado with partner Corey Gamble, Jenner broke the news to her daughters, Kendall, Kim and Khloé Kardashian. ""I wanted to tell you guys something because I hadn’t told you yet, but I went to the doctor and I had my scan,"" she said. ""And this just makes me really emotional, but… they found a cyst and like a little tumour on my ovary."" ""So I went to the doctor, and Dr A said I have to have my ovaries taken out. And I'm just really emotional about it because they came in handy with you guys. ""It’s also a thing about getting older,"" she added. ""It’s a sign of 'we’re done with this part of your life.' It’s a whole chapter that’s just closed."" Jenner has six children. Kim, Khloé, Kourtney and Rob Kardashian, from her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian. She also has Kendall and Kylie Jenner, from her marriage to Caitlyn Jenner. Kris Jenner added that her biggest achievement was raising her family. ""People often ask me what is the best job you’ve ever had, and I always say mom,"" she said. ""The biggest blessing in my life was being able to give birth to six beautiful kids."" Speaking to the camera, Kim Kardashian empathised with why her mother was upset. ""To have a surgery and remove your ovaries is a really big deal,"" she said. ""I feel really sad for her. I couldn't even imagine being in that situation and how you would feel really scared to be going through that."" Kourtney also agreed, saying she ""would feel the same way"". ""It's like your womanly power,"" she added.  ""It doesn’t mean it’s taking away who she is or what she’s experienced, but I would feel this sentimental feeling of what it’s created."" Kendall added: ""I get that it's sad because they [her ovaries] have brought all her kids into the world, which is totally fair. ""But at the same time, what are we going to use those for anymore? If they're potentially hurting you, let's get them out of there.""",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cydv4je6g11o,"Bonnie McLaren,",2024-07-04 10:52:19,Unknown

5,Ukraine calls them meat assaults: Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
6,How does the UK general election work?,"Millions of people are expected to cast their ballots in Thursday's UK general election that will decide who runs the country. The poll is voters' first chance since December 2019 to decide who should represent them as their local Member of Parliament, or MP, in Westminster. Most will choose their preferred candidate in person at polling stations across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Others have already done the same job using postal votes. Here are some of the key things to know. Polling stations across the UK opened at 07:00 BST (02:00 EST), closing at 22:00.   The 4 July date was set by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a televised address on 22 May that marked the start of a six-week campaign. He had to declare a vote by 17 December, according to rules that required him to do so before the fifth anniversary of the day that the previous Parliament first sat. Anyone on the UK electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote - as long as they are a UK citizen, a qualifying citizen of a country in the Commonwealth, or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has an address in the UK. And UK citizens living abroad can vote in areas where they were previously on the electoral roll. People who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and members of the UK's upper chamber, the House of Lords.  All 650 MP seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs. Each member voted into the House solely represents a single voting area, or constituency. Under the first-past-the-post system, the candidate who wins the most votes in any given constituency becomes the MP. They simply need to beat all the other candidates to emerge victorious; they do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Losing candidates get nothing. What is at stake for the parties? A chance to lead the country as the next government. Results from across the UK will arrive overnight and into Friday morning. After the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to form a government. If no party ends up with a majority of at least 326 seats - meaning it faces being unable to pass new laws without the help of others - the result is known as a hung parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister - an action that is also confirmed by an official conversation with the King. That person leads the UK government and takes responsibility for deciding its direction and priorities, as well as other tasks like representing the country abroad. Meanwhile, the leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. Sitting opposite government MPs in the House of Commons, they lead their MPs in challenging or scrutinising decisions made by the governing party. Like other UK broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigns or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election. During that time, it is in fact a criminal offence to publish information about how people say they have voted in the election. That is why coverage until the close of polls is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports. And the lists of candidates and their pledges stay available online.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd9gdz3pjdo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 08:39:19,Unknown
7,'It's a disaster': Hurricane Beryl batters Jamaica,"Powerful Hurricane Beryl has hit Jamaica with heavy winds and rain, damaging buildings and felling trees on the Caribbean island. The category four storm brought winds of up to 130mph (215km/h) on Jamaica's southern coast. Social media photos show floodwater pouring down streets, with roofs ripped off by the wind. The storm has killed at least seven people so far as it sweeps across the Caribbean. It has now been downgraded to a category three storm, and is due to make landfall in Mexico later on Friday. ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" Amoy Wellington, resident of a rural farming community in the southern St Elizabeth parish, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""It's a disaster."" Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier urged people to ""take this hurricane seriously"".  ""If you live in a low-lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide, or if you live on the banks of a river or a gully, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,"" he said. Three people died in Grenada, where it first made landfall on Monday, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and another three in northern Venezuela, which was hit by strong winds and flooding.  About 90% of homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Union Island, which is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines. Parts of Jamaica earlier experienced disruption to power and electricity supplies, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) saying it was forced to pause restoration of power lines in some locations for the safety of their workers.  In a news briefing, the NHC's director, Dr Michael Brennan, said Jamaica would experience ""devastating hurricane force winds"". Rainfall in some parts of the country could hit 12in (30cm), potentially leading to flooding and mudslides, the director explained, while life-threatening storm surges as high as 9ft (2.7m) above tide level are also expected. ""Everybody in Jamaica needs to be in their safe place and be prepared to stay there for at least the next 12 hours,"" Dr Brennan warned. The BBC's Nick Davis said Jamaicans had been rushing to supermarkets earlier in the week to get ""as much as they could as quickly as they could"". Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said the island had 900 shelters to house people who needed to leave their homes. In Venezuela, Hurricane Beryl brought heavy rains which caused a river to overflow in the northern state of Sucre. Three people died and several are still missing. A government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage. President Nicolás Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was among those injured. He said she was ""very bruised but conscious"". In Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Cancún have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves. The NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual. Meteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. The storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency. In Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.  On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the state's Atlantic coast to ""keep an eye on the gulf"" and ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"". The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gm528k4mo,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jaroslav Lukiv,",2024-07-04 03:39:19,Unknown
8,Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support,"The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face. “I am an academic doctor,” he says, “I had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!” The video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month. Warning: Graphic image Seconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd. “I’m one of you,” he says, “but you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!” The video went viral. And it’s not the only one.  Open criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online. Some have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas. Residents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of ""Yallah, Sinwar!"" “People say things like, ‘Hamas has destroyed us’ or even call on God to take their lives,” one man said.  “They ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.” Some are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel. There are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it’s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind. But even some on the group’s own payroll are wavering. One senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were “a crazy, uncalculated leap”. He asked that we concealed his identity. “I know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,” he said. “They did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.” There was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals. The last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party. A year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip. Ameen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there. “In Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,” he said.  “They see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza’s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.” Desperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was.  Four-fifths of Gaza’s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters. And law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime. As control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged. One staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described ""absolute chaos at street level"" and ""a state of anarchy"", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy. Israel’s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas’s military and governing capabilities are destroyed. But some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting. One well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area. Fear of criticising Gaza’s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn’t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting. Some, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas.  Displaced from the Zeitoun area of Gaza City with his wife, daughter and mother, and now sheltering in Deir al Balah, he said the group was not responsible for their suffering. “We must support [Hamas] because it’s the one working on the ground, the one who understands the battle - not you or I,” he said. “Empty accusations only serve the Occupation [Israel]. We’ll support it until our last breath.” A regular poll carried out by a West Bank-based think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, claims that most people in Gaza still blame Israel and its allies for the war, rather than Hamas. The latest survey in June said that almost two-thirds of Gazan respondents were satisfied with Hamas - a rise of 12 points from December - and suggested that just around half would still prefer Hamas to run Gaza after the war ends, over any other option. These results differ from several accounts given to the BBC, including from a senior Hamas official who privately acknowledged that they were losing support as a result of the war. These glimpses through chinks in the media blockade around Gaza can never give a full assessment of the situation. International journalists are barred by Israel and Egypt from reporting on the situation there first-hand. What is clear is that Hamas remains very sensitive to public opinion. Strikingly similar messages regularly appear on certain social media platforms to justify its actions, often apparently in response to criticism at home. A source familiar with Hamas told the BBC there was an organised international network to co-ordinate social media messaging for the group. After Israeli families released a video showing the moment female soldiers were kidnapped by Hamas units on 7 October, some in Gaza questioned whether targeting women during war was in line with Islamic teaching. In response, several pro-Hamas social media accounts put out similar messages insisting that soldiers - male or female - were justified military targets, and saying the unit had been involved in shooting Gazan protestors during demonstrations six years ago. Criticism of Hamas is growing sharper, and long-buried divisions over Hamas rule in Gaza are becoming clear. Out of the destruction left by Israel’s battle with Hamas, a new war is emerging: a battle for control of public opinion within Gaza itself.",2024-07-04 11:39:19,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewvp14zdo,"Lucy Williamson & Rushdi Aboualouf,",2024-07-03 23:39:19,Unknown
9,Biden says he 'screwed up' debate but vows to stay in election,"US President Joe Biden has admitted he ""screwed up"" in last week's debate against Donald Trump, but has vowed to fight on in the election race and moved to reassure key allies. He told a Wisconsin radio station he made a ""mistake"" with his stumbling performance, but urged voters to instead judge him on his time in the White House. On Wednesday, as reports suggested he was weighing his future, he worked to calm senior Democrats including state governors and campaign staff. “I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving,"" he said in a call to the broader campaign, a source told BBC News. Mr Biden was joined on the call by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who reiterated her support.  Speculation has mounted over whether she could replace the president as the party’s candidate ahead of the November election. A fundraising email sent after the call by the Biden-Harris campaign was also bullish. “Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running,” Mr Biden said. Questions have been swirling around whether the 81-year-old will continue with his campaign following a debate marked by verbal blanks and a weak voice.  It sparked concern in Democratic circles around his fitness for office and his ability to win the election. Pressure on Mr Biden to drop out has only grown as more polls suggest his Republican rival’s lead has widened.  A New York Times poll conducted after the debate, which was published on Wednesday, suggested Trump was now holding his biggest lead yet at six points. And a separate poll published by the BBC’s US partner CBS News suggested Trump has a three-point lead over Mr Biden in the crucial battleground states.  The damaging polling for Mr Biden has been compounded by some Democratic donors and lawmakers publicly calling on the president to stand aside.  Among them are Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American industrialist based in Massachusetts, who has organised fundraisers for Democrats since 1988.  “I think it’s time for him to pass the torch,” Mr Kapur told the BBC. “I know he has the drive, but you can’t fight Mother Nature.” And two Democrats in Congress also called for a change at the top of the party’s ticket. The second, Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, told the New York Times it was time for Democrats to “look elsewhere”. Despite this, the White House and the Biden campaign have vehemently denied reports he is actively weighing his future and say he is committed to defeating Trump for a second time on 5 November. The New York Times and CNN reported on Wednesday that Mr Biden had told an unnamed ally he was aware his re-election bid was in danger. His forthcoming appearances - including an ABC News interview and a Friday rally in Wisconsin - were hugely important to his campaign, he reportedly said.  A spokesperson rejected the reports as “absolutely false”, shortly before White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said reports that he may drop out were untrue. Among the senior Democrats Mr Biden met on Wednesday was a group of 20 state governors from around the country, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. Both have been tipped as potential replacements if Mr Biden were to stand aside. ""The president has always had our backs, we’re going to have his back as well,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore told reporters after the meeting.  But Ms Harris is still considered the most likely replacement. The 59-year-old has been hampered by poor approval ratings, but her support has increased among Democrats since the Biden-Trump debate. Amid the speculation, comments made by Trump indicated he could be switching his attention to attacking Ms Harris.  In footage obtained by the Daily Beast - and shared online by Trump himself - he can be seen in a golf cart pouring scorn on Mr Biden, whom he describes as ""broken down"". He suggests that Ms Harris would be ""better"", though still ""pathetic"". The vice-president gave an immediate interview on CNN after the debate, projecting calm as she expressed full support for the president.  ""She has always been mindful to be a good partner to the president,"" her former communications director Jamal Simmons told BBC News.  ""The people who ultimately will make the decision about who the nominee should be mostly are people who are pledged to him. Her best role is to be a partner to him."" A source close to Ms Harris said nothing had changed and she would continue to campaign for the president. Members of the Democratic National Committee are charged with voting to officially make President Biden the party’s nominee at the August convention, putting him on the ballot nationwide.  One member, who has spoken to other delegates and requested anonymity to speak frankly about sensitive discussions, told the BBC that the nomination should go to Vice-President Harris if Mr Biden opted not to run.  “If we open up the convention, it will cause pure chaos that will hurt us in November,"" they said. A report by the Washington Post, meanwhile, said Mr Biden and his team recognised that he must demonstrate his fitness for office in the coming days.  He has planned trips to Wisconsin and Philadelphia later in the week, and is due to appear on ABC News on Friday for his first televised interview since the debate.  His full interview with Wisconsin's Civic Media is also due to be published on Thursday.  While acknowledging that he had ""screwed up"" with his performance, he told the station: ""That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years.""

20,An iconic wildlife park has banned koala cuddles. Will others follow?,"For what seems like time immemorial, giving a fluffy little koala a cuddle has been an Australian rite of passage for visiting celebrities, tourists and locals alike. And for many of them, a wildlife park in a leafy pocket of Queensland has been the place making dreams come true. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary has entertained everyone from pop giant Taylor Swift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as of this month, the small zoo – a Brisbane icon which bills itself as the world’s first koala sanctuary – has decided it will no longer offer “koala hold experiences”. Lone Pine said the move is in response to increasingly strong visitor feedback.  “We love that there is a shift among both local and international guests to experience Australian wildlife up close, but not necessarily personal, just doing what they do best - eating, sleeping and relaxing within their own space,” said General Manager Lyndon Discombe. Animal rights groups say they hope this is a sign that the practice - which they argue is ""cruel"" -  will be phased out nation-wide.  They quote studies which have found that such encounters stress koalas out - especially given that the creatures are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals who sleep most of the day. Koalas are a much beloved national icon – priceless in biodiversity terms, but also a golden goose for the tourism industry, with one study from 2014 estimating they’re worth A$3.2bn ($2.14bn; £1.68bn) each year and support up to 30,000 jobs. However the once-thriving marsupial is in dramatic decline, having been ravaged by land clearing, bushfires, drought, disease and other threats.  Estimates vary greatly, but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered along much of the east coast. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. And so protecting koalas, both in the wild and in captivity, is an emotional and complex topic in Australia. All states have strict environmental protections for the species, and many of them have already outlawed koala ""holding"". For example, New South Wales – Australia’s most populous state - banned it in 1997. There, the rules state that a koala cannot be “placed directly on… or [be] directly held by any visitor for any purpose”. But in Queensland – and a select few places in South Australia and Western Australia – the practice continues. For those willing to fork out, they can snap a picture cuddling a koala, for example at Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld for A$29.95 and the internationally renowned Australia Zoo for A$124.  Steve Irwin even went on the record to argue that these experiences help conservation efforts. “When people touch an animal, the animal touches their heart. And instantly, we’ve won them over to the conservation of that species,” the late conservationist once said. And the Queensland government say there are clear rules around this. For starters, the koalas cannot be used for photography for more than three days in a row before they’re required to have a day off.  They can only be on duty for 30 minutes a day, and a total of 180 minutes each week. And females with joeys must not be handled by the public. “I used to joke, as the environment minister, that our koalas have the best union around,” said Queensland Premier Steven Miles. Right groups have welcomed Lone Pine's decision - but some have called for such attractions to eventually be removed altogether.  “The future of wildlife tourism is seeing wild animals in the wild where they belong,"" said Suzanne Milthorpe of the World Animal Protection (WAP).  Wild koalas avoid interactions with humans, but at these attractions have no choice but to be exposed to unfamiliar visitors, sights and noises, says WAP – a London-based group which campaigns to end the use of captive wild animals in entertainment venues. “Tourists are increasingly moving away from outdated, stressful selfie encounters."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Australia also says that ""in the ideal world, koalas would never have contact with humans"", adding that they would like to see this approach ""adopted across the board"". “As cute as they are, koalas are still wild animals in captivity and are extremely susceptible to stress,” Oceania director Rebecca Keeble told the BBC. “Their welfare is paramount and as they are an endangered species we need to do all we can to protect them.” But the hope that Lone Pine's move would add momentum towards a state-wide ban appears to have been scuppered. A government spokesperson told the BBC there is no intention of changing the law - and Lone Pine itself has also clarified that it supports the laws as is. However WAP says it will keep piling pressure on other venues to leave the koalas on their trees. “Ultimately, we need the Queensland Government to consign this cruel practice to the history books.""",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ge1vn783eo,"Tiffanie Turnbull,",2024-07-04 08:39:20,Unknown
18,"A Bugatti car, a first lady and the fake stories aimed at Americans","A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it. The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true. Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money. The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story. But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely. One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics. It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.  Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters. Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress. The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society. Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics. It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations. Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign. While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West. “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said. The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment. Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making “fake news” operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible. The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American – Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.  Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software. In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance”.  The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet. For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, “written” by an online persona called “Jessica Devlin”. “I was totally confused,” Ms Batalion told the BBC. “I still don't really understand what my photo was doing on this website.” Ms Batalion said she assumed the photo had been copied and pasted from her LinkedIn profile. “I had no contact with this website,” she said. “It's made me more self-conscious about the fact that any photo of yourself online can be used by someone else.”    The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated. Casual browsers could easily come away with the impression that the sites are thriving sources of legitimate news about politics and hot-button social issues. However, interspersed within this tsunami of content is the real meat of the operation - fake stories aimed increasingly at American audiences. The stories often blend American and Ukrainian political issues - for instance one claimed that a worker for a Ukrainian propaganda outfit was dismayed to find that she was assigned tasks designed to knock down Donald Trump and bolster President Biden. Another report invented a New York shopping trip made by Ukraine’s first lady, and alleged she was racist towards staff at a jewellery store. The BBC has found that forged documents and fake YouTube videos were used to bolster both false stories. Some of the fakes break out and get high rates of engagement on social media, said Clement Briens, senior threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. His company says that 120 websites were registered by the operation - which it calls CopyCop - over just three days in May. And the network is just one of a number of Russia-based disinformation operations. Other experts - at Microsoft, Clemson University, and at Newsguard, a company that tracks misinformation sites - have also been tracking the network. Newsguard says it has counted at least 170 sites connected to the operation. “Initially, the operation seemed small,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, Newsguard’s AI and foreign influence editor. “As each week passed it seemed to be growing significantly in terms of size and reach. People in Russia would regularly cite and boost these narratives, via Russian state TV, Kremlin officials and Kremlin influencers. “There's about a new narrative originating from this network almost every week or two,” she said. To further bolster the credibility of the fake stories, operatives create YouTube videos, often featuring people who claim to be “whistleblowers” or “independent journalists”. In some cases the videos are narrated by actors – in others it appears they are AI-generated voices. Several of the videos appear to be shot against a similar-looking background, further suggesting a co-ordinated effort to spread fake news stories. The videos aren’t themselves meant to go viral, and have very few views on YouTube. Instead, the videos are quoted as “sources” and cited in text stories on the fake newspaper websites.  For instance, the story about the Ukrainian information operation allegedly targeting the Trump campaign cited a YouTube video which purported to include shots from an office in Kyiv, where fake campaign posters were visible on the walls. Links to the stories are then posted on Telegram channels and other social media accounts. Eventually, the sensational “scoops” - which, like the Trump wiretap story and a slew of earlier stories about Ukrainian corruption, often repeat themes already popular among patriotic Russians and some supporters of Donald Trump - can reach both Russian influencers and audiences in the West. Although only a few rise to the highest levels of prominence, some have spread to millions – and to powerful people. A story which originated on DC Weekly, claiming that Ukrainian officials bought yachts with US military aid, was repeated by several members of Congress, including Senator J D Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Mr Vance is one of a handful of politicians mentioned as a potential vice-presidential running mate for Donald Trump. One of the key people involved in the operation is John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine who worked as a police officer in Florida and Maine in the 2000s. Mr Dougan later set up a website designed to collect leaked information about his former employer, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. In a harbinger of his activities in Russia, Mr Dougan’s site published authentic information including the home addresses of police officers, alongside fake stories and rumours. The FBI raided his apartment in 2016, at which point he fled to Moscow. He has since written books, reported from occupied parts of Ukraine and has made appearances on Russian think tank panels, at military events and on a TV station owned by Russia’s ministry of defence. In text message conversations with the BBC, Mr Dougan has flatly denied being involved with the websites. On Tuesday, he denied any knowledge of the story about the Bugatti sports car.   But at other times he has bragged about his prowess in spreading fake news. At one point he also implied that his activities are a form of revenge against American authorities. “For me it’s a game,"" he said. “And a little payback.” At another point he said: “My YouTube channel received many strikes for misinformation” for his reporting from Ukraine, raising the prospect of his channel being taken offline. “So if they want to say misinformation, well, let’s do it right,” he texted.  A large body of digital evidence also shows connections between the former police officer and the Russia-based websites. The BBC and experts we consulted traced IP addresses and other digital information back to websites run by Dougan. At one point a story on the DC Weekly site, written in response to a New York Times piece which mentioned Dougan, was attributed to “An American Citizen, the owner of these sites,” and stated: “I am the owner, an American citizen, a US military veteran, born and raised in the United States.” The article signed off with Dougan’s email address. Shortly after we reported on Mr Dougan’s activities in a previous story, a fake version of the BBC website briefly appeared online. It was linked through digital markers to his network.  Mr Dougan is most likely not the only person working on the influence operation and who funds it remains unclear. “I think it's important not to overplay his role in this campaign,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensic Hub, which has been tracking the network. “He may be just a bit of a bit player and a useful dupe, because he's an American.” Despite his appearances on state-run media and at government-linked think tanks, Mr Dougan denies he is being paid by the Kremlin. “I have never been paid a single dime by the Russian government,” he said via text message. The operation that Dougan is involved in has increasingly shifted its focus from stories about the war in Ukraine to stories about American and British politics. The false article about the FBI and the alleged wiretap at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort was one of the first stories produced by the network that was entirely about US politics, with no mention of Ukraine or Russia. Clint Watts, who leads Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center, said that the operation often blends together issues with salience both in Ukraine and the West. Mr Watts said that the volume of content being posted and the increasing sophistication of Russia-based efforts could potentially pose a significant problem in the run-up to November’s election. “They're not getting mass distribution every single time,” he said, but noted that several attempts made each week could lead to false narratives taking hold in the “information ocean” of a major election campaign. “It can have an outsized impact"", and stories from the network can take off very quickly, he said. “Gone are the days of Russia purchasing ads in roubles, or having pretty obvious trolls that are sitting in a factory in St. Petersburg,” said Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, a non-profit organisation attempting to combat the spread of disinformation. Ms Jankowicz was briefly director of the short-lived US Disinformation Governance Board, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security designed to tackle false information. “Now we're seeing a lot more information laundering,” she said - using a term referring to the recycling of fake or misleading stories into the mainstream in order to obscure their ultimate source.  Microsoft researchers also say the operation is attempting to spread stories about UK politics – with an eye on Thursday’s general election – and the Paris Olympics. One fake story – which appeared on the website called the London Crier – claimed that Mr Zelensky bought a mansion owned by King Charles III at a bargain price.   It was seen by hundreds of thousands of users on X, and shared by an official Russian embassy account. YouTube removed an AI-narrated video posted by an obscure channel that was used as the source of the false story after it was flagged by BBC Verify.  And Mr Dougan hinted at even bigger plans when asked whether increased attention on his activities would slow the spread of his false stories. “Don’t worry,” he said, “the game is being upped.” Correction 4 July 2024: An earlier version of this story used the incorrect logo to represent the Chicago Chronicle website linked to this network.

17,"Lucy Letby: Courtroom drama, a failed appeal, and battles over the truth","When former nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering babies last year, news channels rolled on the story, and her mugshot was splashed across front pages and websites around the world.  The scale of Letby’s crimes, the extreme vulnerability of her victims, and unanswered questions about the nurse all combined to stoke interest in the case. But this was a saga that was still unfolding. Hospital consultants who’d suspected Letby spoke of the struggles they’d had to be heard. Public outcry quickly led to the announcement of a public inquiry.  Meanwhile, police said they were reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and were launching an investigation to establish whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges. There was blanket coverage. Then the news cycle moved on, and Lucy Letby fell out of the headlines.  But that wasn’t the only reason things went quiet. We can now explain why coverage of Letby’s story has been restricted over the last 10 months – and what we haven’t been able to report, until now. A month after Britain’s most notorious nurse was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it was seeking a fresh trial. Letby had been convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted murder. But there were six further charges on which jurors couldn’t decide. Now the CPS said it was intending to run a retrial to put one of those undecided charges before a new jury. The judge quickly imposed a court order prohibiting the reporting of anything that could prejudice the upcoming trial. The result was a virtual news blackout, at least temporarily. In the background, Letby’s defence team applied for permission to appeal against her convictions. There was no public hearing, and journalists weren’t told about Letby’s grounds for appeal - or the judge’s reasons when they decided to deny her request. But that wasn’t an end to it - Letby could make one final appeal request, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal in London - and this time the hearing would take place in public. Barristers, solicitors, police officers and journalists who’d been involved in the original trial traipsed down to the Royal Courts of Justice. Letby attended remotely, via a video link from a non-descript room in HMP Bronzefield, where she is currently an inmate.  It was the first time we’d seen her since she’d refused to turn up to her sentencing hearing. Her hair had grown, but it was still difficult to read anything from her expression – she maintained the same impassivity as she had during the trial. What unfolded in court was fascinating, but had to stay in our notebooks. Letby’s lawyers claimed her convictions were unsafe, calling into question the science behind the prosecution case, laying into the prosecution’s expert witness, and arguing part of the judge’s directions to the jury had been wrong. It was the first time since the end of her trial eight months earlier that anyone had heard her team set out its stall - but much of it was familiar to those of us who’d been following the case. The same attacks on the prosecution’s experts had been made during the course of the trial, and Letby’s lawyers had also previously argued against the judge’s legal directions. But Letby’s lead barrister, Ben Myers KC, a seasoned courtroom performer, had a couple of cards up his sleeve. The first was a saga involving a fight in a cafe, the theft of a mobile phone, and an email to the court from someone alleging they’d overheard a juror claim the jury had already made up their minds from the start of the trial. Although the judge had spoken to the juror and allowed him to carry on serving, Letby’s barrister argued this wasn’t enough. The judge, Mr Myers argued, should have questioned the person who’d made the allegation too.  None of this had anything to do with whether or not Letby had murdered babies - but it was thrown into the mix as one of the grounds for appeal. There was also a new witness - neonatologist Shoo Lee, from Toronto, the co-author of a 1989 medical research paper about air embolism in neonatal babies. An air embolism occurs when one or more air bubbles enter a vein or artery, causing a block in circulation. The consequences can be fatal.  Letby was found guilty of injecting air into the bloodstreams of some of the infants, causing air embolism. Prosecution experts had based some of their evidence on Dr Lee’s paper, although he hadn’t been called to give evidence. Now he was appearing on behalf of the defence. During the trial, much was made of changes in skin colour observed on some of the babies, which it was suggested were symptomatic of air embolism. The prosecution cited Dr Lee’s paper in support of this, and paediatric consultant Dr Ravi Jayaram told the court a “chill went down (his) spine” in June 2016 when he read the research and believed it fitted with what he’d seen on babies in Chester. But nobody had checked with Dr Lee. The point he now made, via webcam from 3,500 miles away, was that only one, very specific skin discolouration was diagnostic of air embolism, and none of the babies in the case had displayed this exactly.  For Letby’s defence, it was a basis for appeal. The prosecution disagreed. They argued that all of the instances of skin discoloration in the Letby case were consistent with air embolism, and some of these could be proven using Dr Lee’s own diagnostic method. They said Dr Lee hadn’t been shown any of the eyewitness testimony from the trial, or any of the babies’ records – and so was not qualified to weigh in now. Sitting on the uncomfortable wooden benches of court 4, one couldn’t help but wonder why this development hadn’t been aired at the trial. Letby’s lawyers were arguing the science was too weak to support as many as nine of her 14 convictions. But on 24 May, Court of Appeal judges again rejected Letby’s request for permission to appeal against her convictions. During Letby’s trial, online forums and communities sprang up, where users analysed the evidence as the case unfolded. There were views on everything from the science, to the barristers’ performance, and endless speculation about Letby herself.   Very few of those posting opinions were at Manchester Crown Court to watch the trial in person. The majority were following media reports, tweets, and a live blog on the Chester Standard newspaper’s website.  The online commentary was voluminous – and often in breach of legal restrictions. The trial judge directed jurors not to go online, or conduct their own extra-curricular research, and the hearings continued without anyone being prosecuted for contempt of court. After the verdicts finally came through last August, newspaper headlines screamed “Monster” and “Angel of Death”. But the view on the internet wasn’t always as condemnatory.  Sceptics appeared, including Richard Gill, a statistician in the Netherlands, who argued the data presented at the trial was flawed and used improperly. Sarrita Adams, a California-based biotech consultant, launched a campaign aimed at critiquing the science in Letby’s case. Her website invites donations and describes itself as “the first organisation dedicated to fighting for a new trial for Lucy Letby”. They weren’t the only ones. There are podcasts, blogs, websites and videos dedicated to the same topic. Some delve into the arguments presented by the defence about air embolism, and the expertise in the case. Others stray into different territory – statistics, or questions about other areas of science which Letby’s team have steered clear of. It was notable how the sceptics’ arguments weren’t incorporated in the defence submissions at the Court of Appeal. We understand some of those campaigning for Letby’s freedom have made repeated attempts to contact her, her inner circle, and her lawyers. But why the mismatch between the arguments raging online and those in the courtroom? It may be that Letby’s team has looked into the sceptics’ arguments and decided they don’t check out and wouldn’t stand up in a court of law. But that’s not the only possibility. Letby and her legal team didn’t have carte blanche to make any arguments they wanted in support of her request for permission to appeal. Criminal appeals are not “a second bite of the cherry”, as lawyers sometimes put it.  The only way Letby would be allowed to appeal against her conviction was if she could show the judge in her original trial had made a legal mistake, or there was new evidence that, had it been available at the time, might have led the jury to different verdicts.  That meant the range of arguments Letby’s legal team could present was limited. Cherry-picking the best of the online arguments was never an option. It’s also important to remember the one person in control of the defence case was Letby herself. Her lawyers advised her, but they were required to act according to her instructions. Letby has used the same local Chester solicitor since her arrest in 2018, and has been represented by the same barristers throughout both trials and the appeal. Whether she’s aware of the community campaigning in her name or not, she hasn’t signalled she’s unhappy with her lawyers’ strategy. Those who’ve continued to maintain the nurse’s innocence are undeterred. They seem to be increasingly vocal and at the first hearing of the Thirlwall Inquiry, which will examine the way the hospital dealt with Letby, barristers representing the parents of the babies spoke of the anguish these campaigns have caused. “The modern age has brought a proliferation of conspiracy theories which sprout, spread and fester on social media blogs and on websites,” Peter Skelton KC said. “Lucy Letby's crimes, in particular, continue to be the subject of such conspiracies, some of which are grossly offensive and distressing for the families of her victims.” The families’ lawyers argued, unsuccessfully, for the public inquiry to be live streamed when it gets under way in Liverpool in the autumn. “It is well known that the case has generated considerable public interest and that conspiracy theories have grown around it,” Richard Baker KC said. “They are toxic, they are often ill-informed, and they ultimately grow in the shadows. The more light that we put on this Inquiry, the less space there is for speculation and conspiracy.” It probably hasn’t helped that much of the reporting of the Letby case over the past year has been restricted by court orders, to protect the retrial. It has left an information vacuum - one the internet has happily filled. On 10 June, 10 months after she was first convicted of murdering and attempting to murder babies, Letby was back in court for her retrial on one count of attempted murder. Although there was a feeling of déjà vu - the same courtroom, the same lawyers, the same judge - there was something palpably different about the atmosphere. During the first trial, which had lasted for nearly a year, only five or six members of the public turned up with any regularity. They sat quietly in an annexe alongside police officers and experts who couldn’t fit into the main room. At the retrial, up to 30 people crowded around the courtroom door each morning, jostling to be allowed in. Court ushers did their best to maintain order, asking them to move aside to allow the baby’s family, police officers and journalists in, but then they were allowed to take their places in the public gallery. Katie, Leah and Richard were in court throughout the first trial and came back for the second. They’ve asked for their names to be changed because they say they’ve felt intimidated by some of the people who’ve turned up this time around. “People come literally from all over, we've had people come from the USA and Brazil,” Katie says. “They’re not interested in listening to the arguments - they just want to be in that court,"" Leah adds. “Then halfway through they’re trying to get up and leave because they realise it's quite dry, it's quite tedious.” They maintain it’s important for members of the public to be allowed to observe trials. Richard, who had never been to one before, says he committed his time to following the Letby trial because of its complexity. “To really understand the case, I think you have to be there to listen to it and absorb as much of it as you can.” Not everyone was there to listen carefully. A man handing out flyers about judicial corruption was asked to leave. Court ushers had to remind someone else not to record the hearing. And there was shouting and tears when competing views were aired outside in the corridor. But if the lack of decorum inside the courthouse felt new, it was as nothing compared with the invective raging online. Reporters and even witnesses found themselves being trolled and accused of bias and dishonesty. There were two battles – the traditional courtroom duel of prosecution v defence; and the information war going on in parallel. Where will this all end up? “I’m not guilty of what I’ve been found guilty of,” Letby said at her retrial. But having been denied permission to appeal, she’d have to come up with startling new evidence or arguments to have a chance of overturning her convictions. That won’t stop the debate though. There could be further criminal prosecutions – Cheshire Police is still investigating Letby’s career. And the public inquiry, which starts in September, will examine the wider fallout, interrogating hospital managers about the way they handled doctors’ concerns. We watched Letby as closely during her retrial as we had throughout the 10 months of the first prosecution. She was readier to catch our eye – looking up at the public gallery, and glancing across to where the baby’s family was sitting. She often blinked rapidly and clutched a furry stress-toy under the desk of the witness box. When she gave evidence, she spoke in the same neutral, clipped tone as before, betraying little emotion. These were intriguing little details, but they seemed to conceal more than they revealed. Even after two trials, questions about the nurse’s character, motive and psychology are still unanswered.  Lucy Letby remains an enigma. This is a distressing case, so if you - or someone you know - need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c727jgdm7r4o,"Judith Moritz and Jonathan Coffey,",2024-07-04 01:39:20,Unknown
16,"Project 2025: The Trump presidency wish list, explained","President Joe Biden's Democrats are mobilising against a possible governing agenda for Donald Trump if he is elected this November. The blueprint, called Project 2025 and produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, is one of several think-tank proposals for Trump’s platform. Over more than 900 pages, it calls for sacking thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education and other federal agencies, and sweeping tax cuts. The Heritage Foundation unveiled its agenda in April last year, and liberal opposition ramped up as former President Trump has taken a lead in polls after President Biden's poor debate performance.  On Wednesday, Heritage president Kevin Roberts raised the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview. “We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump advisor Steve Bannon. The remarks prompted pushback from the Biden campaign, which accused Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America"". The comments have renewed attention on the Project 2025 document.  It is common for Washington DC think tanks to propose policy wish lists for potential governments-in-waiting. The liberal Center for American Progress, for example, was dubbed Barack Obama’s “ideas factory” during his presidency. But Democrats have taken aim at the Heritage paper, seeking to get campaign value out of some of its more drastic measures.  Last month, Congressman Jared Huffman of California announced a Stop Project 2025 Task Force. Mr Huffman said: “Project 2025 is more than an idea, it's a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will. “We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.” Heritage has previously said Mr Biden’s party was scaremongering with “an unserious, mistake-riddled press release”. “House Democrats are dedicating taxpayer dollars to launch a smear campaign against the united effort to restore self-governance to everyday Americans,” said Mr Roberts in an early June statement.  “Under the Biden administration, the federal government has been weaponized against American citizens, our border invaded, and our institutions captured by woke ideology.” The Project 2025 document outlines four main aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation’s sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely. It is one of several policy papers for a platform broadly known as Agenda 47 - so-called because Trump would be America's 47th president if he won. Heritage says Project 2025 was written by several former Trump appointees and reflects input from more than 100 conservative organisations. Here’s an outline of several key proposals. Project 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control – a controversial idea known as “unitary executive theory”. In practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas. The proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government-employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees. The document labels the FBI a “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization” and calls for drastic overhauls of this and other federal agencies, including eliminating the Department of Education.  Increased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border – one of Trump’s signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.  However, more prominent are the consolidation of various US immigration agencies and a large expansion in their powers.   Other proposals include increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.  The document proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas”.  Carbon-reduction goals would be replaced by efforts to increase energy production and security. The paper sets out two competing visions on tariffs, and is divided on whether the next president should try to boost free trade or raise barriers to exports. But the economic advisers suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency. Project 2025 does not call for a nationwide abortion ban. However, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market. Under the proposals, pornography would be banned, and tech and telecoms companies that facilitate access to such content would be shut down. The document calls for school choice and parental control over schools, and takes aim at what it calls “woke propaganda”. It proposes to eliminate a long list of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including “sexual orientation"", “diversity, equity, and inclusion”, “gender equality”, ""abortion"" and “reproductive rights”. The Heritage Foundation is one of the most influential of a number of think tanks that has produced policy papers designed to guide a possible second Trump presidency. Since the 1980s, Heritage has produced similar policy documents as part of its Mandate for Leadership series. Project 2025, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget, also sets out strategies for implementing policies beginning immediately after the presidential inauguration in January 2025. Trump has endorsed a number of the Project 2025 ideas in his speeches and on his website, although his campaign has said the candidate has the final say on policy. Many of the proposals would face immediate legal challenges if implemented.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do,"Mike Wendling,",2024-07-03 21:39:20,Unknown
15,Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups,"A purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification. Such mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest. Queensland is home to one of the country’s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice. The clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions. One in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive. An inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state’s health ombudsman this week found “systemic issues” concerning “quality and safety” and “safeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children”. The report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had “ identification and traceability” issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards. It also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers. The body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards. “The impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,” the report concluded, adding that “appropriate counselling should be offered” by fertility providers. It is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed ""thousands"" frozen before 2020 as ""high risk” because they “did not comply with double witnessing” - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient’s material has been labelled correctly. Anastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland’s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was “horrified [but] not surprised” by the ombudsman’s findings. “It is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm. “Why were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans? The effects of these errors last for generations,” she added.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngl45jz1zo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-03 11:39:20,Unknown
19,Ellen DeGeneres cancels four comedy stand-up dates,"US broadcaster and comic Ellen DeGeneres has cancelled four dates on her stand-up comedy tour. ""Unfortunately, the event organiser has had to cancel your event,"" said a note on Ticketmaster's website, listing shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago  as the ones affected. It is unclear why the dates have been dropped as other dates in those cities are still going ahead. The tour is currently scheduled to run until 17 August. It marks her return to the spotlight two years after the cancellation of  the Ellen DeGeneres talk show, after employees accused executive producers over ""toxic workplace"" claims. Three producers were fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment and DeGeneres apologised on air, but in May 2021 she announced the show would end the following year, after 19 seasons.  In April, she opened the first night of Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour by saying: ""I didn't care what other people thought of me, and I realised... I said that at the height of my popularity"". DeGeneres told the Los Angeles crowd she had been doing lots of gardening since the show ended and collecting chickens as pets - adding that as a former talk show host she appreciated the pressure of having to lay an egg each day. ""What else can I tell you?"" she added. ""Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business. There's no mean people in show business."" The stand-up show will be released on Netflix, which broadcast her previous stand-up gig, Relatable, in 2018. DeGeneres' TV career began with her popular sitcom Ellen in 1994, in which she played the owner of a book shop. In her opening gig, she referenced her talk show being cancelled after she came out as gay.  “For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business… Eventually they’re going to kick me out for a third time because I’m mean, old, and gay,"" she said.  She also said that having been in the public for so long, the takedown she experienced has ""been such a toll on my ego and my-self esteem"". ""There's such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolise you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder,"" she added. Her her talk show began in 2003 and grew in popularity; in 2016 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.  The BBC has contacted DeGeneres' representatives for comment.

13,"In Marseille, pétanque masks political divides ahead of Sunday's vote","First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause. On a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France’s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of pétanque. And this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World Pétanque Championships – an annual televised event held on France’s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation’s unexpected parliamentary elections. “The show must go on. Pétanque must go on. Smiling must go on,” said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships. “France is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It’s an international sport,” Astier enthused. Around her, in the dappled shade of the park’s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action. “I lost yesterday,” said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug. But even here, the discordant clamour of France’s polarised politics sometimes broke through. “Fachos,” - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France’s parliament. “I support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,” countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille’s high crime rate. “It’s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,” he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union. In Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) – the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France’s parliamentary elections last week – have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as “phantom candidates”. But their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online. “We’re the last bastion against chaos,” candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X. ""Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,” Gisèle Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site. With its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond. In recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round. “Macron… is not popular here at all,” said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president’s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up. Rof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people’s legitimate concerns about crime. “The basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It’s out in the open,” he said. Much of the crime is linked to Marseille’s powerful drug gangs, which operate – often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city. In a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage. “Front Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!” people chanted, naming France’s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy. Mr Kessaci’s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020.  He said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority. “This election… is a rendezvous with history. The extremists are at the gates of power. [If RN wins] it will be chaos, like what you had in Germany in the 1930s,"" he said.  ""We need to stop them waging a war against the poor, a war against foreigners. We need to tackle the drug traffickers and help the marginalised.  ""The far right have no plan, they just have anger. My parents chose this country and I’m a Frenchman,” the young candidate said, before racing off to meet the deadline to submit his application to run in the second-round vote.",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl4y7x7vmx5o,"Andrew Harding,",2024-07-03 23:39:20,Unknown
12,'Something needs to happen' - Democratic voters on replacing Biden,"In the days since President Joe Biden's widely-criticised debate performance against former president Donald Trump, Democrats across the country have begun questioning whether Mr Biden is the best candidate for the party.  Most voters think Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden isn’t the nominee, a CNN poll found this week.  The BBC spoke to Democratic voters who reflected that concern but who also worried about the logistics of switching candidates this far into the campaign. As the party confronts this thorny question, we asked voters what they want to see Democrats do next and who they think could replace Mr Biden. Familiar names include Vice-President Kamala Harris, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.  We start with a voter who feels the Democratic party is not listening to its constituents and wants a fresh face atop the ticket in place of Mr Biden.  Silvia feels like the Democratic party isn't listening to her; she wants Biden to step aside and a new candidate to take centre stage.  They give us these text messages ""Are you going to support President Biden for re-election?"" and I said ""no"". I don't want someone who doesn't have the ability to continue in office for a very long time.   I'm just tired.  They push who they think is going to get elected without listening to our voices.  We want someone younger, we want someone who has new ideas, has new ways to engage the whole country. But at the same time, what do I do now?  He should step aside.  I'm hoping we get someone fresh, but I don't know who.  Other candidates don't get the air time, so I have to do my own research.  I want someone new. I wish he would step down. I wish he would recognize as president, you're the president of the people. Listen to the people, listen to us.  I definitely have been watching the governor of Michigan [Whitmer]. I think we need a woman as president and that's who I would like on a ticket.  Kyle worries the Democratic party has no game plan and is dismissing voters' concerns about Biden's abilities.  I think there has to be a serious discussion about Biden stepping down...  In the end, it's up to Joe Biden, but I think at very least, there should be some other candidates floated to be able to to articulate what our our game plan is going forward... I think the more the party tries to tell the public to not believe what we saw during that debate, it's going to take me from believing we should maybe just deal with Biden to we need a change.  A lot of Democratic voters feel gas lit.  We're being asked to not believe what we saw, and being told that this is a one off, and we know that this is not a one-off.  There's been a lot that's been accomplished, but if we can't articulate those messages, we can't win, which means that vision ceases to continue. The president - they affect down ballot races, and those down ballot races could mean catastrophe with what's at stake in this election. Gretchen Whitmer would be an excellent example of someone who could replace Biden, or Pete Buttigieg, but I think at this stage, it's difficult to say.  But I think a Whitmer-Buttigieg ticket could win.  We need people and Democratic candidates who are from Midwestern states or other states who know how to communicate a little bit better with people in their constituencies.  This voter thinks Biden never should have run for this second term, but he is concerned that it is too late in the process to replace Biden.  On the one hand, I personally wouldn't mind him stepping down, but that does lead me to a lot of scepticism that whoever replaces him as the nominee would have the capabilities and momentum to beat Trump.  It is a tough question of who could replace Biden.  Realistically, I don't think my policy positions totally align with VP [Kamala] Harris, but I do think that, honestly, she'd probably be the best choice for president in terms of logistics, in terms of name recognition.  If he were to step down, she's the clear successor. She's already part of the ticket.  That said, I think if we could go back in time and rerun the primary system and actually have a proper voting primary with a field of candidates, I'd probably be more likely to lean towards someone who has a bit more support in the midwest and rust belt states. Someone like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.  Joshua thinks the Democrats have to make a change because he says Biden is not the best candidate to beat Trump come November.  Something needs to happen.  The Democrats need to have a moment of, ""hey, this is what we did wrong"". Let's have a conversation about if Biden is truly viable or not.  Is he the best to beat Trump now?  I don't think anyone can confidently say he is.  Possibly Gavin Newsom is. He's primed himself as the best alternative, knowing that this opportunity would come up.  If he runs, he's just a name that people can get behind. He has a face that people like. He has a great family. I just don't know another name in the Democratic Party who, at this stage of the race, could catch up.  Gavin Newsom, who has primed himself to be in that position, or [Pennsylvania Governor] Josh Shapiro, who is an underdog that can really get there. This voter, who is a progressive Democrat, would love to see Biden replaced on the Democratic ticket but worries that it's too late.  I'm conflicted.  Personally, yes, I think Biden should step down, but realistically and logistically, no - the primary is done.  He has won the Democratic nomination, even though participation in the primaries for an incumbent president is more of a formality. You have other candidates, like Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker, Harris, who could technically be good candidates to replace him, but the plan should have been put in place years ago, if not a year ago, in my opinion.  Yeah, I would personally like to see Biden replaced, but I don't see how that would logistically happen. I would like to see Pritzker on the ticket.  It seems to me that Newsom is the heir apparent, but I would say Pritzker and maybe Harris, or Harris-Pritzker. Pritzker has a more progressive policy that he's enacted in Illinois that could expand as a vision for the rest of the country. Biden's done a good job as president, and I think his legacy as a decent one-term caretaker president is at risk by trying to hold on to power. His legacy is absolutely in the gutter if he loses to Trump, in a landslide, which seems to be a possibility. If there were a singular candidate Democrats could coalesce around, Leslie would get behind them. Without one, she thinks replacing Biden is off the table.  It's too late. We're too close to the election to have a switch. If there was a single person that everyone could immediately get behind, maybe. But I don't think that person exists right now.  I think if Kamala Harris came in, there'd be all these people complaining about her. Or if Pete Buttigieg came in, people complaining about him. So I think right now, where we are right now, I think it's too late to switch. If Biden were to drop out, I like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Kamala Harris has the most name recognition, so I like her quite a lot, but I know that she also turns a lot of people off. I would worry that she would cause people not to show up to vote, but I guess I would support her. Jessica doesn't know how the Democrats can come back from Joe Biden's debate performance without replacing him.  I want to see him replaced. I feel guilty or bad saying that or thinking that. If Joe Biden stays in the race, I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  But I don't see how he can come back from that debate performance.  There are a lot of people who folks would be genuinely excited to vote for and I think now it's really a feeling of dread.  Gretchen Whitmer is a name that has been thrown around who I think would be great. Josh Shapiro is wonderful.  Those are two that come to mind who I think people would be excited about.  I'd be excited to vote for Josh Shapiro, I'd be excited to vote for Gretchen Whitmer, I'd be excited to vote for Gavin Newsom.  I don't even know a ton about Gavin Newsom, but from what I do know, I think there would be a level of excitement just knowing we have somebody other than Joe Biden who is qualified and capable and dynamic and decades younger.

11,"Chess star, 9, to become youngest England player","A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport. Bodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women’s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year. She is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao.  ""I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,""  Bodhana told the BBC. ""I was happy. I hope I’ll do well, and I’ll get another title.""  Malcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen. ""It’s exciting - she’s on course to be one of the best British players ever,"" he said.  However the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from.  ""I’m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I’m not good at chess,” he told the BBC. ""I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.""  Bodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic. ""When one of my dad’s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],” Bodhana said. ""There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing."" She says chess makes her feel ""good"" and helps her with ""lots of other things like maths, how to calculate"".  Two years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes. As for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously.  ""On school days I practice for around one hour every day,” she said. ""On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don’t I practice for more than an hour."" While some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent.  The game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen’s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player. Mr Pein says he feels ""very confident"" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess.  Abhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12. But Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g6e653wrlo,"Will Vernon,",2024-07-03 17:39:20,Unknown
10,Revered screenwriter Robert Towne dies aged 89,"Robert Towne, who wrote films including Chinatown and Mission: Impossible, has been remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters following his death at the age of 89. Towne won an Oscar for his 1974 crime and corruption thriller Chinatown, which starred Jack Nicholson as a private detective. He was nominated for four Oscars during his career in total, including for co-writing 1975's Shampoo with the film's star Warren Beatty. Lee Grant, who won best supporting actress for her role in that film, paid tribute to Towne on X. ""His life, like the characters he created, was incisive, iconoclastic & entirely originally [sic],"" she wrote. ""He gave me the gift of Shampoo. He gave all of us the gift of his words & his films. There isn’t another like him. There won’t be again."" Towne also had a high reputation as a script doctor, fixing or adding to existing scripts, such as 1967's Bonnie and Clyde and 1972's The Godfather. Towne often didn't get an official credit, but The Godfather's writer-director Francis Ford Coppola used his Oscars best adapted screenplay acceptance speech to thank him for writing a pivotal and ""very beautiful"" scene between Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's characters in a garden. ""That was Bob Towne's scene,"" Coppola told the 1973 award ceremony. Towne also earned his own Oscar nominations for writing 1973's The Last Detail - also starring Nicholson - and 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. However, he had handed over writing duties on Greystoke and disliked the results so much that he took his name off the credits and used the pseudonym PH Vazak instead. Vazak was the name of his Hungarian sheepdog. Towne had no such qualms about Chinatown, but did admit to having fierce rows with director Roman Polanski throughout the writing and filming process. ""We fought every day, over everything,"" he said. Scott Tobias wrote in the Guardian last month: ""There has been no greater original screenplay in the last 50 years than the one Robert Towne wrote for Chinatown. ""None more elegantly plotted and politically charged, none more literate and historically evocative, none more pungent in its hard-bitten dialogue and sophisticated in its play on noir archetypes."" In 2006, Chinatown was ranked third on a Writers Guild of America list of the greatest screenplays ever - ahead of The Godfather in second and Casablanca in first, meaning Towne had at least a hand in two of the top three. In 2017, Vulture placed him at number three on its list of the best screenwriters of all time. Following his death, the American Film Institute wrote on X: ""From writing masterpieces like Chinatown, Shampoo & countless others, his influence is everlasting.""

14,Hurricane Beryl: A record-breaking sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 11:39:20,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 10:53:20,Unknown
30,Foden 'feels sorry' for under-pressure Southgate,"This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? England forward Phil Foden has said the players ""need to take some of the blame"" for the team's performances at Euro 2024 and that he ""feels sorry"" for under-pressure manager Gareth Southgate. Southgate's side reached the knockout stages of the tournament by finishing top of their group before beating Slovakia after extra time in the last 16. However, the manner of their play has been criticised with questions asked about team selection and tactics.  “The players have got to take some of the blame,” said Foden. “There has to be some leaders to get together and find out a solution to why it is not working.  ""There is only so much the manager can do. He sets you up in a system and tells you how to press. If it is not going like that, you have to [work it out].” When asked about the pressure on Southgate during the tournament and going into Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland (17:00 BST), the Manchester City player added: “I feel sorry for Gareth. “In training, he has been telling us to press and be high up on the pitch and I feel like sometimes, it has to come from the players. “We have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution. “So yes,  we have spoken about it more. If it happens again in a game, we can get together and find a solution, see where it is going wrong and adapt our press.” Switzerland next on the BBC - England's path in Euros Toney 'annoyed' at lack of Euro 2024 game time Five reasons to be positive about England Foden was the Premier League's Player of the Season and was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for the 2023-24 campaign as he helped City win the top-flight title. However, he has yet to score at Euro 2024 and has struggled to replicate his Premier League form in Germany. “I’ve not been the best player in the Premier League to come here and not show it,” the 24-year-old said. “[But] every game I’m moving little steps forward and, hopefully, I can put in good performances for England. That’s always been my aim to show it for the national team. “The first game was very quiet, in terms of how the game went I didn’t have much going forward for myself.  ""The next games after that I grew. I came close a few times and  I was offside [when seeming to score] in the last game [against Slovakia]. Against Denmark I hit the post.  ""My performances have improved a lot and if [the efforts] go in no-one’s saying anything.” Foden also rejected the view that when he drifts inside from the left he occupies too similar a position to midfielder Jude Bellingham. “I don’t agree with that, I feel we do work good together,” he said. “It’s just the way the games have gone sometimes and the way football works, [but] I feel like in the last game we did build on it really well, in terms of keeping the ball.

28,Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning,"Chasing the 'Ghost' - a superstar struck down by lightning North London is humid and Rob White is tired. ""We had ridiculous storms here last night,"" he says. ""I woke up at 4am and it was like someone switching a neon light on and off in my room. ""Even at the age of 60, that takes me somewhere."" White is aware of the cliche. ""The clap of thunder, the flash of lightning, it is almost lazy as a plot device isn't it?"" he says. ""You see it in movies, in books, in plays - it goes all the way back to Greek tragedy."" But for his story, it is undeniable and unavoidable. Every bolt lands in the same place: 21 July 1964. Sixty years ago, a summer storm erupted over Middlesex and lightning struck a lone golfer. John White, 27, was found crouched and scorched under a tree, the rings on his fingers fused to the shaft of the club he was clutching. Tottenham and Scotland had lost one of the finest footballers of his generation - a Double winner, with a European Cup Winners' Cup medal to his name - at the height of his powers. Rob, just six months old at the time, had lost a father. His search has continued ever since. Pat Jennings (front, far right) and Jimmy Greaves (behind Jennings) attend White's funeral on 25 July 1964 Rob has spent his life trying to unravel a death and reveal its victim, listening at closed doors and investigating sliding doors. The day he knows best in his father's life is the last. It is one littered with chance encounters and alternate universes, any of which would have led John out of a lightning bolt's path. On the fateful morning of 21 July 1964, Tottenham's players gathered for some team photos and gentle pre-season training at White Hart Lane. Having finished in the top four in seven of the previous eight seasons, they were an established power, with an attack centred on Jimmy Greaves' finishing and Cliff Jones' trickery. John White's gifts were more subtle. He  had a silken first touch, an astute passing game and an ability to lose his marker that, combined with his slight frame and pale complexion, earned him the nickname 'the Ghost'. Bill Nicholson knew John's value. Having lost Dave Mackay to a broken leg and captain Danny Blanchflower to retirement, the manager had told John that his next Tottenham team would be built around him. White (far right) in action in the 1962 FA Cup final against Burnley. His Tottenham side retained the FA Cup with a 3-1 win in front of 100,000 spectators That was all to come, though. This wasn't the time of year for serious business. After training, barely blowing, John stripped down to his vest and pants to take on team-mate Terry Medwin in an indoor tennis match, rather than head straight home. When John returned to the dressing room, he was confused. His trousers were missing.  Ten minutes before, a smiling Jones had driven out of White Hart Lane, waving them out of his car window in glee at a well-executed prank. John eventually found a pair to borrow, finally returned home and, despite the day drawing on, said he was going to play golf. His young wife Sandra, juggling Rob and his two-year-old sister, suggested he shouldn't. They argued. Delay heaped on delay. The sky darkened. A compromise was found. Sandra dropped John off at Crews Hill golf course. He headed into the club shop and bought a pack of three balls. As he left, he bumped into Tony Marchi, another Tottenham team-mate. Having asked about for a playing partner at training earlier in the day, John asked for a final time. Did Tony fancy playing with him? ""As far as we know, that was the last conversation my father had,"" says Rob. ""The last thing that Tony thought as he watched my dad go out was: 'John is going to get really wet out there this afternoon.'"" Marchi, having played his own round already, opted against joining John. The final sliding door shut. John walked out another and on to the course. ""I know that Tony [who died in 2022] always wished he could have just had another paragraph of conversation with my dad,"" says Rob. ""Because if he had, my dad wouldn't have been in that place at that time."" The White family in 1964, with two-year-old Mandy sitting on John's knee and a young Rob, wearing one of John's Scotland caps, being held by Sandra The landlord emerges from behind a curtain, cigarette in mouth, thinning hair slicked back, and nonchalantly hands out a collection of pistols to the suited young men on the other side of the bar. Each handles them with awed reverence, spinning the barrels and staring down the sights. At one point, one of young men, blonde and slight, takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and blows his nose. And all the time, an unseen Pathe newsreader chatters away over the top. It is a film from 1962 – a different time when top-flight footballers would be little more than extras in a news report about a gun-collecting publican in north London., external John White and his team-mates played their parts well, looking on in due awe as their host spun a gun on his finger and slotting it back into his holster. For Rob, the footage is part of a patchwork he has been stitching together over the past 60 years. The first pieces came when, aged nine, he sneaked up into the attic of the family home and opened up a cardboard box. ""It was like Tutankhamun's tomb - it had scrapbooks, newspapers, programmes, boots, medals, a couple of Scotland caps, a shaving kit that smelt of Old Spice,"" Rob says. ""As a kid, I would sneak up into the loft and essentially grieve and get really quite sad looking at this stuff. ""It was as if my Dad was one of those wire mannequins that sculptors might use; I knew 'the Ghost', that my dad was something, but finding this stuff allowed me to put texture on that outline."" White and Greaves celebrate an FA Cup final victory at Wembley Just as on the pitch though, tracking down John was not easy. Rob's mother Sandra could remember driving up to the course to pick up her husband, seeing the clubhouse surrounded with police cars and then, such was the shock, little else from the next five years of her life. In the wake of John's death, the sideboard trophies, celebratory photos and any trace of his existence were tidied away. In their place, a culture of stoicism, silence and secrecy dominated. His father was rarely spoken about – a subject too sore for anyone to know how to handle. ""Most families have a story that as a kid you don't know the full details of, but you know never to ask about,"" says Rob. ""Maybe you are told something once, or a door is half-open and you hear something. You can't quite piece it together, but, as humans, we create our own narrative, filling in the gaps with information that may, or may not, be right."" For Rob, there was plenty of information to fill in the gaps. John's life was documented in an uncommon depth for his era. People shared hundreds of photos, thousands of memories and the odd piece of footage. Usually the film was match action, but occasionally it was something rarer and, in many ways, more precious – an afternoon John spent in a pub with its eccentric landlord and a Pathe film crew for instance. Tottenham players at their 1962 Christmas party with Tony Marchi (far left), Jimmy Greaves (centre), Dave Mackay (third from right) and John White (second from right) Too often, though, the character lacked depth: as thin as the page of the comic he seemed to spring from. ""He was this kind of Roy of the Rovers figure and as I got older I got frustrated and almost embarrassed by people having a better knowledge of my dad than I did,"" Rob says. ""Part of the joy of having a father is finding our own identity - there is a little blueprint there and if we are lucky we follow the good bits and jettison the bad bits - but I didn't have that. ""There is still a kid in me that wants to know the simple stuff: what he smelt like and sounded like, a bit more about him, rather than this persona. That is the eternal frustration."" Rob channelled that frustration into a book - The Ghost of White Hart Lane - interviewing family members, former team-mates, friends and acquaintances, to try and discover the man behind the myth. And gradually he found him. Rob heard about the sadness and homesickness that would grip John each winter in London. He heard about the time he drove home dangerously drunk, clipping the White Hart Lane gates in his car. Most revealingly, an uncle told Rob about the child that John had fathered in Scotland and left behind before he travelled south, played for Spurs and met Sandra. ""Part of me has always been trying to live up to this person who was absolutely perfect, who was idolised not just by the family, but by hundreds of thousands of people,"" says Rob. ""To find out he had defects and weaknesses, that he struggled with confidence, mental health and seasonal affective disorder, that he had made mistakes - if I had found all that out earlier, it would have made more sense to my life. ""If we know our parents are fallible, it really makes us understand that we can make mistakes. We don't have to know all the answers."" John's absence shaped Rob as surely as his presence would have. Rob is a still-life photographer - ""I have always been looking for those details and clues"" - and is also training as a counsellor. Later this month, Rob will be in the audience at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first performance of a play, called The Ghost of White Hart Lane, that he commissioned about his father's life.  The staging is intended to share his father's story to several generations of fans who remember neither John's life or death.  ""It is something I talk about with my own therapist,"" he says. ""Having seen life breathed into the story at the play's read-throughs, it reinforced the reasons I wanted to get involved with the project. ""I think there is something of trying to bring my dad back to life."" After two nights in Tottenham, the play will then transfer north, taking the opposite journey to the one John took in life, for a stint at the Edinburgh Festival., external There are some things that remain lost. Rob is still searching for a recording of John's voice. One of his match-worn Tottenham shirts remains elusive. But over the decades, he has found much more: an understanding and an empathy for the father he never knew.

27,Anderson's record-breaking career - in his own words,"James Anderson has taken 700 Test wickets - more than any other pace bowler in Test cricket history James Anderson will end his record-breaking England career after the first Test against West Indies at Lord’s next week. In a special episode of the Tailenders podcast, Anderson spoke at length about his cricketing life for the first time since he announced he will retire from internationals. This is James Anderson, in his own words. Anderson’s father, Michael, was the second-team captain at Burnley Cricket Club, where James was first introduced to the game. Anderson himself says he was “OK at batting and bowling”, until one winter when things began to change. I do remember the time I became able to bowl quicker, but not the specific moment it happened. At 15, I came back to winter nets at a school in Blackburn and it was coming out a lot quicker. I don't really know why or how that happened, but it did. My best mate David Brown, his dad Peter - I can't remember what shot he played - but I remember the bat breaking. I broke a couple of bats that winter and I felt horrific. I felt like something different had happened. I can't put my finger on why. People were excited. The captain at the time would say: ""Just bowl as fast as you can."" Because it was such a change in pace and my body was still developing, I didn't really know where the ball was going and I bowled the odd beamer. I beamed Australia batter Brad Hodge, who was playing for Ramsbottom. He sort of punched it off his face. I can't repeat what he said and I was so apologetic. In the first over of a game at Burnley I bowled four wides in a row and was thinking ""oh my god, this is painful"" - then the next ball went straight through the batter and bowled him. It was inconsistent and erratic, but fun. This video can not be played James Anderson tries to name all the England captain's he's played for Anderson famously made his England debut as a 20-year-old in a one-day international in Australia in 2002, called up after a spate of injuries to senior fast bowlers, just over a year after his Lancashire debut. I've heard Nasser Hussain's dad had seen me play Championship cricket and said I might be worth a look. I got a phone call and was told England wanted me to join them in Sydney. So many questions go through your head but, in reality, I was thinking: ""Am I really going to play?"" I didn't play the first game in Sydney and then we went to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and I got told on the outfield I was playing the next day by Nasser. I was thinking: ""I'm just going enjoy this while I'm here, because it might not last. I might never play again."" Nasser was quite intense as a captain and a lot of people didn't like the way he went about things. But for me, as a 20-year-old, I needed that firmness and instruction. He would really tell you what was demanded of you. He probably had the biggest influence on me, just because of the stage of my career I was at when I played under him.  We had most success under Andrew Strauss, but I don't know whether that was down to his captaincy or just the group of players that we had. Probably more so the group of players. James Anderson made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2003 alongside Anthony McGrath Anderson's early England career was troublesome - he played only one Test between August 2004 and March 2006 as he battled tweaks to his action and a stress fracture in his back. Troy Cooley, the bowling coach at the time, was into biomechanics. We had a net session with dots put on us, cameras filming in order to see what the bones were doing in the bowling action. My spine was like an S shape. They thought I was going to get injured and I could bowl quicker, even though I was bowling 90mph when I first came into the team. They reckon they could have got me up to 95 if I just changed my action a little bit. I got injured after changing my action and I didn't bowl great for 12 months straight after that period. They weren't trying to damage me, they did it for the best of me and the team. I was at the point where I didn't think I would play for England again. My wife Danielle was amazing. She said: ""Snap out of it, you are definitely good enough.""  When I got fit again, I went to Mike Watkinson at Lancashire and Kevin Shine, who was the new England bowling coach, and they said I should go back to my old action. The rest is history. This video can not be played James Anderson looks back on his favourite career wicket for England. Anderson will end on 188 Test caps, the most of any England player and the second-highest of all-time. From those, he picked the first Ashes Test against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2013 as his favourite, when Anderson claimed 10 wickets as part of a heart-stopping 14-run win. It's the best game I've had for England. An Ashes Test, the close nature and I bowled a 13-over spell on the last day trying to bowl them out. I used all the skills I could possibly think of, everything I had in my armoury. The last wicket, Brad Haddin, was an off-cutter. I didn't actually hear the nick, but Alastair Cook and Matt Prior behind the stumps heard it and then the umpire gave it not out. We had to review it and I asked Haddin if he hit it and he said he did, so we all knew it was going to be given out, but there's still that moment when the decision comes up on the big screen and the umpire puts his finger up. It was just incredible. There's a great photo of all 11 of us, starting to charge off like a like a flock of geese, running around the ground. It was amazing. The wickets that matter are the ones where you influence games. Contributing to a win like that is the best feeling. This video can not be played England's James Anderson on things he would like to have done during his career Anderson, one the most complete fast bowlers to ever play the game, described the evolution of skills that have kept him improving across a 21-year Test career, along with a couple of regrets. In Test cricket, when you have to bowl in so many different conditions around the world, you need so many different skills and I've tried to develop as many as I can. The biggest one that helped me was being able to bowl an in-swinger to a right-hander and an out-swinger to a left-hander. My record when I couldn't bowl that to left-handers is really poor, but I started learning the in-swinger and it took me about four years to feel confident to bowl it in a game. It just gave me a completely different approach to left-handers, in particular bowling round the wicket. Just for bragging rights in the pub, I wish I had taken a Test hat-trick. Stuart Broad bangs on about his two quite a lot and he'll always have that on me. I never got a Test hundred either and I was so close at Trent Bridge. I made 81 against India in 2014. I thought I was getting one there, but I didn't make it. Pat Cummins has taken 269 Test wickets at an average of 22.53 Anderson was asked which attributes would make the perfect bowler. In answering he revealed his admiration for Australia captain and Ashes rival Pat Cummins. You would pick Glenn McGrath's accuracy and Dale Steyn's wrist position. Being a Lancashire fan, I always loved Wasim Akram's action. He was an insane bowler. He swung it both ways and reversed it really well. I really like Pat Cummins' action. There was a Test match in Galle in Sri Lanka where I was feeling really stiff after lunch. Mark Wood was at mid-off and I said: ""I'm going to copy Pat Cummins' action now and try to bowl like him."" I got a wicket in that over and Woody said: ""You should bowl like him all the time."" He's got an amazing snap. When he gets to the top of his action, everything seems to go really quick. When he bowls the ball, he just snaps through the crease. Because I was feeling stiff and a bit sluggish, I was trying to recreate that speed and it worked. James Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since 2017 alongside Greg James, Felix White and Matt Horan Anderson has been part of the Tailenders podcast since it was launched in 2017. He has worked as a TV and radio pundit, and a newspaper columnist. Following his final Test, he will immediately join the England coaching team as a bowling mentor. He is yet to announce if he will continue to play for Lancashire. I've loved doing Tailenders. It definitely made me fall back in love with the game because at some points it has become just a job. There are some days when you turn up, it's raining and the covers are on and I wasn't actually that bothered. I honestly don't know what will happen next. I love talking about the game. I love talking about bowling and delving into the technical side of it. I've done a bit of punditry on TV and on the radio, so I will maybe balance that and a bit of coaching. It's a weird feeling when you've done something for 20 years and then all of a sudden you've got to find something else to do. We went to see a school for my eldest daughter the other day. There was a careers adviser there and I did wonder about asking him some questions. I'd like a bit of time just to try a few things and see if something sticks.

24,Jeff Bezos to sell another $5bn of Amazon shares,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he will sell another 25 million shares in the technology giant, worth nearly $5bn (£3.9bn). It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off. Mr Bezos stepped down as the company's chief executive in 2021 and is currently its executive chair and remains its largest shareholder. He founded Amazon in 1994 in a garage in Bellevue, Washington, when the internet was still in its infancy. The company started out as an online bookseller, touting the world's largest collection of ebooks. Since then Amazon has become one of the world's leading online retail and cloud computing companies.

22,World's oldest cave art found showing humans and pig,"The oldest example of figurative cave art has been discovered in the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi by Australian and Indonesian scientists. The painting of a wild pig and three human-like figures is at least 51,200 years old, more than 5,000 years older than the previous oldest cave art. The discovery pushes back the time that modern humans first showed the capacity for creative thought. Prof Maxime Aubert from Griffith University in Australia told BBC News that the discovery would change ideas about human evolution. “The painting tells a complex story. It is the oldest evidence we have for storytelling. It shows that humans at the time had the capacity to think in abstract terms,” he said. The painting shows a pig standing still with its mouth partly open and at least three human-like figures.  The largest human figure has both arms extended and appears to be holding a rod. The second is immediately in front of the pig with its head next to its snout. It also seems to be holding a stick, one end of which may be in contact with the pig’s throat. The last human-like figure seems to be upside-down with its legs facing up and splayed outwards. It has one hand reaching towards and seemingly touching the pig’s head. The team of scientists was led by Adhi Agus Oktaviana, an Indonesian rock art specialist from the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) in Jakarta. He says that that narrative storytelling was a crucial part of early human culture in Indonesia from a very early point in time. “Humans have probably been telling stories for much longer than 51,200 years, but as words do not fossilise we can only go by indirect proxies like depictions of scenes in art – and the Sulawesi art is now the oldest such evidence by far that is known to archaeology,” he said. The first evidence for drawing were found on rocks in the Blombos Caves in southern Africa and dates back to between 75,000 to 100,000 years ago. These consist of geometric patterns.  The new painting, in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang in the Maros-Pangkep region of South Sulawesi, shows representational art – an abstract representation of the world around the person or people that painted it.  It therefore represents an evolution in the thought processes in our species that gave rise to art and science. The question is what triggered this awakening of the human mind, according to Dr Henry Gee, who is a senior editor at the journal Nature, where the details were published. “Something seems to have happened around 50,000 years ago, shortly after which all other species of human such as Neanderthals and the so-called Hobbit died out.  “It is very romantic to think that at some point in that time something happened in the human brain, but I think it is more likely that there are even earlier examples of representational art”. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London believes that there may be examples of ancient representational art in Africa, where modern humans first evolved, but we have not found any yet. “This find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread. “If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge. Obviously this oldest date is work on one panel at one site - hopefully more dating will be done at more sites to confirm this apparently crucial finding”. The new dating was made possible using a new method which involves cutting tiny amounts of the art using a laser. This enables researchers to study different parts of the artwork in greater detail and come up with a more accurate dating. As the new method becomes more widely used, several sites with cave art across the world may be re-dated, possibly pushing back further the emergence of representational art. Until 10 years ago, the only evidence of ancient cave art was found in places such as Spain and Southern France.  It led some to believe that the creative explosion that led to the art and science we know today began in Europe. But the discovery of coloured outlines of human hands in South Suluwesi in 2014 shattered that view Then in November 2018, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh  on the Indonesian Island of Borneo, scientists found the then oldest representational artwork, thought to  be more than 40,000 years old, of an unknown animal. Prof Adam Brumm from Griffith University said that the latest Indonesian cave art discoveries cast new light on the important role of storytelling in the history of art. “It is noteworthy that the oldest cave art we have found in Sulawesi thus far consists of recognisable scenes: that is, paintings that depict humans and animals interacting in such a way that we can infer the artist intended to communicate a narrative of some kind – a story,” he said.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0vewjq4dxwo,"Pallab Ghosh,",2024-07-03 14:39:21,Unknown
21,Australian Senator resigns after Gaza vote backlash,"Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood. Labor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already “indefinitely suspended” from the party’s caucus after vowing to do it again. “This is a matter I cannot compromise on,” the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was “deeply torn” over the decision. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting. Ms Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator. The 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia’s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician. “Unlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,” she said during a press conference on her resignation. The conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage. Officially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be “as part of a peace process”. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Ms Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received “immense support” from some colleagues, and “pressure… to toe the party line” from others. She also reported receiving ""death threats and emails that were quite confronting"" from members of the public.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus – where MPs discuss the government’s agenda - if she was willing to participate “as a team player”. But in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been “exiled” by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c978ygrg54yo,"Hannah Ritchie,",2024-07-04 06:39:21,Unknown
25,'Almost whole island homeless' in Hurricane Beryl's wake,"Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her. Virtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said. “Union Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,” said Ms Coy in a video message. “There are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.” Fisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed.  “Everything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,” he said. A resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level. “It’s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island – easily 90% – has been erased.” The extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice. “I was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure we would make it out at all.” His cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town.  She said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open. “The pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.” “No one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.” An organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien’s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well. Still, he said the community’s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families. “And obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,” he added. Alizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island – from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents. Plus, of course, generators. With power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX. For its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem.  In a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: ""Hurricane Beryl – this dangerous and devastating hurricane – has come and gone and it’s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.” He also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration. On Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope. “I hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they’re able to rebuild the island but I don’t think so”, said Sebastien. “This is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.” Katrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could. “We’re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.” For years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island’s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean.  Heartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl. Beryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h). Thousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. Yet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren’t even worse. “The most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.” “After witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.”",2024-07-04 11:39:21,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724x1rjlpno,"Will Grant,",2024-07-03 11:39:21,Unknown
31,Sutton's Euro 2024 quarter-final predictions,"Only eight teams are left in Euro 2024, but who will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July? BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did pretty well with his predictions for the last 16, with Switzerland's success against Italy and Turkey's win over Austria the only results he got wrong. Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. That is a vast improvement on your record in the group stage and means that, like Sutton, from the 44 games played in Germany, you have been correct about 22 of them. Will there be any more surprises in the quarter-finals? You can make your predictions below, including England against Switzerland, and France - Sutton's pick to win the European Championship - versus Portugal. Stuttgart, 17:00 BST Spain are the best team in the competition.  Germany were jubilant when Niclas Fullkrug scored their stoppage-time equaliser in their final group game against Switzerland, but they will be gutted that it meant they ended up in this side of the draw. They would rather be playing England, I'm sure. Germany are not just the hosts, though. They have got a bit about them as well. Antonio Rudiger has arguably been the best central defender at this tournament. This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 4-1 Georgia They are a well-balanced team but Spain have stood out and, wherever you look, they have got quality and nous. Rodri and Fabian Ruiz have been dominant on the ball in midfield and they have the intelligence of Pedri ahead of them. On the wings, they have Lamine Yamal, who is such an exciting talent, and Nico Williams, who is impossible to stop in one-on-one situations. So Spain are going to be difficult to stop. If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

32,Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal,"Erik ten Hag was appointed Manchester United manager in April 2022 Manchester United have triggered a one-year extension in Erik ten Hag's contract to keep him at the club until 2026.  The Dutchman's previous deal, which he signed when he was appointed in 2022, was due to expire in 2025. Ten Hag, who joined United from Ajax, has won two trophies in two years at Old Trafford. ""I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,"" said the 54-year-old. ""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined."" Ten Hag stressed ""we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead"".  United finished third in the Premier League during Ten Hag's first season at the club as the Dutchman ended the club's six-year wait for silverware with victory against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. But the Dutchman's second season was far more difficult as United finished eighth in the Premier League and were knocked out of the Champions League group stages.  A 2-1 victory against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final proved vital to Ten Hag keeping his job. The club, led by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe following his investment last December, conducted a review of the team's performance across the season following the victory at Wembley. The review saw United speak to potential replacements for Ten Hag but it was eventually decided that the Dutchman deserved to keep his job in order to work under a new, improved structure. Ratcliffe has overhauled the club's board structure since taking a 27.7% in the club. Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth have all joined in senior positions. ""This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently,"" said sporting director Ashworth. ""With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.” United are in talks with Ten Hag to restructure his backroom staff. Former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was PSV Eindhoven manager from 2022-23, is expected to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.

33,EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China’s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Luís Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China’s EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its “New Three” growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.",2024-07-04 11:52:58,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,"João da Silva,",2024-07-04 09:52:58,Unknown

If there is a criticism of them at these Euros, it is that they have not been ruthless enough, but, in terms of performance levels, they have been head and shoulders above everyone else. That makes it very difficult to go against them here, even though Germany have got home advantage and have also been playing well. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Hamburg, 20:00 BST I really don't understand why Portugal manager Roberto Martinez indulges Cristiano Ronaldo the way he does. We know what a great player Ronaldo has been in the past, and he can still influence games, but you have got to draw the line when it is clear he is having a negative impact on the team. Why, for example, is Ronaldo taking free-kick after free-kick when there are much better options? It's selfish from him, and he has a massive ego, but why is Martinez allowing it to happen? The bigger fault lies with him, and he should be strong enough to do what is best for the team. I may end up with a large dollop of egg on my face if Portugal win the tournament and Ronaldo bangs in a couple of 35-yard free-kicks on the way, but I don't see it happening.  In 300 years people will probably still be talking about what a genius Ronaldo was, but he is 39 and I don't know what Martinez is expecting from him. Football has always been a team game and it feels absolutely ridiculous to rely on him like this when you look at how much quality Portugal have right through their side. This video can not be played 'World class save!' - Oblak brilliantly saves Ronaldo penalty I picked France to win Euro 2024 before a ball was kicked and I am not going to change my mind now. They were not exactly exciting against Belgium in the last 16, but there were signs that they are coming to life, and they look so solid defensively. France have scored only three goals in their first four games in Germany - and they were two own goals and a penalty. I am expecting them to click here, though. I am at this game for Radio 5 Live. My other prediction is that Ronaldo will take seven free-kicks - and not one of them will be on target. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Dusseldorf, 17:00 BST Switzerland are another well-balanced team. They have belief in the way they play, and they seem to be getting stronger as the tournament goes on, as we saw when they beat Italy in the last 16. I had hung my hat on Italy, thinking the holders had to get going eventually - a bit like I have been doing with England - but they didn't play well and a big part of that was down to how dominant the Swiss were. There are plenty of similarities with this tie, but I don't think England will be rolled over like Italy. I am not just backing Gareth Southgate's side blindly, because they deserved to beat Slovakia - just about  - and maybe a moment like Jude Bellingham's equaliser can change the mood of their tournament. This video can not be played Bellingham goal: All the angles There are still plenty of areas where England need to get better. I hate their lack of balance on the left-hand side. Luke Shaw has not played a minute in this tournament yet, and that was a risk that manager Southgate has got badly wrong. At the moment, there is not much point dwelling on that. It is all about getting through this game, and England can do it. I still want to see Cole Palmer start on the right because he offers something different creatively and looks so at ease with himself, but it is pretty obvious that won't happen. We will see one change at the back because Marc Guehi is suspended, and Ezri Konsa will probably come in, which is fine, but that will be it. I am not expecting England to do very much different from what we've seen so far. England are a bits-and-pieces team and are not going to suddenly turn into a side like Spain who play some beautiful football, but they have so much talent that they should still have too much for the Swiss. Sutton's prediction: 1-0 Berlin, 20:00 BST What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. This video can not be played Sublime save from Mert Gunok denies Christoph Baumgartner equaliser There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. They always carried a threat on the counter too. The only problem is they all gave so much in that game. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. The 'Oranje Army' have been amazing too, so the atmosphere at the Olympiastadion is going to be incredible. I am still not fully convinced by the Netherlands team. They beat Romania easily enough last time out, but we don't really know how good Romania are. This video can not be played Highlights: Romania 0-3 Netherlands The Netherlands have to be favourites here, though. With players like Nathan Ake and Virgil van Dijk at the back and Cody Gakpo and Xavi Simons going forward, they have quality all over the pitch. Memphis Depay misses so many chances that he reminds me of me when I was playing for Chelsea, but his movement is excellent and he does a lot of good work for the team. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through.

36,Major safety incident linked to Kevin Campbell death,"Serious concerns over the hospital care of former Arsenal and Everton footballer Kevin Campbell have been flagged up by a health trust, an inquest has heard. Mr Campbell, 54, died at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) on 15 June after being admitted a month earlier. Coroner Zak Golombek said Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the hospital, had declared a Level 5 patient safety incident - the most serious category - about aspects of his care. He said the provisional cause of death given for Mr Campbell was multi-organ failure due to a heart infection. No family members were present at Manchester Coroner's Court as Mr Golombek outlined background details during Thursday's inquest opening. He said that Mr Campbell had been admitted to MRI on 15 May. ""He had been reported to have been fit and well until around January 2024, when he had a number of admissions to hospital before this final admission,” he said. Mr Golombek said the health trust declared a Level 5 incident related to a delay in aspects of Mr Campbell's care and diagnosis, and concerns over decision-making processes concerning palliative care. Mr Golombek said the trust was conducting internal investigations and there would be extra evidence including the investigation report, witness statements from clinicians and a statement from Mr Campbell's next of kin. He said: ""I have also received notification from the trust that a medical cause of death can be offered and, therefore, I will consider evidence from the clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care as to the cause of his death. ""The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis."" He said final determinations on the medical cause of death and the care received by Mr Campbell ""will be made as part of the inquest process"". Proceedings have been adjourned for a hearing at a later date. Mr Campbell’s 24-year-old son Tyrese, who plays for Stoke City, tweeted at the time of his father’s death that ""the pain of this is indescribable and as a son you look at your dad as invincible”. ""He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone."" Kevin Campbell scored 148 goals in 542 appearances in a career involving eight clubs. He won four major trophies with Arsenal and also played for Leyton Orient, Leicester, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, Cardiff and West Bromwich Albion.

37,Who could replace Biden as Democratic nominee?,"US President Joe Biden's feeble debate performance last week sent shockwaves across the Democratic party, raising questions about who could replace him on the presidential ticket should he decide to step down.  The move - though unlikely - would create a logistical nightmare, and could set up an ugly inter-party fight among Democrats just months before voters cast their ballots.  But with Democrats expressing panic and confusion over the future of Mr Biden's candidacy, it has led to discussions about whether the president, 81, is the right candidate to face former President Donald Trump in November. Many Democrats noted the importance of defeating Trump when arguing for or against Mr Biden's claim to the party's nomination.  There are a handful of ways the president could be replaced on the ticket, but chances are slim that Mr Biden would vacate his candidacy with just over four months until the election.  But, if he does, here are some the people who might replace him. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is already on the ticket, is an obvious choice to replace Mr Biden.  As vice president, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights after the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v Wade.  Ms Harris has proved to be a loyal ally to the president and fiercely defended his debate performance. After the event, she admitted the president had a ""slow start"" but argued he went on to provide more substantive answers than Trump.  “People can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance,” Harris told CNN Thursday night.  Ms Harris has the strong name recognition that comes from the job of vice  president, but she has struggled with low approval ratings throughout her tenure.  Forty-nine percent of Americans disapprove of Ms Harris, while 39% approve, according to polling averages tracked by FiveThirtyEight.  Ms Harris will also have a prime-time moment that could vault her ahead of the pack of potential presidential contenders when she faces off against Trump's pick for vice president. The BBC's US media partner CBS is scheduled to host a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention in August.   Gretchen Whitmer, the two term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular mid-west Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.  She has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.  She told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.  In 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.  That political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.  California Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the Biden Administration's fiercest surrogates. He frequently appears on cable news networks praising Mr Biden.  But Mr Newsom has political ambitions of his own.  He is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits have said he would be an appealing stand-in for Mr Biden.  Mr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.  It is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.  He ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden Administration's best communicators.  Mr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as Transportation Secretary.  He helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Mr Trump narrowly carried in 2016.  The governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.  He made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.  The quick repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.  JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.  The billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.  After the debate he called Trump a ""liar"" and said he is a ""34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself"".  Like Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.  The list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.   Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.  Maryland Governor Wes Moore has found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker are often mentioned, as they have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested senate race in a swing-state, has also been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.  A Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama. Though the former first lady has repeatedly said she does not have presidential aspirations.

41,"Nearly 30,000 evacuated from California wildfires","Tens of thousands of people in northern California have been ordered to evacuate as wildfires grow across the state amid a heatwave. Around 28,000 people were told to leave their homes after the Thompson Fire broke out this week, according to reports citing the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).  Dangerously hot, dry and windy weather is expected to continue, with the National Weather Service predicting temperatures could reach 118F (47C) in some areas early next week.  The city of Oroville, near where the Thompson Fire started, cancelled its 4 July fireworks celebration, and officials warned residents not to use fireworks to avoid the risk of starting blazes.  “The last thing we need is somebody who’s purchased fireworks from a local fire stand going out and doing something stupid,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. “Don’t be an idiot, cause a fire and create more problems for us.” Mr Honea said the area had seen four fires within the last couple weeks and cautioned that danger was far from over. “This is a bad fire season,"" he added. Fire season started recently in California and usually runs until October. The size and intensity of fires in the state have grown in recent years.  The amount of burned areas in the summer in northern and central California increased five times from 1996 to 2021 compared to the 24 year period before, which scientists attributed to human-caused climate change. This week, the National Weather Service issued excessive heat and red flag warnings - indicating hot, dry and windy weather - across the state. The agency said “dangerous” temperatures posed a major to extreme risk of heat stress or illnesses. According to CalFire, around two dozen fires that have burned more than 10 acres sparked across the state since the last week of June. The largest one, at nearly 14,000 acres, was in Fresno county. No one has died, and 74 structures across the state have been destroyed or damaged. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Butte County to provide resources. The Thompson Fire started in Oroville, about 70 miles north of the state capital Sacramento, on Tuesday. The city is around 20 miles from Paradise, which was devastated by the Camp Fire in 2018 that killed 85 people. Fires hit the region again in the years following.  As of Wednesday, 28,000 people had been ordered to evacuate the Oroville area, local CalFire spokesman Rick Carhart told the San Francisco Chronicle. The fire as of Thursday was around 3,500 acres and only 7% contained. Oroville City Council member Shawn Webber posted a video on Facebook on Wednesday showing hillsides charred and smoking on both sides of a road in the area. He wrote that firefighters “have done an excellent job protecting us from even more destruction”. California's state parks system said agencies responding to the fire “also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville”.",2024-07-04 12:23:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c10lve5zr81o,"Mallory Moench,",2024-07-04 11:55:28,Unknown
39,"'I'm as happy as I've been in my life,' says aid worker Simon Boas as he faces death","In September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life.  Over the following year, he knitted together his reflections on life into a book - A Beginner's Guide to Dying. The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication. In what he expects to be one of his final interviews, Simon spoke to Emma Barnett on the Today Programme, offering his reflections on life and death as he moved into hospice care.  My pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.   I used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come. It's been such a great bonus, actually.   The book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this.  In some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West.  I spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible.  I spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me.  I've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people.  It does us all good to think about it.  That's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things.  My family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years... All our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone.  And those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective. I hope people will think, ""I'm glad I read that - Simon's story"". And just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone.  You don't need to have been a politician or a mover and shaker or an aid worker or anything in life. All of us make a huge difference.  I love this quote from George Eliot's Middlemarch:  ""The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.” All of us make a huge difference in life. I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different.  If you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future.  All our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward.  We all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are. I love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands.  So, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu.  However, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family. I'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it.  But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready.  As Julian of Norwich said: ""All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.""  Simon Boas expects to move into a hospice on Thursday where he will be spending his final days surrounded by his family.  When the Today Programme checked in with him that morning he was, unsurprisingly, in good spirts.

40,Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks,"It's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks. Up until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use. But these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono. In 2021, Mr Kono had ""declared war"" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: ""We have won the war on floppy disks!"" Mr Kano has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would ""get rid of the fax machine"".  Once seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change. For instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.  The announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a ""symbol of an anachronistic administration"".  ""The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,"" read another comment on X.  Others comments were more nostalgic. “I wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,” one user wrote. Created in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.  A three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information. Sony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.  As part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.  But Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.  Many Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.  People are moving away from those stamps at a ""glacial pace"", said local newspaper The Japan Times. And it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",2024-07-04 12:23:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o,"Kelly Ng,",2024-07-04 05:23:28,Unknown
42,Brazil blocks Meta from using social media posts to train AI,"Brazil has blocked Meta from using Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. It comes weeks after the company abandoned similar plans to use UK and European users' posts for the same purpose. On Tuesday, Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) said it would immediately suspend Meta's latest privacy policy, which allows it to train generative AI models such as chatbots based on posts from its users. A Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was ""disappointed by the decision"", adding that their approach complied with local privacy laws. ""This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,"" the company added. Meta has a significant market in Brazil. There are 102 million Facebook users and more than 113 million Instagram users in the country. The ANPD said it had acted over the ""imminent risk of serious and irreparable damage, or difficulty repairing fundamental rights of the affected [account] holders"".  Meta was given five working days from ANPD's decision to show it has amended its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information found in public posts to train generative AI. If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,935). The company's updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU).  Under its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users' information would be used to ""develop and improve"" its AI products.  In Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages. But that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.  On 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a ""step backwards"" for AI in Europe. However Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil. Pedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD's decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta's data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users. Meta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used. Brazil's data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers' posts could be collected and used to train Meta's AI systems, which could be in breach of the country's data protection law. In addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts. The BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts  from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.

46,Diddy faces new sexual assault case,"Embattled rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is facing another sexual assault case after a  woman came forward with fresh accusations against him. The complaint filed in New York by former porn star Adria English is the latest of several lawsuits filed against the star in recent months.  Mr Combs, who is one of rap's most successful moguls, has consistently denied all allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse, including the latest ones. The star is now reportedly also the subject of a federal criminal investigation, though there is no sign any charges are imminent, according to NBC News. Mr Combs's legal woes have mounted after accusations made by ex-girlfriend Cassandra ""Cassie"" Ventura in November. Earlier this year, he apologised after footage came to light that showed him attacking Ms Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016. The new case against in New York alleges that Mr Combs ""forced and coerced (Ms English) to engage in sex work for him"" at parties. It also alleges that the rapper threatened to ruin her career if she did not comply. A total of 33 allegations are made against Mr Combs and his associates in Ms English's 114-page filing, which gives an account of events between 2004 and 2009. “No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone,” his lawyer told US media. The statement went on to say that ""Mr Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court”. Ms English is the latest in a string of women to make claims against Mr Combs in recent months, following a lawsuit launched by Ms Ventura that was settled by Mr Combs in November for an undisclosed sum.  She had accused him of rape and sexual trafficking over a decade. Mr Combs' team clarified that the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. Various allegations of sexual and physical abuse have been made against the rapper since then. His homes in Los Angeles and Miami, Florida, were raided earlier this year as part of a federal investigation into human trafficking. Mr Combs's team has been notified that he is a subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation, according to NBC News, citing two sources familiar with his legal issues. Details of the reported investigation have not been revealed, and neither federal officials or Mr Combs's legal team have commented on the matter specifically.",2024-07-04 14:54:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gl3z3dvyo,"James FitzGerald,",2024-07-04 13:54:49,
47,"Chickens, lost rings and other strange polling day stories","On election day, millions of us will be casting our votes.  Around 150,000 polling station staff will be running 40,000 polling stations across the UK.  Electoral service managers will have woken up at the crack of dawn knowing they won't get anymore sleep until well into Friday after the counting is done. It is a big job and a serious business - but here are a few stories from the lighter side of running elections. We've got used to seeing dogs in polling stations.  Poultry, less so.  Council workers Sara Chane and Lindsey Carroll were at the polling station in Skelmersdale, Lancashire in May 2021 for the local elections when a chicken wandered in. With no accompanying human - and no valid voter ID - Sara and Lindsey began trying to track down the chicken's owner, including enlisting the help of a nearby florists, all while continuing to run the polling station. ""Come in, don't mind the chicken, we told voters,"" says Lindsey.  ""She was very lovely, very friendly,"" adds Sara.  Eventually a family of farmers offered to take the chicken away while its rightful owner was tracked down. But minutes later, a five-year-old boy turned up to looking for his pet, who he said was named Matilda. Lindsey says that began a frantic hunt to reunite the boy with Matilda, amid fears the wayward bird had inadvertently been handed to chicken farmers. ""We were panicking at this point,"" says Lindsey. ""Have we given this chicken to someone who is just going to kill her?"" Eventually Matilda was tracked down and reunited with her rightful owners - but not before a little more trauma for the bird. Matilda, it transpired had been placed in a pen with a number of other chickens who had rounded on her and given her a literal hen-pecking. The relieved owners took their pet chicken home and gave her a bath, while Lindsey and Sara carried on with their democratic duties. A few hours later, Matilda's family returned to the polling station with chocolates and a tray of eggs as a thank you for helping them retrieve their fugitive feathered friend. Chickens aren't the only unexpected polling station visitors.  Peter Stanyon, chief executive of Association of Electoral Administrators, recalled one incident from the south-west of England when a voter was on a hunt. Seeing the polling station, they decided the pursuit of democracy was more urgent and rode their horse straight into the polling station. At other times, polling stations can get quiet. Nevertheless clerks find ways of passing the time.  Peter remembers one worker in Merseyside who got in trouble when, during a lull, he volunteered to be a last-minute stand-in Santa Claus for a children's Christmas party in the room above the polling station. He thought he had got away with it but got a shock when the next person to sit on his knee was a council inspector who had come by the polling station to see how things were getting on.  In Wakefield, one woman accidentally dropped her £40,000 engagement ring into the ballot box, along with her ballot paper.  Once sealed, a ballot box cannot be reopened until the election count.  It meant the unfortunate bride-to-be had to turn up at the count hours later and wait for the box to be opened. ""It was a valuable ring,"" says Peter, but ""not more valuable than democracy."" The rule stating that a ballot box cannot be reopened has unfortunate consequences for polling station workers as well as the affianced.  Until about 15 years ago, ballot boxes were closed shut with sealing wax. Occasionally the heat from the wax could lead to smouldering. Polling station workers couldn't open the box to put out the potential flames so instead had to find a way to get liquid into the box to put out the fire without causing too much damage to the votes. Often, the ballot papers aren't damaged by flames, but the voters themselves.  Tom Lynan has been an electoral services manager in West Lancashire for nine years. He says rude words and anatomical drawings on ballot papers are common. During elections for police and crime commissioners, Tom says voters used to like to add Batman or Commissioner Gordon as their second preferences. He also says his sister-in-law once threatened to write spoilers for Game of Thrones episodes on her ballot paper, knowing that he would likely have to read it overnight. Despite that particular challenge, Tom still enjoys his job. He says there is ""pride in being able to facilitate democracy for the people of the borough"".  He says: ""People have protested and fought over the right to vote, and we are the custodians of the process that is the foundation of this country and its values. ""The day before polling day is like Christmas Eve and we are the elves, but rather than presents being delivered it is an election being delivered.""",2024-07-04 14:54:50,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy008l7d5j4o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-04 02:54:50,
48,How the BBC reports polling day,"The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or election issues while polls are open on the day of the general election, 4 July. The BBC prepares detailed election guidelines which are written and published for each election, and they include guidance about polling day.  On polling day, the BBC does not report on any of the election campaigns from 06:00 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk, or on social media and other channels. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. The lists of candidates, as well as the manifesto guides, remain available online during polling day. Coverage of what is happening on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather.  It tends to focus on giving information that will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself until the polls have closed. That means no opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until the polls have closed. While the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish ""exit polls"" which includes surveys on how people have said they have voted in the election and may also offer a prediction on the election result based on what voters have said.   The BBC, however, is still able to report on events which are not directly related to the elections; and if there are stories about the mechanics of polling day, especially if they might contain important information to help voters, such as an incident at their local polling station, then that too can be reported, but, of course, with impartiality and editorial justification.  From 22:00 BST, after the close of the polls, the election guidelines no longer apply - but the BBC must still report on the election, of course, with the impartiality requirements set out by both Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines.

49,Ghana chef accused of faking Guinness World Records award,"A Ghanaian chef who claimed to have broken the world record for the longest non-stop cooking by an individual has been arrested over a dispute with his sponsor. Ebenezer Smith held a press conference on Tuesday announcing he was the new world-record holder after cooking continuously for 802 hours and 25 minutes. He presented a certificate purportedly from Guinness World Records (GWR) confirmed him as the record holder. But on Wednesday, a GWR spokesperson told BBC Pidgin the claims were ""not true"" and added that it was ""not our certificate"". In another response to a Ghanaian media outlet, GWR also explained they were not aware of his attempt and that they did not receive an application from him. The chef was arrested by the police shortly after announcing his purported award, over a dispute with his sponsor, the Amadia Shopping Centre, Spintex, in the capital Accra, where he held his cooking marathon in March. They accused him of breaching a contractual agreement by not informing them about the new developments regarding the alleged confirmation of the award. Many Ghanaians have expressed shock and disappointment on social media about the case, which was widely covered when Mr Smith claimed to have broken the record. The chef, who is still in police custody and has not been charged yet, has not commented on the accusations. His unsuccessful record attempt earlier this year attracted the support of several local celebrities. Several Ghanaians have attempted to break Guinness World Records in recent times, including media personality and entrepreneur Afua Asantewaa Aduonum, who attempted the longest singing marathon last year. Earlier this year another chef, Failatu Abdul Razak, attempted the longest cooking marathon in the northern city of Tamale. The current record for longest cooking marathon by an individual is held by Ireland's Alan Fisher at 119 hours, 57 minutes 16 seconds from 28 September-3 October last year, GWR said. It had previously been held by Nigerian chef Hilda Bacci, whose record stood at 93 hours 11 minutes. Her win caused a sensation in Nigeria with people trying to get themselves in the record books by doing things like crying or singing non-stop. She was dethroned by Mr Fisher months after being declared the record holder. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

50,England's 'massive opportunity' to shock All Blacks,"Fly-half Marcus Smith will be key to England's hopes of securing a first series win in New Zealand New Zealand v England first Test Date: Saturday, 6 July Kick-off: 08:05 BST Venue: Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin Coverage: Listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds and follow live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app. When England last toured New Zealand 10 years ago, the All Blacks were on top of the rugby world. After winning the World Cup in 2011, Steve Hansen's side were on an extraordinary run that would culminate in back-to-back glory in 2015. A new crop of future All Blacks stars were coming through, while all-time greats like Richie McCaw and Dan Carter were still in their prime. Even without the injured Carter, and despite strong English performances in the first two Tests, the All Blacks eventually secured a 3-0 series win to cement their status as the dominant rugby nation on earth. The landscape is different in 2024. South Africa and France have stolen a march - the Springboks on the pitch and the French off it. The Japanese league has coaxed some great All Blacks into international sabbaticals or international retirements. Covid took its toll. ""It's been a few tough years, there is no doubt about that,"" said New Zealand Rugby Union boss Mark Robinson. The Henry-Hansen-Ian Foster lineage - which ran the All Blacks for 20 years - has been broken up, with the popular former flanker Scott Robertson, 49, now at the helm after guiding the Crusaders to a remarkable seven consecutive Super Rugby titles. ""He has spent a huge amount of time developing his craft,"" said Robinson. ""He's thought really deeply about the role for a long time. It feels this is the time for him."" But despite the excitement around the Robertson era, the New Zealand rugby public - often so bullish - is a little nervous.  The All Blacks haven't played a game since losing the World Cup final last October, while a host of key players including locks Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick, scrum-half Aaron Smith and fly-half Richie Mo'unga are no longer available. With Sam Cane stepping down as captain, second row Scott Barrett will lead the team for the first time, while Damian McKenzie starts at fly-half. ""There is uncertainty about how this team is going to come together,"" explained Liam Napier of the New Zealand Herald. ""I look at this New Zealand squad and there are so many unknowns,"" agreed former England scrum-half Danny Care. ""They don't have the players anymore that you fear. They have players you massively respect, but as a team, do you go there literally with fear? I don’t think New Zealand has that at the moment. ""This is a massive opportunity for England to go down there and shock the New Zealand world."" Perofeta gets All Blacks nod to face England Rugby Union Daily: New Zealand's new era England prop Marler to start against New Zealand Among the local media, England's sharp performances at the back end of the Six Nations and the polished display in the win against Japan in Tokyo have not gone unnoticed. Nor has the continuity in Steve Borthwick's selection or the tweak in playing style since last autumn's World Cup. ""It’s not traditional England - they have evolved,"" said Napier. ""Maybe England have a chance to surprise the All Blacks with their style. ""There is cohesion there and they have named largely the same team. But how is this All Blacks team going to come together? No-one is quite sure."" While Borthwick has had his whole squad in camp for almost four weeks, Robertson has had his together for just 10 days. Leaders like Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett missed the Super Rugby season while playing in Japan.  ""I’m nervous,"" World Player of the Year Savea admitted on Thursday. ""But nerves bring the best out of us. And it's a great challenge for myself to step forward and try and own it."" ""You hope England can maybe catch New Zealand a little bit on the hop,"" said Care. ""There are a lot of things that put the All Blacks in a different space to where they have been in years gone by,"" added former England wing Chris Ashton. Despite all this, England supporters will be cautious in their optimism. The All Blacks still boast some world-class players, whether in the form of the magnificent Savea or the talented Jordie Barrett [the third of the brothers in the matchday squad]. TJ Perenara is back at scrum-half after a two-year absence. Robertson can even afford to leave the great Beauden Barrett out of his starting XV. England’s inexperienced side - the vast majority of whom have never played in New Zealand - will be tested both mentally and physically. It is the All Blacks in New Zealand and it remains - according to Borthwick - the biggest challenge in world rugby. But it nonetheless feels like England have a once-in-a-generation chance of making history, and becoming only the third English side - after 1973 and 2003 - to win a Test in New Zealand. Under Robertson, the All Blacks will only improve going forward. Any cobwebs will be blown away, and quickly.  Next week's second Test is at Eden Park in Auckland, the spiritual home of All Blacks rugby, where their record is incomprehensibly good. For England, Saturday in Dunedin might be a case of now or never.",2024-07-04 14:54:52,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cleyn3nd72lo,Chris Jones,2024-07-04 14:07:52,
52,Body found in search for child missing in croc attack,"Australian police have found human remains while searching for a 12-year-old they believe was the victim of a crocodile attack. The child was last seen on Tuesday, swimming with family near the remote Aboriginal town of Nganmarriyanga - about a seven-hour drive southwest of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT). “This is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search,” said Senior Sgt Erica Gibson, adding that police would provide support to everyone impacted. Earlier Sgt Gibson had told ABC News that a black crocodile had been seen in the immediate area. As many as 40 members of the community helped police officers in their search for the child, which started shortly after the 12-year-old was reported missing.  They scoured the area by foot, by boat and with the use of helicopters, covering challenging terrain with thick vegetation and a narrow, winding waterway. No details were given on whether the crocodile suspected to have attacked the child had been found. Earlier on Wednesday NT Police Minister Brent Potter said wildlife officers had been authorised to ""remove"" the crocodile from the area once it was located and reiterated the government's safety message. ""We live in a place where crocodiles occupy our water places... it's just a reminder to stay out of the water as best we can."" Found all around the northern edges of Australia - from Broome in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland - saltwater crocodiles were hunted to near extinction but numbers have bounced back since the practice was banned in the 1970s. The NT is now home to an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere else in the world. Attacks though are uncommon. There have been at least two other crocodile attacks in the NT in the past year - a nine-year-old boy was injured in January while swimming in Kakadu National Park, and a farmer escaped a beast's jaws by biting it back in October - but there has not been a fatal attack there since 2018.

54,Teacher who had sex with two schoolboys jailed,"A teacher who had sex with two schoolboys and became pregnant by one of them has been jailed. Rebecca Joynes groomed both boys from the age of 15, first exchanging messages on social media, Manchester Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old was previously convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of sexual activity with another child. Joynes cried and shook in the dock as she was sentenced to six-and-a-half years.  The trial heard that Joynes was 28 when she had come out of a nine-year relationship and was ""flattered"" by the attention of teenage schoolboys. Neither teenager - known as Boy A and Boy B throughout the trial - can be identified due to their age.  Joynes gave birth to Boy B's baby in early 2024, with the child being taken away from her within 24 hours. In a victim impact statement, Boy B said ""one of the hardest things"" was not being told anything about the baby. He added: ""I struggled to come to terms with my abuse, I was completely in denial."" During the trial, he said he felt he had ""betrayed someone I love and done wrong by giving evidence"" but had since realised ""the full extent"" of the abuse and ""tactics used"".  He said he was ""coerced, controlled, manipulated, sexually abused, and mentally abused"", adding: ""I will forever be Rebecca‘s victim and forever linked to her through our child.""  At the sentencing hearing, the judge, Kate Cornell, told Joynes: ""You were the adult, the person in control.  ""You should have known better. You failed to enforce the boundaries of proper conduct but deliberately transgressed them."" The trial heard Joynes would ""laugh off"" inappropriate comments instead of shutting down the behaviour. She gave Boy A all but one of the digits of her mobile phone number as a maths problem-solving exercise in which he had to work out the final digit. They then connected on Snapchat and he sent her flirtatious texts, with the pair agreeing to meet in secret. Boy A lied to his mother that he was staying at a friend's house after school but instead Joynes picked him up and took him to the Trafford Centre, where she bought him a £350 Gucci belt. Judge Cornell said CCTV footage of Joynes buying the belt showed that ""your flirtatious body language and eye contact could hardly be a clearer indication of grooming behaviour"". Back at her flat Joynes had sex twice with Boy A. The next day the boy's mother noticed a love-bite on her son's neck, which he dismissed as ""nothing"". The court heard she stormed into school reception as police were called in about the case. Joynes was then bailed on condition she would have no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18. She told the trial she then moved back to her parents in Wirral after having a ""breakdown"" and she was at a low point when Boy B messaged her on Snapchat.   He later told police they regularly had unprotected sex at her Salford Quays flat and that Joynes had told him she could not become pregnant.  Joynes was arrested for breaking bail conditions and spent five months in custody until she was bailed in November last year. Boy B said in his statement there had been a ""massive mental toll"" on him and his family.   He said he had been told by social services that Joynes had refused to let them update him about the baby's due date, gender or health.  ""The thought of not being able to see my child was heartbreaking,” he added. Judge Cornell said Joynes was a ""high achiever"" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions. ""You felt buoyed and boosted by their attention,"" she added.  ""There's no real insight from you, you continue to deny the offences and have been silent on the distressing impact on these boys.""   Det Con Beth Alexander, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ""School should be a place of safety for children. ""It’s clear from some of the public commentary when Joynes was convicted that there is still a lack of understanding when it comes to men and boys being the victims of sexual offences. ""They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they 'should be happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous. ""Women can still be paedophiles; this term is not reserved only for men. Men and boys can still be victims of sexual abuse.” Additional reporting from PA News.

57,"What's happening in UK election, and what comes next?","Voting has ended and Britain’s Labour Party is projected to have won the UK’s general election with a landslide victory. If the projection based on exit polls is correct, Sir Keir Starmer’s centre-left party will return to power with a large majority after 14 years of right-wing government under the Conservatives. And Mr Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who only entered Parliament in 2015, will become the new UK prime minister on Friday after seeing the King at Buckingham Palace. Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, meanwhile, will have led the Conservatives to their worst result in decades. Exit polls are not official results but they have proved increasingly accurate since the mid-1990s. Now comes the process of confirming the official result. It will be a long night of vote counting and there will undoubtedly be plenty of storylines to follow along the way. Here's what you can expect, and what it means. Like we said, the exit poll is not an official result but has in recent elections been a very reliable indicator of who will form the new government.  The UK runs a parliamentary system with 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of these represents an individual constituency - basically an area – somewhere in the country. The exit poll projects Labour to win 410 seats, the Conservatives 131, the centrist Liberal Democrats 61 and Reform UK (a successor to the Brexit Party) on 13. Other parties and independents will take the rest of the seats. This result would give Labour a huge 170-seat majority.  Right now, election officials in each constituency are busy counting votes, and at some point in the evening will declare their results. Whoever gets the most votes wins and becomes the MP for the area. Some local areas pride themselves on being among the first in the country to announce their winners. Houghton and Sunderland South was the first - returning Labour MP Bridget Phillipson - who is expected to become education secretary in the next government. The announcement of results – often held in school halls – are usually televised. All candidates in a constituency – including those running as a joke – are present on stage. So, on that note, watch out for Count Binface, who is challenging Mr Sunak in his northern English constituency. But perhaps of more political significance will be some of the senior Conservatives who will lose their seats.  Steve Baker, a cabinet minister, and Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader, are projected to have a less than 1% chance of keeping theirs. Jeremy Hunt, who serves as chancellor - the UK's equivalent of a finance minister - has a less than 20% chance. Grant Shapps, the defence minister, and Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, could also lose their seats. That all depends. It will come when it's clear which party will hit the magic number of 326 seats. That figure represents a majority in parliament, meaning the party has enough MPs to be able to pass laws without needing the help of any other party. The leader of the party with the most MPs becomes prime minister, after the King officially invites them to form a government. The leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes what’s known as the leader of the opposition. If the incumbent prime minister loses, the changeover is quick, compared with many other countries. So if this exit poll is correct, Mr Sunak will probably be out of 10 Downing Street – the UK equivalent of the White House -  within a day, with Mr Starmer installed soon after. In late May, facing a significant deficit in the polls, Rishi Sunak surprised many in his own party as well as political pundits by deciding to call a snap election, triggering a six-week election campaign. The Conservatives have held power since 2010 and the country has seen five leaders in that time – including a tumultuous period in 2022 when the UK had three prime ministers in a matter of weeks. For its part, Labour hasn’t won a general election since 2005 and its last result in 2019 under left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn was its worst for almost a century. Keir Starmer sought to show voters during the campaign that the party had moved on, while calling for a change in government after a long period of Conservative government. Mr Sunak, meanwhile, tried to sell the record of his party, and repeatedly warned voters against handing Labour a large majority.",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2v0e074jejo,"Graeme Baker,",2024-07-04 22:35:05,
58,Sir John Curtice: Understanding the exit poll numbers,"Labour have likely secured their anticipated landslide victory, though the party may have fallen just short of the majority Tony Blair won in the 1997 general election. They may have achieved this on a smaller share of the vote than former leader Jeremy Corbyn secured in 2017. Both the Conservative share of the vote and their seat tally could be the lowest in the party’s history. Their seat tally might be affected by their vote falling more heavily in seats where they were previously strongest - a pattern that is largely because support for Reform has risen most there. To add to the Conservatives’ travails, the rise in Labour support is stronger in seats where the party started off second to them. Equally, the Lib Dems have performed especially well in seats where they started second to the Conservatives - and particularly in ones the party held until 2015. It is these patterns that, above all, help explain why the Conservative seat tally is expected to be so low. It appears the Conservatives have suffered heavily in places where more than a third of households have a mortgage – a reflection perhaps of the damage caused by former prime minister Liz Truss’s “fiscal event"". It looks as though Reform UK may win more seats than many polls suggested. This is largely because the Conservative vote has fallen far in seats they previously held, but also because Reform have advanced most in seats where more people voted Leave in 2016. This is especially the case in seats being defended by the Conservatives. Reform are also inevitably advancing more strongly in seats that the Conservatives won in 2017 - where the Brexit Party did not stand in 2019. However, how many seats Reform will win is highly uncertain. Our model suggests there are many places where they have a chance - but a relatively low one - of winning. Meanwhile, Labour’s vote is up more in seats where a large part of the population say they are in bad health - a measure of relative deprivation - and in places where more people voted Leave in 2016. The party also seems to be advancing strongly in Scotland but less well in Wales, where they have held power in the Senedd since 2021. While the Lib Dems are doing relatively well in seats where they start second to the Tories, conversely their vote has been squeezed somewhat in places where the Conservatives were facing a challenge from Labour. They also appear to be doing better in places with a relatively high Leave vote, which was one of Ed Davey’s objectives. The Greens are performing particularly well in places where the population is relatively young. Their success in these places may help to explain why Labour’s share of the vote nationally might be less than 40%. The Greens may still only pick up two or three seats, despite recording their highest-ever general election vote share because of its even distribution across the country. In Scotland, it appears the SNP have suffered a more substantial reverse than was anticipated by most polls. Though the decline in the party’s support appears to be lower in places where a high proportion of people identify as Scottish rather than British. The exit poll only has a small number of sampling points in Scotland. If the poll has even slightly overestimated Labour’s advantage over the SNP, the latter’s tally could end up being higher. The forecast for the SNP - and for Scotland in general, where the exit poll is pointing to substantial Labour gains - must thus be treated with a great deal of caution.",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2x0g8nkzmzo,"Sir John Curtice,",2024-07-04 22:10:05,
55,Labour set for general election landslide - exit poll,"Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent As they wait for more results, some Conservatives are turning their fury on Rishi Sunak’s inner circle. Shortly before polls closed, Sunak announced a string of honours for former cabinet ministers such as Theresa May and Chris Grayling. He also gave a peerage to Liam Booth-Smith, his chief of staff, and a knighthood to Oliver Dowden, his deputy prime minister. I’ve just had this through from a senior Conservative source: ""There is widespread disgust at the reward for abject failure in Rishi’s dissolution list. Sir Oliver Dowden pushed for an early election and has been the worst DPM in living memory, demonstrating terrible political judgment.  ""Lord Booth Smith is the architect of the Sunak project and connived to bring down the biggest election winning Tory PM in a generation. Sunak’s pledge to bring integrity back to politics when he entered Downing Street has proven to be a total lie. This an utter disgrace."" That gives you a flavour of the recriminations which are beginning right now. Sir Charles Walker, who stood down as a Conservative MP at the election, responded to that quote in our radio studio just now, saying: ""The idea that people in the Conservative Party are going to be as sanguine and magnanimous as I am, is for the birds.""",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn09xn9je7lt,Unknown,Unknown,
56,Starmer set to be PM as Tories face worst defeat - exit poll,"Labour is set to win a general election landslide with a majority of 170, according to an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky. If the forecast is accurate, Sir Keir Starmer will become prime minister with 410 Labour MPs – just short of Tony Blair's 1997 total. The Conservatives are predicted to slump to 131 MPs, their lowest number ever. The Liberal Democrats are projected to come third with 61 MPs.  The Scottish National Party will see its number of MPs fall to 10, while Reform UK is forecast to get 13 MPs, according to the exit poll.  The Green Party of England and Wales is predicted to double its number of MPs to two and Plaid Cymru is set to get four MPs. Others are forecast to get 19 seats. The exit poll, overseen by Sir John Curtice and a team of statisticians, is based on data from voters at about 130 polling stations in England, Scotland and Wales. The poll does not cover Northern Ireland. At the past five general elections, the exit poll has been accurate to within a range of 1.5 and 7.5 seats. If the exit poll is correct it will be a remarkable turnaround for the Labour Party, which had its worst post-war election result in 2019, when the Conservatives under Boris Johnson won an 80 seat majority. The Conservatives may avoid the wipe-out predicted by some opinion polls but they are still set for the worst result in the party's history, losing 241 MPs - a devastating blow after 14 years in government. It will mean a Labour prime minister in Downing Street for the first time since 2010 and a likely battle for the future direction of the Conservatives if, as seems likely, Rishi Sunak stands down as leader.  The Tory losses are likely to have been inflicted by the resurgent Liberal Democrats and Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which looks set to win more seats than many polls predicted.  We will have to wait until the early hours, when the bulk of results start rolling in, to see if the exit poll is accurate.  Labour's predicted landslide would be just short of the 179 majority won by Tony Blair in 1997 and the party may achieve it on a smaller share of the vote than former leader Jeremy Corbyn won in 2017, according to Sir John Curtice. But it will be seen as a vindication of Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to change his party and move it back to the centre ground of British politics. Labour shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson won the Houghton and Sunderland South constituency, in the first result of the night. She said in her victory speech: ""Tonight the British people have spoken, and if the exit poll this evening is again a guide to results across our country as it so often is, then after 14 years the British people have chosen change. ""They have chosen Labour and they have chosen the leadership of Keir Starmer. Today our country with its proud history has chosen a brighter future."" In a pattern that looks set to be repeated throughout the night, the Reform UK candidate in the north-east England constituency came second ahead of the Conservative by a large margin. The Liberal Democrats are, meanwhile, set to squeeze the Tory vote in the south of England, where a number of Conservative cabinet members, including Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, are looking vulnerable. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""It looks like this will be our best result for a generation."" Rishi Sunak had insisted he could still win right to the end despite failing to make a dent in Labour's commanding opinion poll lead over the six-week campaign.  Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride told BBC Radio 4: ""This is a very difficult moment for the Conservative Party."" He said he was ""very sorry"" that the exit poll is projecting that a number of his colleagues will lose their seats. On keeping his own seat, he says ""we will have to wait and see"". On Wednesday - the day before the election - Mr Stride made headlines when he admitted he thought it was likely there would be a massive Labour majority, effectively conceding defeat. Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""not a good night"" for the SNP, which is predicted to lose 38 seats, adding that she believed the prediction would be ""broadly right"". Rishi Sunak surprised many in his own party by announcing a summer election. But his campaign was hit by a series of gaffes, from the rain-drenched announcement in Downing Street to his decision to leave a D-Day celebration in Normandy early to record a TV interview and confused messaging about a Labour ""super majority"".",2024-07-04 23:10:05,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1xnzlzz99o,"Brian Wheeler,",2024-07-04 21:10:05,
64,Hurricane Beryl leaves Jamaican homes without power,"Hundreds of thousands of homes in Jamaica remain without power in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. The category four storm - one of the most powerful to ever hit the country - swept along the island's southern coast on Wednesday night, bringing more than 12 hours of heavy rain. Officials and residents are assessing the damage after an island-wide curfew was lifted early on Thursday. Beryl, which has now weakened to a category three storm, is headed for Mexico and the Cayman Islands. It left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, killing at least 10 people. St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Venezuela reported three deaths each, while one person died in Jamaica.  The storm destroyed almost every home on two small islands in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union. Here in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported. One resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: ""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared."" ""It's a disaster,"" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth. On Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees. A full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong. Jamaican energy provider JPS said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning. The hurricane has delivered “a most devastating blow” to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western. Posting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency “significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.” King Charles III, who is also monarch in several Caribbean nations, said on Thursday he was ""profoundly saddened to learn of the dreadful destruction"" left by Hurricane Beryl. The UN has unlocked $4m (£3.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Prime Minister Andrew Holness thanked ""first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis"" on his X account. Beryl became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures. The storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.

63,All you need to know about election night,"Settle in, folks - it’s going to be a long night. Our election night watcher’s guide includes key timings and the pivotal seats you should watch out for as we wait to find out who will be the next prime minister. We’ll also be telling you where you can watch, listen and read everything you need to know about the results from across the BBC. So if you’re staying up, we hope you’ve got Friday booked off and you’re stocked up on snacks and coffee. Now make yourself comfortable. This is the first big moment of the night. Voters in more than 130 constituencies are polled across the country on behalf of broadcasters. The results allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won across Britain. The exit poll isn’t always exactly right, but more often than not it gives a good indication of where we’re heading. The result is being projected on the BBC’s London HQ, Broadcasting House. Staying up past then? We’ve got you covered. Online: Follow all the election developments and results on the BBC News website and app, where we’ll be running a live page through the night with analysis from correspondents and experts. TV: The BBC’s Election 2024 programme with Laura Kuenssberg, Clive Myrie and Chris Mason begins on BBC One and BBC News at 21:55 BST. You can also keep up to date by tuning in to the BBC News Channel and the Election 2024 livestream on BBC iPlayer. There will also be dedicated results programmes in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Sunderland used to be famous for getting the first result out but this year it could come from nearby Blyth and Ashington, a new seat. This is traditional Labour territory but includes towns where voters have switched to the Tories in recent years. The important thing to watch out for here will be the size of any swing towards Labour, which will provide the first bit of hard data pointing to how the party has performed nationally. Remember, all result timings are estimates and could change. Radio: Check in with Nick Robinson, Rachel Burden and Henry Zeffman on Radio 4 and 5 Live. The Newscast podcast team are hosting a watch-along with 150 listeners at the BBC's London HQ. A special edition of the podcast will be available on Friday morning. Listen here. Not many results are due in around midnight - can you resist the urge to go to bed during this lull? There could be an early eye-catching result in Swindon South, where Labour hope to unseat former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. That would be ominous for Rishi Sunak - and he’ll also be concerned if the Liberal Democrats make an early breakthrough in Harrogate and Knaresborough. Starting to feel those first flickers of tiredness? Well, it’s about to start picking up. The big result to look out for is Darlington, which the Tories took from Labour in 2019 under Boris Johnson. Similarly, watch out for Wrexham at around 01:30. To put it simply, if Labour isn’t winning this sort of place back, it probably isn’t winning. In Basildon and Billericay, we’ll find out if Conservative Party chairman Richard Holden’s relocation to this usually safe Tory seat has paid dividends for him. Keep your eyes peeled for Rutherglen, which is due to be the first result from Scotland. We’ll start to find out if pro-independence voters have stuck with the SNP, stayed at home or switched to Labour. Online: Remember, you can see all the results online and they will be updated throughout the night. International users can access all BBC News election content on BBC.com. Boris Johnson won a string of seats in traditional Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England in 2019 on a promise to “get Brexit done”.  Watch out for places like Bolsover, West Bromwich and Hartlepool. They'll start to give us a sense of whether the Conservatives have held on to these so-called red wall constituencies or whether Labour has won them back. If you’re reading this shortly after polls close and wondering what time to wake up in order to see the big moments, this would be a good time to set your alarm for. According to BBC polling guru Prof Sir John Curtice, an eventual result could be forecast by broadcasters around this time in the event of a landslide. It wouldn’t be official - it would just mean that based on the results so far, the BBC and others might feel confident enough to ""call it"". Between 02:30 and 03:00, we’re expecting the pace of declarations to really pick up - so if you’ve got to get up for work soon, walk away now while you still can. Watch for Na h-Eileanan an Iar - this island constituency off Scotland’s west coast might have the smallest population of any in the UK, but it will give us an early sign of whether Labour are breaking through north of the border. In Northern Ireland, the performance of the DUP could be the story of the night. Party leader Gavin Robinson is facing a strong challenge from Naomi Long, the leader of the Alliance Party, in Belfast East, while in South Antrim, the Ulster Unionist Party thinks it has a good chance of returning to Westminster by beating the DUP. The DUP is also under pressure from Alliance in Lagan Valley, which is the seat formerly held by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who resigned as DUP leader earlier this year when he was charged with historical sex offences, which he denies. That result is due a bit later. If you’re staying up, get some coffee and strap in - because if alarm bells aren’t already ringing for one of the two main parties, they soon will be. Bellwether seats like Nuneaton and Stevenage are hotly contested places which have switched between Labour and Tory. The party that wins in Dartford has gone on to form a government at every election since 1964. Keep an eye on Scarborough and Whitby too. In short, if Labour are winning these seats, they‘re likely to be on for a comfortable majority - and if they’re not, then the pollsters may want to keep a low profile for a while. Sir Keir Starmer will be watching from Holborn and St Pancras, where his result is due at around the same time as his predecessor’s. Jeremy Corbyn will be learning his fate down the road in Islington North, where he is standing as an independent. Also watch Chingford and Woodford Green, where Labour’s attempt to unseat former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has been complicated by its former candidate Faiza Shaheen running as an independent.  Then there is Rochdale, where we'll find out if ex-Labour MP George Galloway’s recent by-election victory was a temporary protest vote or if he’s there to stay. In Wales, a good night for Plaid Cymru would mean holding on to their seats in west Wales - which, because of boundary changes, would mean beating Rishi Sunak’s chief whip Simon Hart in Caerfyrddin - and taking Ynys Môn from the Tories. They’re due around this time. If you’re still with us by this stage, then in the words of Chris Mason, you clearly ooze stamina. Now it’s going to get hectic. About one fifth of all the results are due to be announced in a 30-minute window from 03:30. Attention will turn to senior Tories in seats where pre-election polls suggested they could lose. Watch for: There may be some high drama in Surrey, where Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is being pushed by the Lib Dems in Godalming and Ash. A sitting chancellor has never lost their seat but if things are going really badly for the Tories, that could change. Elsewhere, we'll get a sense of how the Lib Dems and Greens are doing. Both Wimbledon and South Cambridgeshire are key Lib Dem targets, but the party will need a much bigger swing to win somewhere like Chichester, which is Education Secretary Gillian Keegan’s seat. If they win there, they’re having a very good night. In Bristol Central, Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer has one of the party’s best chances of taking a new seat. The party’s other leader, Adrian Ramsay, will hope to win in Waveney Valley - though we’re not expecting that result until closer to 04:30. Rishi Sunak’s constituency Richmond and Northallerton isn’t due to declare until around this time, by which time his party’s fate may already be sealed. This could well be the first time in the evening we hear him speak. Reform UK has shaken up this election but will it make it into the Commons? At around 04:00, we’ll find out if Nigel Farage has won in Clacton, a race that marks his eighth attempt to become an MP. Two other big Reform targets are due around that time, too - Richard Tice in Boston and Skegness and Lee Anderson in Ashfield. Elsewhere, the picture in Scotland should be pretty clear after the Glasgow results are through. The SNP will feel it has weathered the storm if it limits any losses there - but Labour wins in Glasgow South and Glasgow West could indicate a real shift across the country. Winning back Gordon Brown’s old seat Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy from the SNP would be a big symbolic moment for Labour, and the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn will hope to prevent any revival in Aberdeen South. Noticed that strange glowing light at the window? That’s the sun coming up. If you’re still awake by now, give yourself a big pat on the back. By the time it’s light, we are likely to know who will form the next government, because enough seats should have been declared for a party to pass the 326 seats needed for a majority. In the event of a Labour landslide or a very comfortable win, we could already have reached that point earlier in the night, closer to 04:00. If the Tories have defied the polls or the election is close, it could come later. If you are still up by now, you are either: a) extraordinarily caffeinated or, b) Professor Sir John Curtice. Either way, you have earned your election night stripes. Mercifully, there should be a bit of a breather around this time as the pace of results slow - but there are some big ones still to come. Deciding to run in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East led to Douglas Ross announcing he will quit as leader of the Scottish Conservatives due to internal party anger over his attempt to serve in Westminster and Holyrood at the same time. We’re due to find out if it was worth it. Johnny Mercer is another high-profile Tory figure facing a tough challenge. Labour hope to take his Plymouth Moor View seat at around this point in the morning. At around 05:30, we’re expecting to get Liz Truss’s result in South West Norfolk. People who went to bed after the exit poll will be waking up to a set of results that is more or less complete, with counting only continuing in very close seats or ones that started late for logistical reasons. If things have gone badly for the Tories, we could still see some big names losing their seats at this point - for example, Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker in Wycombe and Jonathan Gullis, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, in Stoke-on-Trent North. Whatever the result, the focus will now start moving to victory speeches, recriminations, resignations and what the new government will look like. Results night might be over, but really, the big stuff is just beginning - so if you’ve been with us all night, for goodness sake, go to bed.

62,Exit poll: What is the forecast in my area?,"The Labour Party is forecast to win a landslide majority in Parliament, according to an exit poll published as voting ended in the 2024 general election. Labour is set to take 410 seats, well ahead of the Conservatives on 131, according to the forecast based on the poll carried out by Ipsos for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. This suggests Labour is on course for a majority of 170 seats, although they may have fallen just short of the majority Tony Blair won in 1997. The Liberal Democrats are currently forecast to win 61 seats, Reform UK 13, the SNP 10, Plaid Cymru is on four and the Green Party two. Other parties, including those in Northern Ireland, are forecast to get 19 seats. Enter your postcode or a constituency name to find what the exit poll forecast is currently suggesting may happen in your area. Bear in mind that this is only an indication of what may happen. Sir John Curtice, who leads the exit poll team, says the number of seats Reform will win is particularly uncertain. He explains: “Our model suggests there are many places where they have some, but a relatively low, chance of winning.” This look-up will be updated as results come in and the forecasts are modified. The exit poll is a way of forecasting what may happen in the general election, after voting ends but before the results are known. The poll focuses on revealing national trends and is mainly used to forecast which party may form the government at Westminster. Forecasting results at a constituency level is harder, especially if there are local factors that make the election distinct in any particular seat. Researchers at 133 polling stations across England, Scotland and Wales ask around 20,000 people to indicate which way they voted. A team of academics led by Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, uses this and other data to estimate the vote share per party in each constituency and then to forecast each party's likelihood of winning in any given seat. All the individual probabilities are added together to arrive at the forecast seat totals for each party. The exit poll is not held in Northern Ireland so the 18 seats there are labelled “Other”. The model is updated throughout the night as results come in, so seat totals and individual constituencies are likely to change. These maps show the exit poll forecast across England, Wales and Scotland. In the locations coloured grey, the contest is very close. Everywhere else is coloured by the party currently considered most likely to win. When an actual result is declared it will overwrite the exit poll data in this map, and in the postcode lookup above.  Again, the forecasts may change over the night. You will need to refresh this page to see those updates. Rural constituencies are larger than those in cities because the population is more spread out. So here is the same data in a cartogram, where each constituency is shown as equal in size. The cartogram is a way of viewing each seat as the same size, while attempting to show roughly where in the UK they are. All the seats are correctly within the right nation and English region, but they may not follow typical geography beyond that. There are some, mostly around London - whose high population density distorts the map most significantly - that are in different places to where you'd expect, no longer neighbouring the seats they lie next to geographically. All declaration times estimated by the BBC are approximate and the actual results may happen earlier or later than stated. As with the main results, all 2019 figures are notional, because of boundary changes. You can read more about that here.  Full details of how the exit poll methodology was developed can be found at Warwick University Department of Statistics website.

59,'Meat assaults' - Russia's brutal plan to take ground,"On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily. They call them ""meat assaults"": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day. Lt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv. “The Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,” he said. “Our guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.” This tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials. Those attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. “Their main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.” The tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers. In Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine’s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly. Russia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars. And there have been complaints from the Russian side about “crippled regiments”, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat. All of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded. Ukraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines. “There are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,” says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. “We are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.” In the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia’s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances. “Unfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,” says Stupak. There is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win. Western officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives. “It seems like a so-called incremental approach,” Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC. “We receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.” The lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow’s assault on Kharkiv. “If we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,” says Mr Merezhko. “That's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.” But a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war. “We are driving towards stalemate,” former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the “bitter pill” of some form of negotiation. During a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of. “We [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, told reporters in Washington.  Ukrainians fear without hard security guarantees - such as Nato membership, rather than vague talk of a bridge to such status - Russia may simply regroup and attack again in the future. Vladimir Putin is counting on wearing down Ukraine on the battlefield and outlasting the West’s resolve to provide support. As well as launching guided aerial bombs against frontline positions and civilians in Kharkiv, Moscow has also targeted energy infrastructure across the country, leading to increasingly frequent power blackouts and concerns over what winter might bring. November’s US election adds another layer of uncertainty, along with a question mark as to whether the European Union could realistically pick up any slack. For Lt Col Anton Bayev on the frontline near Kharkiv, the ability to strike into Russia may have been vital, but he now sees his enemy adapting its tactics - and not just with “meat assaults”. His losses now come from mortars and glide bombs, while his Ukrainian forces remain short of ammunition. “We need everything, and there is always a lack,” he says. “The boys are holding on. We're all hanging on. It's hard, but everyone knows the price and why it's all being done.” Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Kyla Herrmannsen",2024-07-04 23:10:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80xjne8ryxo,"Gordon Corera,",2024-07-03 23:10:06,
60,Israel tells Gaza ceasefire negotiators to resume work,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to send a team of negotiators to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas. US President Joe Biden welcomed the development, which comes a day after Hamas responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan he outlined in late May. The last indirect talks took place in Cairo earlier that month. Details of Hamas's latest response have not been made public, but a Palestinian official told the BBC that the group was no longer demanding a full ceasefire at the outset of the plan presented by Mr Biden. A senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to ""pretty significant adjustments"" to its position. ""We've had a breakthrough on a critical impasse,"" the US official said, although he stressed that ""this does not mean this deal is going to be closed in the period of days"".  President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu held a phone call on Thursday, which focused on the hostages and ceasefire negotiations, the official said.  On Wednesday, Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators from Egypt and Qatar about ideas it had been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.    Up to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting, until it eliminates Hamas. When he announced the plan on 31 May, President Biden said it was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal, and that it involved three phases. The first would include a ""full and complete ceasefire"" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. The second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a ""permanent end to hostilities"". The third phase the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains. After the two leaders' phone call on Thursday, the Israeli government said in a statement: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu updated President Biden on his decision to send a delegation to continue the hostage negotiations and reiterated the principles that Israel is committed to, especially its commitment to end the war only after all of its goals have been achieved."" Mr Netanyahu has declared his objectives to be the return of all remaining hostages, the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensuring Gaza no longer constitutes a threat to Israel.  The White House said Mr Biden ""welcomed the prime minister's decision to authorise his negotiators to engage with US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an effort to close out the deal"". A source in the Israeli negotiating team meanwhile told Reuters news agency that Hamas's response included ""a very significant breakthrough"" and that there was ""a deal with a real chance of implementation"". A senior Palestinian official told the BBC earlier on Thursday that Hamas had given up the demand for a complete ceasefire. Its new conditions, the official said, related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from a strip of land running along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. The source, who was informed of the response Hamas submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere was positive. ""We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,” the source said. The US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire.  On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the “one exception” to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created ""gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to”.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said he is “committed to the Israeli proposal welcomed by President Biden”, although he has not publicly endorsed the outline as it was laid out. The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,010 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.  Hamas and allied armed groups are believed to still be holding 116 hostages who were taken on 7 October. At least 42 are presumed by Israeli authorities to be dead. The others have been released, rescued or their bodies recovered. Four other Israelis have been held hostage since 2014 and 2015, two of whom are presumed dead.

61,Violent attacks shock France ahead of crunch vote,"A growing number of candidates and activists in France have been targeted with violent or verbal attacks in the run-up to Sunday's tense final round of parliamentary elections. Government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot was putting up election posters with her deputy and a party activist in Meudon, south-west of Paris, when they were brutally assaulted by a gang of youths. Other election campaigners have come under attack across France, reflecting the febrile mood in politics with the far-right National Rally (RN) the front-runner in the election. The motive for the attack on Ms Thevenot and her colleagues is not clear, but she returned to Meudon on Thursday with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who condemned ""attacks of intolerable cowardice"". Images filmed from a block of flats showed the youths swarming around the candidate, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist for President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble alliance. Ms Thevenot told Le Parisien website that when she and her colleagues objected to the youths defacing party posters ""they immediately attacked one of my activists, injuring Virginie"". Ms Lanlo suffered an arm injury, while the activist was punched and hit with a scooter, ending up with a broken jaw. The car windscreen was also smashed by the scooter. Three teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested by police and the incident was quickly condemned across the political spectrum.  Mr Attal called on people to ""reject the climate of violence and hatred that's taking hold"", while RN leader Jordan Bardella said one of his ""big commitments as prime minister"" would be to ""combat record insecurity and repeat offending"". Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has announced that 30,000 police will be deployed across France for Sunday's vote in an attempt to prevent ""the ultra-left or ultra-right"" from stirring up trouble.  The BBC spoke to voters in his constituency in northern France on Thursday who said they feared youths would go on the rampage whoever won, to express their anger at the political system. Law and order is one of RN's big priorities, alongside immigration and tax cuts to target the cost-of-living crisis. RN candidates have also come under attack. Marie Dauchy described being ""violently assaulted"" as she campaigned at a market in La Rochette near Grenoble in the south-east.  A conservative candidate allied with RN, Nicolas Conquer, complained that he and a female colleague had been pelted with eggs. And last month another RN candidate was treated in hospital after he was set upon while handing out pamphlets. Having won 33.2% of the vote in the first round of the snap election, called out of the blue by President Macron, Mr Bardella's party is now aiming to win an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.  But his political opponents have agreed to do all they can to block the far right from winning enough seats to form a government. Seventy-six seats were won outright in the first round by candidates who won more than half the local vote in their constituency, including 39 RN candidates and their allies. The other 501 seats will be settled in run-off votes, and 217 third-placed candidates have pulled out of the race to hand a rival a better chance of defeating RN. Of those 217 withdrawals, 130 candidates came from the left-wing New Popular Front and 81 from the Macron alliance. Marine Le Pen has complained bitterly about the operation to secure ""mass withdrawals"", and blamed those who sought to ""stay in power against the will of the people"". However, she said she thought there was still a chance of winning an absolute majority, if the electorate turned out in big numbers. The latest Ifop poll suggests RN will win 210-240 seats, short of the 289 it needs to form a government. That is down on the 240-270 range of seats that it was estimated to win after the first round. Nevertheless there is fear among some of France's minorities of what RN might do if it gets into power. It aims to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing and to abolish the right to automatic French citizenship for children of foreign parents, if those children have spent five years in France from the age of 11 to 18. Dual citizens would also be barred from dozens of sensitive jobs. One Muslim woman in a district that voted 54% for RN last Sunday told the BBC that RN was gaining ground with every election that took place. On the eve of France's quarter-final tie against Portugal in the European Championships in Germany, national football captain Kylian Mbappé called on voters to ""make the right choice"". After Sunday's ""catastrophic"" first-round results, he said ""we can't put the country into the hands of those people"", without specifying who they were.",2024-07-04 23:10:06,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ngxeyxd9go,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-04 20:10:06,
65,Hezbollah fires 200 rockets and drones into Israel,"The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has launched more than 200 rockets and attack drones into northern Israel, in response to the killing of one of its senior commanders. Israel's military said one of its officers was killed in the barrage, which started a number of fires.  The military also said it had targeted Hezbollah “military structures” and other targets in southern Lebanon in response.  Lebanese media reported that one person was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the town of Houla. The latest barrage, which followed one comprising 100 rockets on Wednesday afternoon, was one of the biggest so far in the nine months of cross-border violence which have raised fears of an all-out war. The Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was one of the most senior figures in the group to have been killed in the conflict. The Israeli military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah’s Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a “large number of terror attacks”. It also described him as “the counterpart” of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of another unit whose killing last month prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 200 rockets and missiles into northern Israel in a single day. There have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October. Hezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries. So far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, and 25 people in Israel, mostly soldiers. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to restore security in northern Israel. ""In the tough campaign against Lebanon we have set a principle - whoever harms us is a dead man. We are making that a reality in practice,"" he said on Thursday. The hostilities have also displaced tens of thousands of people from border communities in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. “The response to the assassination of the dear leader Hajj Abu Nimah [Nasser]... started last night and quickly,"" senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned at Nasser’s funeral in Beirut on Thursday. “This series will continue to target new sites that the enemy did not imagine would be hit.” A spokeswoman for the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said the exchanges were now extending deeper into both sides of the border, and called on both Israel and Hezbollah to show restraint. “We're very concerned... because any exchange, any incident, can escalate into something greater if there is a misunderstanding,” Kandice Ardiel told the BBC. There has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions in recent weeks, with the UN and US warning of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a war that could also draw in Iran and other allied groups. Israeli officials have repeatedly warned that they are ready for a war if diplomacy fails. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that the military would soon be ready to “take any action required in Lebanon, or to reach an arrangement from a position of strength”. Hezbollah, which is seen as a significantly superior foe to Hamas, has said it does not want a full-out war with Israel and that it will observe in Lebanon any ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. But it has also warned Israel that it would fight “without rules” if there was a war.",2024-07-04 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw9y7wqn8j5o,"David Gritten,",2024-07-04 19:10:07,
66,US man jailed in Russia for 12 years on drug charges,"A US citizen has been sentenced to 12.5 years at a maximum security penal colony by a Russian court after being convicted on drugs charges.  Robert Woodland, 32, was detained in Moscow in January and accused by prosecutors of seeking to sell a large quantity of methadone. His lawyer told the Reuters news agency that he had partially confessed to the charges. Mr Woodland, who was born in Russia and adopted when he was two, had travelled to the country in 2020 to find his birth mother. His journey was documented by a Russian reality TV programme. He is the latest US citizen to be imprisoned in the country, with some Western officials suggesting the Kremlin is ""hoarding"" Americans to trade for allies and operatives imprisoned abroad.  In a statement released after Mr Woodland's conviction on Thursday, Russian prosecutors said he had been caught while packaging a large quantity of narcotics at an apartment in the Russian capital.  They claimed he had been working with a large-scale criminal group and had transported 50-grams of the drug from a pick-up point outside the city.  His lawyer, Stanislav Kshevitsky, had initially denied the charges, saying officials had presented ""no evidence"" of drug sales before the court.  But he told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Mr Woodland had confessed to some of the allegations against him. It remains unclear which charges he has accepted.  Footage carried by state media in Russia showed Mr Woodland sitting inside a glass cage in court, staring impassively ahead as the verdict against him was read out.  Russian media reported that Mr Woodland decided to remain in the country after meeting his mother in 2020 and worked as an English teacher near Moscow. His tearful reunion with his mother was broadcast on state television at the time.  The Interfax news agency said he holds US and Russian citizenship.  At least a dozen US nationals, including journalists and active duty soldiers, are currently being held in Russian prisons and penal colonies.  Among those is Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained over a year ago on espionage charges which he denies. The US considers him to be ""wrongfully detained"". Western officials have long suspected that Moscow is seeking to detain Western citizens to use as bargaining chips in prisoner swaps. US law prohibits the payment of ransoms to terror groups, but successive administrations have been willing to offer concessions to other states to secure the release of Americans.  This is what happened to Brittney Griner, who was released at the end of 2022 in a prisoner swap with the US in return for the controversial Russian arms dealer Victor Bout. While the US state department said earlier this year that it was aware of Mr Woodland's case, it avoided commenting directly on the allegations.  Instead, it issued a statement saying it “has no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas"". US officials have repeatedly warned US citizens in Russia to leave the country, citing the risk of wrongful arrest and harassment by authorities.

67,Jill Biden: The quiet influence of Biden's closest adviser,"A day after US President Joe Biden struggled through a 90-minute debate that only served to fuel voter concerns about his age and fitness, Jill Biden stood before well-heeled donors at a New York fundraiser and tried to explain what they had all witnessed.  ""'You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened. I didn’t feel that great,'"" the president had confessed, she told them. ""I said, ‘Look, Joe, we are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you’ve been president.’” It offered an early glimpse into the president's mindset and how he rated his debate performance, which was widely panned as a major blow to his campaign. As doubts about Mr Biden's candidacy began to circulate, his closest adviser was unequivocal about whether he would step out of the race. ""When he gets knocked down, Joe gets back up, and that’s what we’re doing today,"" Mrs Biden said. The first lady has stood beside her husband throughout his decades-long career, from his time as a Delaware senator to becoming commander-in-chief, often serving as the decisive voice behind many of Mr Biden's political choices.  While the president often turns to his tight-knit family on big decisions, Mrs Biden is among a handful of top advisers who wield the most influence over the president and could ultimately help him determine whether it is time to step out of the race.  “It’s fair to call her Biden’s closest adviser,” veteran Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkop told the BBC. “Family matters to him significantly and that makes Jill Biden’s role even more important.” The president’s younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who served as his campaign manager during his years in the Senate, as well as his son, Hunter Biden, are also among his most trusted confidantes.  After the fallout from the debate, Mr Biden huddled with his family for a long-planned trip to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, where they discussed the fate of his campaign and urged him to keep fighting, according to the BBC's US partner CBS. Hunter Biden was among the most vocal family members urging his father to remain in the race, CBS reported.  But as Democratic anxiety over the  81-year-old president's physical and mental stamina has spilled into public view in recent days, many inside the party have looked to the first lady for any hint of wavering over his candidacy.  Instead, she has continued to hit the campaign trail, travelling to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan this week for a string of political and official events. ""Because there's a lot of talk out there, let me repeat what my husband has said plainly and clearly: Joe is the Democratic nominee and he is going to beat Donald Trump, just like he did in 2020,"" Mrs Biden told supporters at a campaign event in Traverse City, Michigan, on Wednesday.  Mrs Biden's influence in the West Wing, however, is not unusual.  Nancy Kegan Smith, president of the First Ladies Association for Research and Education, said there are historic parallels between Mrs Biden and former first ladies. ""Most presidents depend on the uncoloured advice of their wives because that’s the person who is normally closest to them,” she said. She pointed to Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of former President Lyndon B Johnson, who advised her husband - ultimately convincing him with a moving letter - to run for the White House in August 1964 after he became president following the assassination of John F Kennedy. Four years later in 1968, she changed her opinion, telling him to not run for re-election. He listened, Ms Kegan Smith said. Many in the Democratic Party are waiting to see if a similar scenario may unfold in the next month, placing a greater spotlight on Mrs Biden. The first lady keeps a busy schedule. She is the first in the East Wing to keep a day job teaching English at a northern Virginia community college. When she is not teaching, she is often on the road campaigning for her husband. “Most modern first ladies have been in the political game for quite a while and have been political sounding boards to their husbands,” Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University professor who studies first ladies, told BBC News. The president proposed five times before Mrs Biden said yes, and the couple married in 1977, five years after Mr Biden lost his first wife and daughter in a car crash that also injured his two sons. When he decided not to run for president in 2016, he told 60 Minutes ""it was the right decision for the family"". He cited his reasoning was in part because of the loss of his son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.  Mrs Biden specifically played a role in her husband's decision not to run for president in 2003, Ms Kegan Smith said, pointing to a scene described in the first lady's 2019 memoir, Where the Light Enters. In the book, she recalled lounging by the pool as Democratic advisers inside encouraged her husband to launch a campaign. Wearing a bikini, she wrote ""no"" on her stomach in magic marker and walked through the meeting. Biden did not enter the race that year.  But the first lady has also come under pressure in recent days, facing criticism after the presidential debate for praising her husband after his poor showing on the debate stage.  “Joe, you did such a great job. You answered every question. You knew all the facts,” she told him on stage at a post-debate rally in Atlanta. A clip of the exchange was widely mocked on social media. Some Republicans have also seized on Democratic worry, laying blame on the first lady for Mr Biden's debate performance. Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican from Wyoming, even accused Mrs Biden of “elder abuse” in a post on X, for “rolling him out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed”. The Drudge Report, a conservative website, ran a headline on its front page immediately after the debate that read: “Cruel Jill clings to power.” “It’s really unfair to put the burden on her. She’s his spouse. She’s not a politician,"" Michael LaRosa, her former press secretary, told The Hill. “It’s not up to her to save the Democratic Party."" Mrs Biden, meanwhile, has stressed that the president's bid for re-election will continue as the stakes in November are high. “Every campaign is important, and every campaign is hard,” the first lady told Vogue for their August cover story. “Each campaign is unique. But this one, the urgency is different. We know what’s at stake. Joe is asking the American people to come together to draw a line in the sand against all this vitriol.” That urgency is something the campaign is hoping she'll be able to convey to voters. In a statement to the BBC, the Biden campaign called Mrs Biden an ""effective messenger"" on the campaign trail.  “As a teacher, mom, and grandmother, she’s uniquely positioned to connect with key constituencies across the country and speak to the president’s vision for America,” the statement said.  Still, her steadfast support combined with White House dismissals of media reports that the president is weighing his exit have yet to tamp down growing uncertainty about the Democratic ticket. The fallout has triggered a backlash of Democrats, donors and some lawmakers publicly calling for the president's withdrawal from the race.  ""Joe has been knocked down and counted out his whole life... When he gets counted out, he works harder. And that's what he's doing, but he needs your help,"" she told Michigan supporters on Wednesday.  ""We don't choose our chapter of history, but we can choose who leads us through it,"" she added.  For Mrs Biden, that choice remains her husband. ",2024-07-04 23:10:07,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4w21kznw1o,"Rachel Looker,",2024-07-04 17:10:07,

69,President’s daughter posts kiss with woman in country where gay sex is banned,"The daughter of Cameroon's president has shared an image in which she is kissing another woman, sparking mixed reactions in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal. The Instagram post shows 26-year-old Brenda Biya embracing Brazillian model Layyons Valença. ""I’m crazy about you & I want the world to know,” Ms Biya wrote, adding a love heart emoji. Her 91-year-old father, Paul Biya, became Cameroon's president in 1982 and is one of Africa's longest-ruling leaders. Those engaging in same-sex acts or relationships in the Central African nation face up to five years in jail.  Ms Biya - a musician based abroad who goes by the name King Nasty - did not explicitly state her sexuality when posting the picture of the kiss. However, some time after the image was published, Ms Biya shared an article from Le Monde, in which the French newspaper reported that she had ""come out"". She also shared other messages from people expressing their support for her. Transgender Cameroonian activist Shakiro was among those who praised Ms Biya, saying her Instagram post could be a ""turning point for the LGBTQ+ community in Cameroon"". Shakiro said Ms Biya “is now positioning herself as a voice for social change in a country where taboos are deeply rooted"".  Shakiro currently resides in Belgium. She sought asylum there after being convicted of “attempted homosexuality” in Cameroon. Although Ms Biya has been praised by some, several social media users in Cameroon responded to her post with homophobic comments.  Some have speculated whether Ms Biya shared the picture in order to generate a buzz, given her reputation for publishing social media posts that spark controversy among Cameroonians. There have also been questions about whether coming out is a privilege that can only be enjoyed by a select few in the country. “I love this for Cameroon’s First Daughter,” LGBT activist Bandy Kiki said in a Facebook post. “However, it highlights a harsh reality: Anti-LGBT laws in Cameroon disproportionately target the poor. Wealth and connections create a shield for some, while others face severe consequences.” Human rights groups have previously criticised Cameroon’s strict laws against members of the LGBT community. In 2022, Human Rights Watch urged Cameroon to “take urgent action to revoke this discriminatory law and to ensure that the human rights of all Cameroonians, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics, are upheld”. Barrister Alice Nkom, a renowned human rights lawyer who defends LGBT people in Cameroon, said Ms Biya was a ""model of courage"" who is “sending an important universal message of love"". Most media outlets in Cameroon have not reported on Ms Biya's recent picture. The media regulatory body has been known to sanction publications and broadcasters for depictions of homosexuality. The government - and President Biya himself - have not officially commented on the story either. The BBC has contacted Ms Biya and is yet to receive a response.

74,How record-breaking Hurricane Beryl is a sign of a warming world,"Hurricane Beryl is wreaking havoc in parts of the Caribbean – and putting the role of climate change under the spotlight. With maximum sustained wind speeds of more than 160mph (257km/h), it became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years. In fact, there has only been one previous recorded case of a category five Atlantic hurricane in July – Hurricane Emily, on 16 July 2005. The causes of individual storms are complex, making it difficult to fully attribute specific cases to climate change. But exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.  Usually, such strong storms only develop later in the season, after the seas have heated up through the summer. Hurricanes generally need the sea surface to be at least 27C in order to have a chance of developing. As the map below shows, waters along Hurricane Beryl’s path have been much warmer than this. All else being equal, warmer seas mean more powerful hurricanes, because the storms can pick up more energy, enabling higher wind speeds. “We know that as we warm the planet, we’re warming our sea surface temperatures as well,” explains Andra Garner, an assistant professor at Rowan University in the US. ""And we know that those warm ocean waters are a critical fuel source for hurricanes."" In the main Atlantic hurricane development region, the ocean heat content – the energy stored throughout the water column - is at levels not usually seen until September. That is when the Atlantic hurricane season is usually at its most active, as the sea surface is typically at its warmest at the end of summer. This is illustrated by the chart below, where a dot represents a major hurricane between 1940 and 2024. As you can see, most major hurricanes happen in late August and September, and earlier ones are very rare. While a category five hurricane is unheard of this early in the season, its strength fits into the broader picture of how these storms are changing in a warming world. The number of hurricanes has not been increasing, but a higher proportion of them are expected to reach the highest categories globally as temperatures rise. “Although it is uncertain to what extent climate change contributed to the early formation of Hurricane Beryl, our climate models suggest that the mean intensity of hurricanes will increase in the future due to enhanced global warming,” explains Hiroyuki Murakami, research scientist at Noaa’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Another factor to consider this year is regional weather patterns. In the eastern Pacific, El Niño conditions have recently come to an end. El Niño inhibits the formation of strong hurricanes in the Atlantic, because of the way it affects winds in the atmosphere. The opposite phase, known as La Niña, favours Atlantic hurricane development. Currently, there are “neutral” conditions – neither El Niño nor La Nina. But La Niña conditions are expected later this year. This likely transition – as well as rising sea temperatures through July and August – has led to concerns that even more powerful hurricanes could form later in the season. “Hurricane Beryl sets a precedent for what we fear is going to be a very, very active, very dangerous hurricane season, which will impact the entire Atlantic basin,” says Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. In May, the US weather agency Noaa warned an “extraordinary” Atlantic hurricane season could be in store, forecasting between four and seven major hurricanes – category three (111mph) or above - between June and November. On average, the Atlantic is hit by three major hurricanes a year.  Meteorologists and climate scientists have also remarked about how quickly Hurricane Beryl strengthened. It took just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression – with maximum sustained wind speeds of 38mph or less - to a major hurricane (meaning above 111mph). “What makes Beryl particularly notable is that it [...] intensified the fastest from a tropical depression to a hurricane [of any Atlantic hurricane in June or early July],” explains Shuyi Chen, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington. Hurricane Beryl is an example of “rapid intensification” - where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly. It can be especially dangerous, because communities have less time to prepare. The frequency and magnitude of these rapid intensification events in the Atlantic appears to have increased in recent decades. “Unprecedented as Beryl is, it actually very much aligns with the kinds of extremes we expect in a warmer climate,” Dr Garner says. “As we’re warming the planet, we’re essentially “stacking the deck” of extreme events against ourselves, making events like Hurricane Beryl not only possible, but more likely.” “It’s up to us to reduce our emissions to change that story.” Graphics by Erwan Rivault",2024-07-04 23:10:10,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r3g572lrno,"Mark Poynting,",2024-07-04 11:10:10,
70,Groenewegen wins Tour stage six in photo finish,"Dylan Groenewegen claimed his sixth stage win on the Tour de France Dutch rider Dylan Groenewegen clinched victory in a thrilling photo finish to win stage six of the Tour de France. The flat 163.5km route from Macon to Dijon was always likely to end in a bunch sprint, following Mark Cavendish's record-breaking victory a day earlier. But the British rider, 39, finished out of contention in Thursday's sprint and was unable to add to Wednesday's 35th stage win on the Tour, which took him clear of Eddy Merckx for the outright record. Team Jayco–AlUla's Groenewegen, 31, made a late surge for the line to beat Jasper Philipsen by little more than a wheel trim. That gave Groenewegen the sixth stage win of his career and his first since 2022, his first year with his Australian team. Alpecin-Deceuninck's Philipsen was later relegated to 107th place for shifting his line and blocking Wout van Aert during the the final 150m. There was no change at the top of the general classification standings so Tadej Pogacar remains the leader, 45 seconds ahead of Remco Evenepoel, with defending champion Jonas Vingegaard five seconds further adrift in third. Dylan Groenewegen (furthest right) lunged for the line to beat Jasper Philipsen (furthest left) Astana Qazaqstan's sporting director Mark Renshaw said after Cavendish's win on Wednesday that coming into this year's Tour, which is expected to be the Manx Missile's last, the team felt that Thursday's stage would be his best opportunity to clinch the record. Having sealed the deal on stage five, it means Cavendish now has the chance to increase his record before finally calling it quits. With just one climb on the stage, it promised to be a relatively straightforward ride through the vineyards of Burgundy, and so it proved for the most part. Cavendish did show some frustration after the first of two stoppages because of mechanical issues, but he managed to safely rejoin the peloton long before it picked up the pace rolling into Dijon. He was well placed before the Uno-X Mobility team hit the front but Astana started to fall back with less than 2km remaining and, as the race entered the 800m dash to the line, Cavendish had drifted out of contention. Mathieu van der Poel led out team-mate Philipsen, who then hit the front before Groenewegen - sporting sunglasses that feature an aerodynamic beak - and stage three winner Biniam Girmay came back at the Belgian. Philipsen looked to have held them off but it needed a photo to split them, which showed that Groenewegen had timed his lunge for the line to perfection to win it by little more than the width of his wheel trim. Philipsen was later penalised for forcing Van Aert to slow down as they raced along the barriers. The race continues on Friday with an individual time trial over 25.3km from Nuits-Saint-Georges to Gevrey-Chambertin. 1. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/Team Jayco-AlUla) 3hrs 31mins 55secs 2.

72,Murray thanks Wimbledon for 'emotional' farewell celebration,"This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Andy Murray thanked Wimbledon organisers for an ""emotional"" farewell ceremony after his final appearance began with a defeat alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. The two-time singles champion is playing at the All England Club for the last time before retiring later this year. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation with elongated applause. ""It feels like a good ending to me. Whether I deserve it or not, I don't know. But they did a really, really good job,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016. The Murray brothers arrived on a packed Centre Court to a standing ovation. Another followed moments after they lost 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 to Australian pair John Peers and Rinky Hijikata. Murray's parents Judy and Will, his wife Kim and two of their daughters watched on as former BBC presenter Sue Barker conducted a poignant ceremony shortly after. Murray thanked his family, his team members over the years and the fans for their continued support. ""It is hard because I want to keep playing, but I can't,"" Murray said on court. ""Physically it's too tough now. I want to play forever. I love the sport."" This video can not be played Andy Murray looks back on his career with Sue Barker Fellow Grand Slam champions Novak Djokovic, Martina Navratilova, John McEnroe and Iga Swiatek applauded from the side of the court, alongside British players Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie. Murray is set to appear again later this week, having signed up to the mixed doubles with fellow British Grand Slam champion Emma Raducanu. ""It was obviously very special to play with Jamie, we've not the chance to do it before,"" Murray, who won the first of his three major titles at the 2012 US Open, said. ""It was a race against time to get out here and physically it wasn't easy but I'm glad we were able to do it one time together."" Wimbledon has been the scene of many of the defining moments of Murray's career and the emotional ties are why he fought so hard to play one final time. Murray's chances of a last hurrah had been thrown into serious doubt. A back issue caused a loss of power and feeling in his right leg during a match at Queen's three weeks ago. The only option was an operation on 22 June to remove a cyst close to his spine, but it left Murray in a race against time to be fit. Ultimately, having left making a decision until the night before his scheduled singles match on Tuesday, he realised with a heavy heart it was not possible to play a five-set match. Going out alongside 38-year-old Jamie in the shorter doubles format was the next best thing. The plan, which was initially put in place around the French Open in late May, did come to fruition. Not since 1995 had a men's doubles first-round match been put on Centre Court. This occasion could not have been scheduled anywhere else. Murray reached his first Wimbledon final in 2012, losing to Roger Federer in an four-set match which left him in tears and changed public perception about him. Redemption came when he won Olympic singles gold on the same court against the same opponent four weeks later. A year on, Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's singles champion by beating world number one Djokovic in a moment of national celebration. Another triumph at the All England Club came in 2016, which he says he enjoyed more. After both victories, Murray walked back through the marbled corridors of Centre Court - like tradition dictates - and was given a guard of honour before stepping on to the balcony to greet the adoring fans below. The same ceremonial walk was made by Murray again on Thursday night. While Murray had not won the trophy again, it was the only farewell - of sorts - fit for a player who has led British tennis with distinction. This video can not be played Murrays walk out on Centre Court to standing ovation Talk of the Super Murray Bros dominated day four of this year's Championships. The famous Wimbledon queue, where fans camp overnight to grab one of the limited first-come first-served tickets for the following day, grew to a line of 11,000 hopefuls by mid-morning. The Murraynators were there, of course. A group of super-fans, who have travelled the world to watch their hero, slept outside in Wimbledon Park and were rewarded with Centre Court tickets. If you weren't there with a tent and sleeping bag, your alarm had to be set for a time when nightclubs usually kick out. Inside the All England Club, fans not fortunate enough to have a court ticket gathered on Henman Hill - sorry, Murray Mound. Hundreds had been in position all day with picnics and blankets. Back on Centre, supporters took a breather after women's top seed Swiatek wrapped up a straight-set win at about 18:30 BST. Then, the change of stage began. Down came the net and singles posts, replaced by the longer doubles version. A half-hour turnaround allowed the atmosphere to bubble with the Murrays' nearest and dearest taking their seats. Andy's wife Kim was flanked by their daughters, with mum Judy alongside them. Dad Will had travelled down from Scotland to watch. This video can not be played Murray gets Centre Court ovation from Wimbledon greats Andy Murray insisted the brothers were not just playing for show, claiming they had a good chance of winning the match and going far in the tournament. The match did not pan out as they hoped.  It was clear from the third game that the younger Murray sibling was struggling with his movement. His 'will to win' - which has become the epitaph of his tennis career - had not diminished, however. The usual teeth-bearing and fist-pumping was on show. As was the chuntering at his team. Unfortunately, his body was not operating how his mind wanted it to. That's been a recurring theme for the past five and a half years. At the 2019 Australian Open, Murray broke down in a news conference as he said he thought he would have to retire later that year because of a hip injury. No singles player had come back to professional tennis after a resurfacing surgery. Metal-hip Murray not only returned. He returned and won an ATP Tour title later that year. More memorable moments at Grand Slams followed. But he could not regain the level which made him one of the best players of his generation. ""The injuries have been tough, quite significant injuries,"" he said.  ""We've worked extremely hard just to be on the court competing, probably not on the level that any of us wanted but we tried."" This video can not be played Sue-prise!

73,Verstappen & Norris 'both happy to race' after clash,"Max Verstappen took victory at last year's British Grand Prix with Lando Norris finishing second and Lewis Hamilton in third place Max Verstappen says he and Lando Norris ""agreed with 99% of everything"" when they discussed their Austrian Grand Prix clash this week. The pair, who collided while fighting for the lead at the Red Bull Ring on Sunday, resume battle at the British Grand Prix this weekend. Verstappen revealed he ""cared about maintaining his relationship"" with Norris because ""we are great friends"". During their talk this week, the world champion said he told the McLaren driver they could trust each other when racing closely. Verstappen added: ""We go at it flat out - that's what we agreed. That's what we like to do and that's what's good for F1 as well."" Briton Norris said: ""It's clear how he races. It's tough, it's on the limit, it's what I love. I thoroughly enjoyed the fight I had with him. ""The more I've thought about it, the more I think it's just racing. It was good racing, very close to the edge at times. We've spoken about it and we are both happy to go racing again."" Their battle ended when they touched while Norris was trying to overtake Verstappen around the outside and both suffered punctures, a collision for which the Dutchman was given a 10-second penalty. Verstappen recovered to finish fifth while the damage caused to Norris' McLaren forced the 24-year-old's retirement. Norris on 'nerve-wracking' battle with Verstappen and confidence in McLaren British teenager Bearman joins Haas for 2025 How to follow British Grand Prix on the BBC Verstappen said: ""The only thing I cared about was maintaining my relationship with Lando because we are great friends and thats' why I said after the race we had to let things cool down because emotions run high. ""We spoke on Monday and we came to the conclusion that we actually really enjoyed our battle. ""We like to race hard. We have done this for many years not only in F1, like online racing where we had a lot of fun together, and these things have to carry on because that's what we like to do and it's great for F1."" Verstappen added he had reassured Norris about his intentions when they are racing. ""I always said to Lando, 'When you go for moves up the inside or outside, you can trust me that I am not there to try and crash you out of the way'. Same the other way around because we spoke about that as well."" Verstappen leads Norris in the drivers' championship by 81 points  Norris had accused Verstappen of changing his line in the braking zone, which is forbidden in F1, and the Dutchman acknowledged indirectly that had been the case. ""Naturally, there is always a human reaction when someone dives down the inside or outside that you have a bit of a reaction to it,"" said Verstappen. ""But I felt everything I did was nothing massively over the top. ""Of course, like how you design a car, you try to go to the edge of the rules, maybe you find some grey areas here and there, and that's the same how you race because otherwise you will never be a top driver or succeed in life anyway."" Norris, who trails Verstappen in the drivers' championship by 81 points, added: ""Max isn't going to want to crash and ruin his own chances. I don't think he's going to change too much, and I don't think I need to change much. ""There are things from both sides we probably wanted to do better. But avoiding an incident from moving under braking is probably the biggest thing. ""The stewards need to be aware that something can easily go wrong. You're defending and that's fine, but at some point that has a limit and it needs to be imposed."" Asked if they could remain friends if their battles continued for a long time, Verstappen said: ""I think so. It also depends on your personalities. Lando is a great guy, a really nice person, who loves F1 and racing and is very passionate about it. ""You also have to realise that he is fighting for his second win, I am fighting for my 62nd, so your emotions are a little bit different. I know that from myself, when I was fighting for my first wins, that’s what I also said, 'Let's let it cool off'."" Another issue to arise from Austria was that Norris earned a five-second penalty for going off track while trying to pass Verstappen, despite immediately giving the place back, because it was conflated with a warning he had previously been given for exceeding track limits. Norris himself and Williams driver Alex Albon both said that decision was ""silly"". Verstappen admitted it was ""a bit of an odd one"". He said Red Bull have an upgrade on their car this weekend, but that he expected the battle to be close on track with McLaren. Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri said he expected Verstappen to be ""really tough to beat"" because of his car's strengths in the sort of high-speed corners that abound at Silverstone.

75,Raducanu and Kartal aim for Wimbledon last 16,"Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal played each other frequently as juniors Former junior rivals Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal will aim to reach the Wimbledon last 16 on Friday when they play their third-round matches. Raducanu is second on Centre Court against Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari. Fellow Briton Kartal, the world number 298, faces second seed Coco Gauff in the final match on Court One. Before Raducanu's tie, there is an attractive match-up between defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz and 29th seed Frances Tiafoe from 13:30 BST. World number one Jannik Sinner closes the programme on Centre against Miomir Kecmanovic.  Wildcard Raducanu, 21, comes into the third round full of confidence after she thoroughly outplayed Elise Mertens on Wednesday, losing just three games in her success. The test against Sakkari is a rematch of their 2021 US Open semi-final which the Briton won 6-1 6-4 on her way to the title. Now ranked 135th as she continues her comeback from multiple surgeries last year, Raducanu reached the Nottingham semi-finals and Eastbourne quarter-finals in the build-up to Wimbledon. ""I have had quite a few matches on grass so I am feeling really good,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It's a match where I can go out and have a swing. ""I have no pressure or expectation to beat someone in the top 10 right now, but of course I believe in myself and I'm confident with the way I am playing."" This video can not be played Best Shots: Kartal's 'dream run' at Wimbledon goes on While Raducanu rocketed to stardom with her stunning win in New York as an 18-year-old qualifier, Kartalc, 22, has taken longer to make a name for herself. The pair regularly played each other at junior level and a clip of a lengthy rally, external from that period has previously gone viral. Kartal's development was checked by injuries before ""a scary few months at the start of the year"" with health issues. She did not expect to be well enough to play at Wimbledon this year and says coming through qualifying was ""the best thing for me"". Kartal told BBC Sport she had ""spent my whole life kind of under the radar a little bit"". On Friday, she steps into the Court One spotlight to play American Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion. ""I think it's what dreams are made of,"" said Kartal. ""I came here as a little kid, when I was six or seven, watching matches. I've got pictures in my house of me and my family on Centre Court, watching Roger Federer and things like that.

81,Gaza hostage posters outside US lawmaker's office vandalised,"Vandals tore down posters of Israeli hostages hung on the wall outside the Capitol Hill office of a Democratic lawmaker on 4 July, his office said on Friday. Congressman Brad Schneider called the vandalism ""a vile act of hate"".  The posters included photos of more than 100 people, eight of them Americans, taken as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.  Capitol police say they are aware of the vandalism incident outside the congressional office and are investigating. Mr Schneider, a pro-Israel Democrat from Illinois, posted a photo on X, formerly Twitter, showing the posters shredded and tossed across the hallway.  ""This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day,"" he wrote.   ""Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.""  The incident comes less than a week after pro-Palestinian protesters held an overnight rally outside Mr  Schneider's Highland Park home in Illinois. The lawmaker said masked demonstrators banged drums, blew horns and screamed antisemitic chants outside his home. Police dispersed the crowd of around 40 protesters after several complaints from neighbours.  ""These actions don't advance peace,"" Mr Schneider said.  ""Instead, they play directly into the hands of Hamas terrorists enabling them to continue to hold hostage not only those they kidnapped from Israel, but all civilians in Gaza as well.""   The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Over 100 were released during a November cease-fire.  At least 38,010 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

82,'Breakthrough' heightens hopes of Gaza ceasefire deal,"The head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, David Barnea, is reported to have travelled alone to Doha to meet Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani as momentum is again building over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. This appears to be very much a preliminary move in what could once again be a complicated series of discussions aimed at finally bridging the gap between the Israeli government and Hamas over what each defines as its bottom line in what any potential deal would comprise. After Mr Barnea left Doha, the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said gaps still remained between the two sides. Israeli officials had already said that expectations need to be lowered. The latest rekindling of hope for a deal came after Hamas delivered its response to the three-phase proposal that President Biden set out several weeks ago.   The key to that formulation was to put off what has long appeared to be the main obstacle in either side accepting a deal - the demand by Hamas that there must be a permanent ceasefire and the counter-demand by Israel that it must have the freedom to resume fighting in Gaza if necessary. Exactly what Hamas has presented has not yet been made public.  But the Israeli response appears far more positive than in other instances in the past seven months when the process has regained momentum.  A source in Israel's negotiating team said that the proposal put forward by Hamas included a ""very significant breakthrough"". There are indications that this could be that Hamas has accepted the key point of the proposal announced by President Biden - that it would allow negotiations to achieve its goal of a permanent end to the war through the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, rather than demanding it as the starting point. Hamas has throughout bridled at its portrayal by the US in particular as the main stumbling block in agreeing a deal.  Should it become clear that it has indeed made this concession, then the ball would be firmly back in the court of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At no time has he personally yielded an inch in his public commitment to the complete eradication of Hamas - and Israel's right to continue fighting in Gaza after any ceasefire.  He has resisted all pressure from inside and outside Israel to modify that stance.  But the pressure has been building on him from all sides, inexorably. The latest push seems to have come from within his own military.  A recent article in the New York Times, citing unnamed current and former security officials, said that Israel's top generals ""want to begin a ceasefire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being"". Mr Netanyahu dismissed this as defeatist.  But he may not be able to resist such pressure forever - nor the ever growing anger on the streets of Israel from those who want the remaining hostages in Gaza to be brought home now. For Hamas, there are also some signs of growing despair over the continuing war by those who suffer from it every day, the civilian population of Gaza.  And internationally, the patience of mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, may be running out.   Regional countries that wholeheartedly support the Palestinian cause have also been reported to be putting increasing pressure on Hamas to accept a deal.  Its leadership may feel that the group's apparent survival, even if severely degraded both politically and militarily, may be victory enough. And for the international community, the need to find some end to the war has grown even more urgent with the spectre of the confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah potentially erupting into all-out war.  A ceasefire in Gaza could potentially ease those tensions. And for the Biden administration - still reeling in the aftermath of last week's debate between the president and Donald Trump - a diplomatic success here would be a much-needed boost. All these elements suggest that the hopes that have once again been raised may this time finally prove more resilient to the negative factors that have seen them dashed before.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cllyz4y6979o,"Sebastian Usher,",2024-07-05 20:10:27,
80,Biden vows to stay in race and beat Trump in defiant speech,"US President Joe Biden vowed to stay the course in his re-election bid and defeat Donald Trump in a defiant speech on Friday, as questions continue to swirl over whether he will drop out of the race. At a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the 81-year-old acknowledged his disastrous performance in last week's CNN debate. ""Ever since then, there’s been a lot of speculation. What’s Joe going to do?” he told the crowd. “Here’s my answer. I am running and going to win again,” Mr Biden said, as supporters in the crucial battleground state cheered his name. It marked his latest commitment to staying in the race as he seeks to defuse a political crisis that has snowballed in recent days. The 17-minute speech, which was more energetic than his widely-panned performance on the debate stage, comes at a critical moment for his campaign, with donors and Democratic allies considering whether to stick with him. The campaign recognises that the next few days could make or break his re-election bid, according to various reports in US media, as Mr Biden seeks to regain ground that he lost to his Republican rival Donald Trump following the debate. After his speech in Madison, a rare sit-down interview will air on ABC News at 20:00 EDT which will also be closely watched by those questioning his commitment and fitness. As he took the stage at the rally, Mr Biden passed one voter who was holding a sign reading ""Pass the torch, Joe"". Another voter who stood outside the venue held a sign that read ""Save your legacy, drop out!"". ""I see all these stories that say I'm too old,"" Mr Biden said at the rally, before triumphing his record in the White House. ""Was I too old to create 15 million jobs?"" he said. ""Was I too old to erase student debt for five million Americans?"" “Do you think I’m too old to beat Donald Trump?"" he asked, as the crowd responded ""no"". Referencing Trump's criminal conviction in New York, and the other charges he is facing in separate cases, he called his rival a ""one-man crime wave"". Pressure on Mr Biden to step aside has only grown following the debate which was marked by several instances where he lost his train of thought, raising concerns about his age and mental fitness. His campaign is planning an aggressive come-back. His wife, Jill Biden, as well as Vice-President Kamala Harris, are planning a campaign blitz to travel to every battleground swing state this month.  Mr Biden, who is due to speak at another rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked the vice-president for her support. She has emerged as the most likely candidate to replace him on the Democratic ticket if he were to step down. On Thursday, Mr Biden acknowledged that he ""screwed up"" in the debate. He has blamed jet lag for his poor performance, saying that his busy travel schedule prevented him from getting sufficient rest before the debate. ""I didn’t listen to my staff... and then I nearly fell asleep on stage,” he said. The Washington Post has reported that Mr Biden's senior team are aware of the pressure coming from within the Democratic Party to make a decision on the future of his candidacy within the next week.  Three Democrats in the House of Representatives in Congress have now called for him to withdraw from the race - Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Raúl Grijalva of Arizona and Seth Boulton of Massachusetts.  “President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington’s footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,” Mr Moulton told radio station WBUR on Thursday. However, no senior Democrats have called on him to quit, as his campaign has pointed out to reporters. On Friday, reports emerged that Senator Mark Warner was attempting to form a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Mr Biden to drop out of the race. The reports, including one in the Washington Post, suggested Mr Warner had deep concerns following the CNN debate. At the rally in Madison, multiple Biden supporters told BBC News that they supported his bid for re-election and were not concerned about the debate debacle. ""I’m not worried about his health. I think he can go all the way to the election and beyond,"" said primary school teacher Susan Shotliff, 56. Some said that while Mr Biden struggled for words, more focus should be on his Republican rival. ""During the debate, [Trump] told a bunch of lies. How is that any worse than what Biden did?"" said Greg Hovel, 67. Others expressed more concern. ""I wanted to have a first hand look at how he’s like, his mannerisms, his energy,"" said Thomas Leffler, a health researcher from Madison. ""I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump."" ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl5y8n5d09qo,"Mike Wendling in Madison, Wisconsin & Max Matza,",2024-07-05 21:10:27,
78,Pope Francis critic excommunicated by the Vatican,"An Italian archbishop and staunch critic of Pope Francis has been excommunicated by the Vatican, its doctrinal office has said.  Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of schism - meaning he has split from the Catholic Church - after years of fierce disagreement with the pontiff.  The 83-year-old ultra-conservative has previously called on the Pope to resign, accusing him of heresy and criticising his stances on immigration, climate change and same-sex couples. Archbishop Vigano was a senior figure in the Church, serving as papal envoy to Washington from 2011 to 2016.  In 2018 he went into hiding after alleging that the Pope had known about sexual abuse by an American cardinal and failed to act. The Vatican rejected the accusation. Over time, the archbishop became associated with US conspiracy theorists, criticising Covid vaccines and alleging a ""globalist"" and ""anti-Christian"" project by the UN and other groups - both familiar conspiratorial themes. On Friday the Vatican's doctrinal office said his refusal to submit to Pope Francis was clear from his public statements. ""The Most Reverend Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of the reserved delict [violation of the law] of schism,"" the statement said, adding that he had been excommunicated - or banished  from the church. Responding by a post on X, the archbishop linked to the decree that was emailed to him and said: ""What was attributed to me as guilt for my conviction is now put on record, confirming the Catholic Faith that I fully profess."" Archbishop Vigano was charged with schism and denying the pope's legitimacy last month.  At the time, he write on X that he regarded the accusations against him as ""an honour"".  ""I repudiate, reject, and condemn the scandals, errors, and heresies of Jorge Mario Bergoglio,"" he said, using Argentine Pope's given name. Pope Francis has put himself at odds with traditionalist Catholics by making overtures towards the LGBTQ+ community, championing migrant rights and condemning the excesses of capitalism.  Last year, he took action against another ultra-conservative critic, dismissing Bishop Joseph E Strickland of Texas when he refused to resign after an investigation.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84j07d0j92o,"Ian Aikman,",2024-07-05 17:10:27,

Mr Orban is the EU's only head of government to have kept close ties to the Kremlin following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. After the meeting, which lasted several hours, Hungary's PM said Russia and Ukraine were still ""far apart"" in their views on achieving peace.  ""Many steps are needed to end the war, but we took the first step to restore dialogue,"" he said.  The Russian leader called it a ""frank and useful"" conversation. He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy. Volodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Earlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting ""not just as a long-time partner"" but as a European Union representative.  However, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU.  ""The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU,"" Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X.  ""The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine."" ""Appeasement will not stop Putin,"" European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. Ukraine also condemned the visit: ""For our country, the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all states to strictly adhere to it,"" the foreign ministry said a statement.  Earlier this week, Mr Orban visited Kyiv, saying ""a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations"". President Zelensky - who has had frosty relations with Mr Orban - did not publicly respond to the proposal.  Ahead of Ukraine’s offensive last summer, Mr Orban warned that Ukraine cannot win on the battlefield.  Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Hungarian prime minister has underlined that Russia’s advantage in resources and men makes Putin’s country unbeatable.  However, many Ukrainians believe any ceasefire would simply cement Russia’s hold over territory it has seized from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot. Mr Orban has been a vocal critic of Western support for Ukraine. He previously slowed agreement on a €50bn ($54bn; £42bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia. Tuesday's visit to Kyiv was his first in 12 years, while he met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time. During Mr Orban's joint appearance with Mr Zelensky, the body language between them was not warm, and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements. But for the next six months Mr Orban's position as head of the Council of the European Union means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe.  His visit to Kyiv came on his second day in that role, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml29r8d2zxo,"Jaroslav Lukiv and Nick Thorpe,",2024-07-05 16:10:27,
76,Keir Starmer: From indie kid to prime minister,"Three years ago Sir Keir Starmer seriously considered quitting as Labour leader. It was 2021 and his party had just lost the Hartlepool by-election to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.  It was the first time Labour had ever lost the seat. Three short years feel like a political lifetime ago now.  Sir Keir has become only the fifth person in British history to take Labour from opposition to power.  His party has gone from a historic thumping at the general election in 2019 – to victory in 2024. The Hartlepool result though, is a reminder that Sir Keir’s journey to Downing Street was far from straightforward. In fact, for a long time his life and career were on a very different path. Keir Starmer, one of four children, was brought up in the town of Oxted on the Kent-Surrey border. He was raised by his toolmaker father and nurse mother, who suffered from a debilitating form of arthritis known as Still’s disease. Sir Keir has spoken about the challenges of growing up at a time of high inflation in the 1970s. “If you’re working class, you’re scared of debt,” he said during the election campaign.  “My mum and dad were scared of debt, so they would choose the bill that they wouldn’t pay.” The choice was the phone bill. Sir Keir had a lot going on in his younger years.  He was obsessed with football (on the centre-left of midfield, of course). He was a talented musician and learnt violin with Norman Cook, who went on to become chart-topping DJ Fatboy Slim. Sir Keir also had a rebellious streak. He and his friends were once caught by police illegally selling ice-cream on a French beach to raise cash. But what about politics? There were always clues, including his name which was given to him as a tribute to the first leader of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie.  Sir Keir dabbled in left-wing politics over the course of his pre-parliamentary life.  That started at school, when he joined the Young Socialists, Labour’s youth movement. After school, Sir Keir became the first person in his family to go to university, studying law at Leeds University and later at Oxford.  At Leeds, he was influenced by the indie music of the 1980s, from The Smiths and The Wedding Present to Orange Juice and Aztec Camera. His biographer, Tom Baldwin, notes his favourite drink as a student was a mix of beer and cider - or Snakebite - and he had a taste for curry and chips. For a while after graduating, Sir Keir lived above a brothel in north London. More importantly, he was building a reputation as a workaholic that would see him go on to become a successful and prominent human rights lawyer. At the same time, Sir Keir continued his left-wing activism, as a prominent contributor to the magazine Socialist Lawyer.  But politics was a side interest and, for much of the next 20 years, his legal career was his focus. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions, the chief prosecutor for England and Wales. Sir Keir likes to talk about this period in life as an example of his dedication to public service, and often recalls his role in prosecuting terrorist gangs. But what else? Under the 2010-15 coalition government, he had to implement significant cuts, with the Crown Prosecution Service’s budget reduced by more than a quarter. He also oversaw high-profile decisions including the prosecution of MPs over their parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal and prosecuting the then Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne for asking his wife to take speeding points for him. Sir Keir's legal work was rewarded with a knighthood in 2014. But how successful was his leadership?  Towards the end of his tenure, Sir Keir admitted in a BBC interview that vulnerable victims were still being let down by the justice system. It wasn't until the age of 52 that the career change came.  Sir Keir was selected for a safe Labour seat in north London, winning comfortably. He and his predecessor Rishi Sunak became MPs on the same day. But it wasn’t a happy time for the Labour Party.  The Conservatives had just won the general election and a bitter factional battle loomed after Jeremy Corbyn became leader. Much has been said and written about Sir Keir’s journey from backbencher to the Labour leadership – and now to Downing Street. But some things are worth highlighting. When he became leader, Jeremy Corbyn made Sir Keir shadow immigration minister but it didn’t last long.  He resigned after less than a year, one of dozens of frontbenchers who quit after the Brexit referendum in an attempt to force Mr Corbyn out. When that failed, and Mr Corbyn saw off a leadership challenge, Sir Keir returned to the fold as shadow Brexit secretary. Sir Keir’s position on Mr Corbyn has evolved over time.  In 2019, he was asked on BBC Breakfast to repeat the sentence “Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister”. He did.  A few months later, he would tell the BBC he was “100%” behind Mr Corbyn and working with him to win a general election.  While others refused to serve under Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir stayed in the tent and helped persuade the leader to back a second Brexit referendum at the 2019 election. That election was a disaster for Labour. Mr Corbyn quit and Sir Keir won the race to replace him.  But when he took over, a lot of people thought Boris Johnson was destined to govern for some time.  Many saw Sir Keir as a leader who could help rebuild – but few thought he was the man who would take them back to power. When did that change? The polls give us a good indication.  Sir Keir’s Labour trailed Mr Johnson’s Conservatives in the polls for much of 2020 and 2021 when the Hartlepool by-election was held.  But that started to change after the first reports of Downing Street parties during the pandemic, when strict restrictions were in place around social gatherings. There is a clear point in the polls where Labour overtakes the Conservatives in November 2021.  Its lead increased significantly after the Liz Truss mini budget and has been consistent and significant ever since. Sir Keir’s allies argue that wouldn’t have happened without big changes in the Labour Party. Sir Keir has sometimes been ruthless.  Jeremy Corbyn was thrown out of the parliamentary party and ultimately barred from standing as a Labour candidate.  Economic policy was tightened; meaning policies were junked if they weren’t seen as affordable.  Sir Keir embraced British patriotism, using the union jack as a backdrop for speeches and getting his conference to sing God Save the King. All of that has contributed to Sir Keir’s message of change. He spent the campaign arguing he had changed Labour and could change the country too. The election result will also mean change for the Starmer family.  Sir Keir, now 61, married his wife Victoria in 2007. Her intention is to keep working for the NHS in occupational health as he serves as prime minister.  Lady Starmer has been seen at some high-profile events like conference speeches, a rally last week – and at a Taylor Swift gig. But she is unlikely to play as prominent a role in public life as some partners have in the past. Sir Keir though has been candid about the impact high office could have, particularly on his teenage son and daughter.  He told the BBC in 2021: “I am worried about my children. That is probably the single thing that does keep me awake – as to how we will protect them through this.” It’s a challenge the Starmers will now face as they move into Downing Street at the end of a testing, far from straightforward, journey.",2024-07-05 23:10:27,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw4y9evzzppo,"Nick Eardley,",2024-07-05 12:10:27,

90,Jailed Russian dissident moved to prison hospital,"Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was jailed after criticising President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine, has been taken to a prison hospital, his wife says. Evgenia Kara-Murza said on X that officials refused to comment on his condition when his lawyers tried to visit him. Last year Mr Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-British citizen, was jailed and transferred to a prison colony in Siberia. His wife says he suffers from a neurological condition as a result of poisonings. Mr Kara-Murza, 42, has accused Russian authorities of trying to poison him in 2015 and 2017. On Friday, lawyers for the dissident arrived at the Omsk prison colony but were not told where he was for five hours and then not permitted to visit him in hospital, Evgenia Kara-Murza says.  The outspoken critic of the Kremlin was arrested in April 2022. In 2023 he was sentenced to 25 years for spreading ""false"" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an ""undesirable organisation"". He has criticised President Vladimir Putin over the Russian government's crackdown on dissent and the war in Ukraine. He had also played a key role in persuading Western governments to sanction Russian officials for human rights abuses and corruption. The US state department has described Mr Kara-Murza as ""yet another target of the Russian government's escalating campaign of repression"". Mr Kara-Murza, who comes from a Soviet dissident family, received British citizenship when he moved to the UK as a teenager with his mother. His wife has expressed concern over his wellbeing while in prison, particularly following the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny earlier this year.

88,Andrew Tate free to leave Romania but not the EU,"Controversial influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan are free to leave Romania but not the EU, a Bucharest court has ruled.  They had previously been banned from leaving the country where they are awaiting trial, indicted on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. They deny all allegations against them.  The decision to allow freedom of movement in the EU is not final and can be appealed. The brothers said the move represented a ""significant victory and major step forward"" in their ongoing case.  The brothers' lawyer, Eugene Vidineac, called the ruling a ""reflection of the exemplary behaviour and assistance of my clients.  ""Andrew and Tristan are still determined to clear their name and reputation; however, they are grateful to the courts for placing this trust in them."" Posting on X, a platform from which he was previously banned, Andrew Tate said: ""The sham case is falling apart."" The Tate brothers, former kickboxers who are dual UK-US nationals, are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the brothers in an indictment published in June last year, and seven alleged victims were identified. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence against him and there is a conspiracy to silence him. The internet personalities are also wanted in the UK over sexual offences allegedly committed there. The brothers have had restrictions on their movement for the past two years.  They were held in police custody during the criminal investigation from late December 2022 until April 2023, before being placed under house arrest until August, when courts put them under judicial control.

89,Sunak's 'dismal end' and 'bland' Starmer: World media reacts to UK election,"By BBC Monitoring and Matthew Davis The Conservatives have emerged with ""broken bones"" from the UK election after Rishi Sunak's ""dismal end"" - but the big question for some in the international media is whether the ""bland, even boring"" Keir Starmer can clean up the UK's ""mess"". Labour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time.  For Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean ""the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders"", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile. Voters ""were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,"" the paper says, adding that ""Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party"". German business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result ""opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit"". ""Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,"" the paper said. Mr Farage’s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an “election earthquake”, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives. French media largely hails Labour’s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader’s success in Clacton, ""the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader"". According to Le Monde, the UK’s return to the centre-left is ""striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections"". Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: ""The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced."" Conservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer “a reassuring institutional alternative”. But for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as “a bit bland, even boring”. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, “previous leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results”. In Hungary, the press there noted two issues: “Unchanged support for Ukraine”, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for “a more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,” said the left-wing paper Telex.  The New York Times casts Labour's victory as ""a seismic moment in the UK’s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s"". But it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots. ""The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters’ faith in mainstream politics,"" the Times says. For ABC News, Rishi Sunak’s campaign to remain Britain’s prime minister showed a lack of political touch. ""Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters."" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May — ""with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,"" the broadcaster said. Meanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: ""The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos."" ""Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,"" the paper said. By Rupsha Mukherjee  Most TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat.  “British Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,” The Times of India noted. The Wire website called it ""a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government"". Everything Sunak tried during the campaign “really failed”, Times Now TV added. “Everyone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat."" But the Labour win “is also a triumph for India”, one news site thought, suggesting that Sir Keir Starmer would seek better relations with Delhi. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring China team China’s only official statement so far has been via its foreign ministry, which said China “had noticed the results of the British election” and “we hope to get Sino-UK relations along the right track”. Despite these hopes, state media outlets were not overly optimistic.  “With six prime ministers in eight years, can Starmer clean up the UK’s mess?” asked broadcaster CCTV. Given the next government faces “the most challenging issues in 70 years”,  “public dissatisfaction” might soon follow, mused The Paper.  The Global Times, however, published a positive profile of the prime minister-to-be, saying Sir Keir was “not the inflammatory politician that people imagine”, and that media impressions of him are that he is “conscientious, good at management, and a little dull”.  China can hope for a more pragmatic relationship with the UK, the paper said. By Anastasia Bazenkova and Yuriy Martynenko Russia’s state-controlled TV channels have presented the UK election result as a “miserable failure” and a ""crushing defeat"" for the Conservative party and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. State channel Rossiya 1 said that Brexit was the only achievement of 14 years of Conservative rule and Channel One objected to how Russia had been cast in the election in the UK, which has helped rally Western opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.  “This election, like politics in general in Britain in recent years, just can’t manage without an enemy figure in the form of Russia,"" the channel said. Outlets and commentators in both Russia and Ukraine don't expect the election to change UK policies toward Russia. “For Moscow [Keir Starmer's] arrival in power changes nothing, since he takes anti-Russian positions and supports continued backing for Ukraine,” said NTV, another leading Russian channel. Pro-government paper Izvestiya thought anyway that: “Political changes in Europe show that for the electorate, internal issues are becoming much more important than Ukraine.” In Ukraine, the country’s national wartime news service Suspilne thought the same. ""For the first time in 14 years, power will change hands in the UK, but this will not have an impact on support for Ukraine,"" the news service said.

86,What's happened in UK election and what comes next?,"Sir Keir Starmer is the UK's new prime minister, after his Labour Party swept to power in a landslide general election victory. The Conservative Party suffered a dramatic collapse after a tumultuous 14 years in power, which saw five different prime ministers run the country. It lost 250 seats over the course of a devastating night.  Rishi Sunak - the outgoing PM - accepted responsibility for the result and apologised to defeated colleagues during a brief statement outside a rainy 10 Downing Street. He said he would resign as party leader in the coming weeks. In his first speech as prime minister after greeting dozens of jubilant Labour supporters who had lined Downing Street, Sir Keir vowed to run a ""government of service"" and to kick start a period of ""national renewal"".  ""For too long we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity,"" he said. ""I want to say very clearly to those people. Not this time.""  ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while, but have no doubt the work of change will begin immediately.""  The result marks a stunning reversal from the 2019 election when Labour, led by the veteran left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, suffered its worst electoral defeat in almost a century.  On the other side, Robert Buckland, a former Conservative minister who lost his seat, described it as ""electoral Armageddon"" for the Tories. It is the party's worst result in almost 200 years, with an ideological battle over its future direction expected ahead.  It's been a long night of results. Here's what it all means. Britain's House of Commons has 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of their ""seats"" represents a constituency, or district. So far Labour has won 412 seats, while the Conservatives have slumped to just 121 and centrist Liberal Democrats have taken 71. Reform UK, a successor to the Brexit Party, is set to pick up four seats, as is the left-wing Green Party.  There is just one seat left to be declared, in Scotland, for the constituency of Skye and Ross-shire.  Labour's surge was partly aided by the collapse of the Scottish National Party (SNP). The party has been hit by a succession of controversies around its finances and fell to just nine seats overnight. The expected 170-seat majority in the House of Commons for Labour is an enormous number but still short of the majority of 179 won by the party under Tony Blair in the 1997 election.  But for more perspective, the Conservatives' win in the 2019 election under Boris Johnson - seen as a very strong performance - saw them get a majority of 80 seats.  A reminder: If a party holds a majority, it means it doesn't need to rely on other parties to pass laws. The bigger the majority, the easier it is. There were, however, a number of notable defeats for Labour to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza tickets - especially in areas with large Muslim populations.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance to the conflict. In February, the party called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but critics said it was too slow to reach that position.  Centre-left parties in other Western countries were keeping a keen eye on the trend ahead of the poll, amid fear of a growing backlash from their own voters over their support for Israel.  As constituencies have declared their results live on television - with all candidates lined up next to each other on stage - there were some major moments. Perhaps the most notable was the defeat of Liz Truss. The former prime minister served just 49 days in Number 10 before being ousted by her party. She narrowly lost to Labour in the constituency of South West Norfolk, having previously held a huge 24,180 majority. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative business secretary and arch-Brexiteer, was another of the biggest names to suffer defeat. He lost his East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour.  He told the BBC that he couldn't ""blame anybody other than myself"" for the loss but he took a ""small silver lining"" from the fact that the Conservatives would be ""at least the official opposition"" - a reference to fears they wouldn't even have that. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, looked rattled after losing his seat in southern England.  Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, who ran against Rishi Sunak for the party leadership before he became prime minister, lost her seat in Portsmouth. As the night wore on, a succession of other Conservative cabinet ministers also lost their seats, including Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer.  But Jeremy Hunt, who served as chancellor - the UK equivalent of a finance minister - held on to his seat but with a much-reduced majority. Mr Sunak also won his seat in Yorkshire with a comfortable majority of about 12,000 -  but used his acceptance speech to concede and confirm his party had lost the election.  Labour lost two big names of their own. Jonathan Ashworth and Thangam Debbonaire were both expected to be a part of Keir Starmer's incoming cabinet.  Things move pretty fast in British politics - there is very little time between an election result and the installation of the new prime minister.  By mid-morning moving vans had arrived to help Rishi Sunak out of 10 Downing Street. He was then whisked away to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.  Then, just 14 hours after the initial exit poll dropped, Sir Keir was formally invited by the monarch to form the next government. Moments later - watched by the world's media - he walked up Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time as prime minster.  He has already started appointing a new cabinet.  Angela Rayner has been made deputy prime minister, while Rachel Reeves has become the first female chancellor.  Meanwhile David Lammy is the new foreign secretary with Yvette Cooper as home secretary. Speaking before he handed his resignation to the King, Mr Sunak wished the new PM well.  ""His successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent public spirited man who I respect.""    He's fairly new to politics, relatively speaking. Sir Keir started his professional life as a barrister in the 1990s, and was appointed the director of public prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, in 2008. He was first elected in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency in north London in 2015, and took over leadership of Labour after the party's poor 2019 general election, pledging to start a ""new era"" after the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir was re-elected in the same constituency on Thursday, saying in his victory speech people were ""ready for change"" and promising an ""end the politics of performance"". ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community, your future,"" he said. ""You have voted. It's now time for us to deliver."" The Labour leader largely avoided making big pledges during the campaign. But during his address outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said his government would strive to ""rebuild"" British public services such as the NHS, slash energy bills and secure the country's border.  ""You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change,"" he vowed.  You can read Sir Keir's full profile here. This election's insurgent party was Reform UK, the right-wing successor to the Brexit Party and the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage, its leader, finally won a seat on his eighth attempt - but his party's initial projection of 13 seats fizzled to four. That's still better than UKIP and the Brexit Party ever did, and Mr Farage has been celebrating. The party's share of the vote looks to be about 14%. Reform drew controversy during the campaign over offensive statements made by some of its candidates and activists.  Mr Farage will be joined in the House of Commons by former Conservative party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, Reform founder Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe. From their new perch in parliament, the party could seek to cause trouble for the Conservatives and pick off more voters from the party's remaining base.

85,Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?,"Three decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of ""fulfilment centres"", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. ""For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',"" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. ""It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,"" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by ""living in a cave"". So the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over ""severe"" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: ""What the heck is left?"" ""Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?"" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to ""keep taking swings"" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a ""whole graveyard of bad ideas"" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention ""in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century"", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. ""Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,"" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziukėnas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. ""It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,"" he says. Amanda Mull points to another priority for Amazon in the years ahead: staving off competition from Chinese rivals like Temu and Shein. Amazon, she says, has ""created the spending habits"" of western consumers by acting as a trusted intermediary between them and Chinese manufacturers, and bolting on to that easy returns and lightening fast delivery. But remove that last element of the deal and you can bring prices down, as the Chinese retailers have done. ""They have said 'well, if you wait a week or 10 days for something that you're just buying on a lark, we can give it to you for almost nothing,'"" says Ms Mull - a proposition that is appealing to many people, especially during a cost of living crisis. Juozas Kaziukėnas is not so sure - suggesting the new retailers will remain ""niche"", and it will take something much more fundamental to challenge Amazon's position. ""For as long as going shopping involves going to a search bar - Amazon has nailed that,"" he says. Thirty years ago a fledging company spotted emerging trends around internet use and realised how it could upend first retail, then much else besides. Mr Kaziukėnas says for that to happen again will take a similar leap of imagination, perhaps around AI. ""The only threat to Amazon is something that doesn't look like Amazon,"" he says.",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5l6vnvqjo,"Tom Singleton,",2024-07-05 12:10:28,

83,US cities can now punish homelessness. Will it help or hurt a crisis?,"""I still have 20 more minutes before I have to move,"" Anthony yelled from his green tent on a Hollywood sidewalk as he heard footsteps approaching. Officials in Los Angeles had come by earlier to warn him that he could face arrest if he didn't move his belongings. They told him about the recent Supreme Court opinion that opened the door for cities and states across the US to punish anyone sleeping outdoors — the most significant ruling on homelessness since at least the 1980s, when many experts say the modern US homeless crisis began. It's added to the lengthy list of worries Anthony says he already has. ""I’m just trying to survive,” he told the BBC while lying down in his tent, using a blue backpack as a pillow. A black trash bag sits inside, filled with what belongings he can carry as he moves from one area to the next. “Some nights I don’t get no sleep,” he said. “I’ve been tired all day. I just want to lay somewhere comfortable and get a good nap in. And that’s it. I am not bothering nobody.” Moments later, Anthony packed up his tent and went looking for a new place to call home. The high court’s ruling is already having a ripple effect on cities across the country, which have been emboldened to take harsher measures to clear out homeless camps that have grown in the aftermath of the pandemic. Many US cities have been wrestling with how to combat the growing crisis. The issue has been at the heart of recent election cycles on the West Coast, where officials have poured record amounts of money into creating shelters and building affordable housing. Leaders face mounting pressure as long-term solutions - from housing and shelters to voluntary treatment services and eviction help - take time. “It’s not easy and it will take a time to put into place solutions that work, so there’s a little bit of political theatre going on here,"" Scout Katovich, an attorney who focuses on these issues for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told the BBC. ""Politicians want to be able to say they’re doing something,” The problem, Ms Katovich and other advocates say, is arresting or fining the homeless will only worsen the problem. “This tactic simply kicks the can down the road. Sure, you might clean up a street but the people you arrest will surely be back.” The high court's ruling last week didn’t mandate how cities and governments should handle homelessness - but it gave communities leeway to take more severe measures without the fear of legal recourse.  The case began in the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, with a population of around 40,000. Over the last 20 years the city doubled in size, but its supply of affordable and public housing did not keep up. Housing prices skyrocketed and the number of homeless grew.  Elected leaders passed laws allowing the city to issue $295 (£230) fines - or 20-day jail sentences for repeat offenses - to unhoused people sleeping or camping in public. Three homeless people sued the city in 2018 after they received multiple citations they were unable to pay.  An appeals court found such laws virtually banned homelessness and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.  The Supreme Court finally ruled that cities were clear to prohibit homeless people sleeping outside in public places.  “A handful of federal judges cannot begin to ‘match’ the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding ‘how best to handle’ a pressing social question like homelessness,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority's opinion.  Theane Evangelis argued this case before the Supreme Court on behalf of Grants Pass.  She says city officials had their hands tied because they could not force anyone into a shelter. She argues those who refuse to use the services offered end up staying in encampments.  “Living in tents is not a compassionate solution, and it's not treating people with dignity. And so the Supreme Court's decision was remarkable in the degree to which it listened to those cities,” she said. Leaders in Grants Pass say they plan to examine the Supreme Court opinion before making a plan on whether to enforce its ban on encampments.  The ruling comes at a critical time for the unhoused.  Last year, the US tracked the highest numbers of homeless people since 2007 - when the US Department of Housing and Urban Development started tracking such data. There were 653,104 homeless people counted as part of the agency's yearly homeless assessment in 2023. That's a nearly 11% increase from the year prior. The ACLU has been tracking the reaction to the decision by city leaders across the US.  It has  already sent a letter to Manchester, New Hampshire, after the mayor promised to ban encampments to “make our streets safe, clear and passable”. Other city leaders, like the mayor in Lancaster, California, have promised to “be much more aggressive” against encampments in neighbourhoods and near stores. Mayor R Rex Parris told the Los Angeles Times “we’re going to be moving them really fast”. State lawmakers in Oregon also seem poised to look at changing laws that will give them greater latitude to rid homeless camps, local media reported. In Spokane, Washington, leaders are asking authorities to dismantle more camps. But fining people who don’t have the means for housing worsens their finances, advocates say.  Arresting them can make it harder to find a job or housing, experts told the BBC. “There is mounds and volumes of evidence showing that having an unpaid citation and a warrant out for arrest, let alone in incarceration, prevents people from accessing housing, jobs in other places,"" Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California in Los Angeles told the BBC.  ""It actually prevents people from accessing shelter.”  Not all cities have welcomed the court decision.  In Los Angeles, the mayor called the  ruling “disappointing” and vowed to continue investing in affordable housing, voluntary treatment and eviction protections. Days after the opinion, the city released a homeless count showing the first drop in nearly six years. Advocates say it is a prime example that other cities can learn from. “Real change takes time,” Sasha Morozov, a regional director for PATH, a leading homeless provider in the Los Angeles area, told the BBC. Ms Morozov noted, though, outreach teams in the greater Los Angeles area are still working to inform those living on the streets about the Supreme Court’s ruling. Teams are also preparing for increased demand for legal services. Around the corner from Anthony, Topher Williams, 28, calls a makeshift tent on a sidewalk home.  Black and blue tarps are tied to tree branches and street parking poles. Plywood boards line the edges of the structure, which he calls a three-room apartment. Mr Williams, who told the BBC he was an Army veteran, has been living on the streets for four years. An unlucky combination of medical expenses and the pandemic's economic struggles left him without a job or shelter. Like Anthony, he’s frustrated at the lack of compassion from city officials and law enforcement. “It's mind blowing the way people look at us. The way people straight up treat us like we're like less than animals. And they have no idea,” he said, tears welling in his eyes. “I served eight years in the military. I did two tours of duty. I gave the ultimate sacrifice fighting for this country, and to be treated like I’m a second-class citizen is wild.” Asked if he was scared about potential arrests, he said it's part of this way of life.  “We’ve got a lot that we have to deal with already. A lot of the things are kind of stressful. But I don’t worry about things until they start affecting me.” Like Topher, Anthony said being arrested may not be the worst outcome. “At least I’ll have a bed and maybe I’ll be in the system and get the right kind of help.”",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y8jj64y5o,"Sam Granville and Christal Hayes,",2024-07-05 01:10:28,
87,What went wrong for the Conservatives?,"The Conservative Party had become accustomed to almost being the Manchester City of politics. A blue, winning machine for so long that some of its key players could barely remember anything else. But their streak - that delivered Tory prime ministers in four elections in a row - has been brought to a dramatic end. Many Tories, both winners and losers, are almost speechless and still processing it. One told me they were simply ""not coherent"". A post-mortem on what went wrong with their tactics and leadership, and where to go next, is now beginning. When I speak to Conservatives, several themes come up repeatedly. Some feel Labour's policy offering was not drastically different to theirs, but think the choice became more about perceptions of ""competence"".  They have had five leaders, and prime ministers, in less than 10 years. Seismic events, from Brexit to Covid to multiple leadership contests, splintered the party into ideological factions. Some Tories spent more energy plotting to take each other down than their opposition - and never really patched things up. Scandals rocked the party in a whack-a-mole fashion, from lockdown parties to sexual misconduct allegations to a mini-budget that contributed to raising interest rates. An election betting saga was the cherry on top. When I asked former Chief Whip Sir Mark Spencer during the campaign if the party had a conduct problem, he mentioned that other parties also had to suspend MPs for poor behaviour - which is true - but conceded this had become too regular. Then there was the undoubted desire for change - a word Labour deployed in its campaign. The cost of living, NHS waiting lists, and small boats were all issues voters raised on the doorstep - and felt had been getting worse, not better. Nigel Farage's late return to the fray meant the latter theme became a particular thorn in Tory sides, with some right-leaning voters who switched to Reform UK wanting tougher immigration policies and lower taxes. Rhetoric and policies attempting to win them back alienated some more centrist Tories who abandoned the party for Labour or the Liberal Democrats, leaving the Tories pincered in between. This was a more comfortable switch for some centrists who didn’t feel they could vote Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. Did these circumstances mean defeat was inevitable? Most Tories I've spoken to describe the result as ""not unexpected"", but some feel the scale of it could have been mitigated. There were avoidable gaffes - like Rishi Sunak leaving D-day commemorations early. While Boris Johnson was prone to gaffes too, some of his fans felt Mr Sunak didn’t charm voters back in the same way. The former prime minister still yielded chants of ‘Boris! Boris!’ at an eleventh-hour rally to try to energise the campaign. There is still a lingering bafflement among some about why Mr Sunak decided to call the election in July. Their campaign guru, Isaac Levido, had argued for a later date - hoping by then there would be more ""measurables"" to demonstrate their policies were having an impact. A flight of asylum seekers taking off to Rwanda, for example, or an interest rate cut. But he lost that argument. And the Conservatives had little evidence in their armoury of some of their policies working when they went to the electorate. The risk of the alternative, Mr Levido's critics argued, was that more bad news could come down the road for the Tories - more Channel crossings this summer, more offenders being released because of prison overcrowding, universities going under. But policy and identity wise, what else could the Conservatives have done? That's where their focus will lie now as a search for the soul of the party begins. Mr Sunak has confirmed he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to choose his successor. There have been murmurings for the last few weeks about whether an interim leader is appointed to avoid the awkwardness of, for example, the former PM having to do Prime Minister's Questions from the opposition benches.  Could this be someone who served in the cabinet previously - like Sir Oliver Dowden, James Cleverly, or even Jeremy Hunt, who just about scraped back into the Commons?  If so, it would probably need to be someone who doesn't actually want to run for leader full time. Otherwise, Mr Sunak could stay on until the next Tory leadership contest concludes. There are some MPs who have been working behind the scenes for a long time on shoring up their support, including Kemi Badenoch (the bookies' favourite) who is on the right of the party, and Tom Tugendhat, who is more to the centre.  Former contenders like Suella Braverman and former Sunak ally-turned-critic Robert Jenrick are tipped to run too. They both spent time in the Home Office, are on the right of the party, and have criticised the government's record on immigration. One interesting thing to note, though, is who the remaining Tory MPs are, and what that might mean for who wins support among the parliamentary party. I've had a quick skim over the new intake of Tory MPs and who they backed in the first Tory leadership contest of July-September 2022. Interestingly, the majority are Sunak-backers, with a hefty chunk of Liz Truss supporters too. Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have lost a couple of their key allies on the right of the parliamentary party. A couple of Mr Tugendhat’s backers are gone too. Why do the leanings of the remaining MPs matter? Well, partly because this will determine how the Tory party decides to shape itself going forward. Does it decide to elect someone on the right of the party, like Ms Badenoch, Mrs Braverman or Mr Jenrick, to try to stave off the growing influence of Reform UK who have now won several seats? Some in the party argue not being tougher on issues like immigration was part of their downfall. Or does it try to shift back toward the centre ground with a candidate like Mr Tugendhat or Mr Hunt to reclaim some of the space Labour is now trying to occupy on the political spectrum?  Some in the party argue the Tories' drift to the right was part of the problem, and alienated socially liberal, but fiscally conservative, voters. The answer will be the result of a lot of tussling and soul-searching over the weeks to come.",2024-07-05 23:10:28,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng05k1z0eo,"Ione Wells,",2024-07-05 16:10:28,
93,Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?,"US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing. Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the “flying piano” because of its poor gliding characteristics.  Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead. Aerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft’s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls “a combination of gliding and surfing”. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350’s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn. Mr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years’ experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon’s drone delivery project, on the basis that “there has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft"".  The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by. Mr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project.  “We’ve engaged outside advisors to be devil’s advocates,"" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery.  On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. “It stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.” However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. “It should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.” Regulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft. Mr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. “The FAA has always been super risk averse. That’s their business!” Fred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he’s put  “my entire adult life” into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business. Mr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board. Cutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%. But gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment. The initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human “safety pilot”. This should make certification from the FAA easier. “Aerolane is not trying to change everything at one go” he says. Their ultimate goal is autonomous operation using AI, or as Mr Lopez puts it “to pull the pilot out of the seat"". And, if the flying piano can surf, then who knows what's possible?",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kk4lxe702o,"Michael Dempsey,",2024-07-04 23:10:29,

95,Israel settlements drive heightens Palestinian land angst,"Palestinian officials have condemned a dramatic new settlement drive by Israel in the occupied West Bank which includes retroactively authorising three outposts. The move is set to further stoke tensions in the territory which has seen a surge in violence since the war in Gaza began on 7 October. Palestinians claim the West Bank as part of their hoped-for future state.  Settlements are widely seen as illegal under international law although Israel disagrees. The three unauthorised outposts that have now been legalised under Israeli law were described as new neighbourhoods of existing settlements.  They are in sensitive areas in the Jordan Valley and near the southern city of Hebron. In addition, the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said on Thursday that Israeli authorities had approved or advanced plans for 5,295 homes in dozens of settlements. It also emerged this week that the Israeli government’s Higher Planning Council had approved the largest seizure of West Bank land in over three decades. Some 12,700 dunams (5 sq miles) has been seized in the Jordan Valley and declared as Israeli state land. This year has marked a peak in the extent of declarations of state land with a total of 23,700 dunams affected. The Palestinian president’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdeinah, said the new announcements confirmed that Israel’s “extremist government is bound by the right-wing policy of war and settlement”.  He said the latest steps would not “achieve security and peace for anyone” and were meant to prevent the establishment of a geographically contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. Last week, Israel’s security cabinet decided to authorise retroactively five settlement outposts built without official government approval. The UN, the UK and other countries denounced the move as undermining hopes for the two-state solution - the internationally approved formula for peace that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. “Israel must halt its illegal settlement expansion and hold to account those responsible for extremist settler violence,” the British Foreign Office said. “The UK’s priority is to bring the Gaza conflict to a sustainable end as quickly as possible and ensure a lasting peace in the Middle East, through an irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution.” The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the overall strategy for the West Bank. However, the far-right Israeli minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, has welcomed the recent steps. ""We are building the good land and thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state,"" he said Wednesday on social media platform X. Not counting annexed east Jerusalem, about half a million settlers live in the West Bank alongside three million Palestinians. Last year, Mr Smotrich instructed government departments to prepare to double the number of settlers to one million. Since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, successive Israeli administrations have allowed settlements to grow.  However, expansion has risen sharply since Mr Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a hardline, pro-settler governing coalition. Last month, Peace Now released the recording of an address by Mr Smotrich to his Religious Zionism party, in which he proposes transferring the management of settlements from military to civilian officials, building a separate road bypass system for settlers,  expanding farming outposts and cracking down on unauthorised Palestinian construction. Peace Now warned that the plan would irreversibly change the way the West Bank was governed and lead to “de facto annexation”.",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq61w10qwpo,"Yolande Knell,",2024-07-05 17:10:29,
96,Victoria Starmer: Who is the new UK PM's wife?,"Throughout the general election campaign and much of her husband's tenure as Labour leader, Victoria Starmer has kept a low profile. Apart from appearances at Labour conferences, the odd state banquet and a Taylor Swift concert, Lady Starmer, nee Victoria Alexander, has sought to avoid public appearances  Asked on LBC about his wife's low profile, Sir Keir pointed out that she had a full-time job at an NHS hospital and that their eldest child was doing his GCSEs. “We took the decision that whilst I was out and about on the road, we wanted to create the environment where he could study calmly in ordinary circumstances.” However, now that Sir Keir has won the election and become prime minister, Lady Starmer may find it trickier to shun the spotlight.  When she first met Sir Keir in the early 2000s, he wasn't a politician but a barrister. She was a solicitor working on the same case.  Sir Keir told ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories, of their first meeting: ""I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate. ""I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said 'let's get her on the line.'"" He grilled her forensically on the paper but as he hung up he heard one comment from her. ""She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,"" Sir Keir said. ""And quite right too."" Despite the rocky beginnings, the relationship blossomed after a first date in the Lord Stanley pub in Camden, north London.  Speaking to his biographer Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir described her as ""grounded, sassy, funny, streetwise - and utterly gorgeous too"".  He proposed just a few months later on a holiday in Greece. ""Won't we need a ring, Keir?"" was her down-to-earth response.  They were married in 2007 at the Fennes estate in Essex, walking down the aisle to one of Sir Keir's favourite pieces of music - Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.5, 2nd movement. He later described her to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs as an ""incredibly warm, wonderful woman. My complete rock"". The couple have two teenage children - but have been at pains to keep them out of the limelight - making a point of not naming them in public.  Lady Starmer grew up in north London, not far from where she currently lives with her family.  She attended Channing School before studying law and sociology at Cardiff University. While there, she got involved in student politics, becoming president of the student union in 1994.  In an interview with the student newspaper Gair Rhydd, she said her main priority was to campaign against cuts to student grants.  Rob Watkins was at Cardiff University at the same time and worked as a photographer for the paper. He remembers the future Lady Starmer as being ""witty and professional, clearly dedicated to her work"" and aware of her responsibility to the people she represented.   Lady Starmer currently works in occupational health for the NHS - something her husband has frequently referred to during his time as Labour leader.  He says it gives him insight into the problems faced by the health service.  Speaking to the Times in May, Sir Keir said his wife intended to keep her job if he won the election.  “She’s absolutely going to carry on working, she wants to and she loves it."" While the couple say they want to keep life as normal as possible for their children, their domestic life has already been disrupted by Sir Keir's job. In April, pro-Palestinian demonstrators held a protest outside their home, hanging a banner outside their house and laying children's shoes outside the front door.  Lady Starmer had returned from a shopping trip with her son when she saw the protesters.  Asked how the protest made her feel, Lady Starmer said: ""I felt a bit sick, to be perfectly honest.""",2024-07-05 23:10:29,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe2veedg40o,"Kate Whannel,",2024-07-05 11:10:29,

In his first speech as prime minister after greeting dozens of jubilant Labour supporters who had lined Downing Street, Sir Keir vowed to run a ""government of service"" and to kick start a period of ""national renewal"".  ""For too long we've turned a blind eye as millions slid into greater insecurity,"" he said. ""I want to say very clearly to those people. Not this time.""  ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while, but have no doubt the work of change will begin immediately.""  The result marks a stunning reversal from the 2019 election when Labour, led by the veteran left-wing politician Jeremy Corbyn, suffered its worst electoral defeat in almost a century.  On the other side, Robert Buckland, a former Conservative minister who lost his seat, described it as ""electoral Armageddon"" for the Tories. It is the party's worst result in almost 200 years, with an ideological battle over its future direction expected ahead.  It's been a long night of results. Here's what it all means. Britain's House of Commons has 650 MPs, or members of parliament. Each of their ""seats"" represents a constituency, or district. So far Labour has won 412 seats, while the Conservatives have slumped to just 121 and centrist Liberal Democrats have taken 71. Reform UK, a successor to the Brexit Party, is set to pick up four seats, as is the left-wing Green Party.  There is just one seat left to be declared, in Scotland, for the constituency of Skye and Ross-shire.  Labour's surge was partly aided by the collapse of the Scottish National Party (SNP). The party has been hit by a succession of controversies around its finances and fell to just nine seats overnight. The expected 170-seat majority in the House of Commons for Labour is an enormous number but still short of the majority of 179 won by the party under Tony Blair in the 1997 election.  But for more perspective, the Conservatives' win in the 2019 election under Boris Johnson - seen as a very strong performance - saw them get a majority of 80 seats.  A reminder: If a party holds a majority, it means it doesn't need to rely on other parties to pass laws. The bigger the majority, the easier it is. There were, however, a number of notable defeats for Labour to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza tickets - especially in areas with large Muslim populations.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance to the conflict. In February, the party called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but critics said it was too slow to reach that position.  Centre-left parties in other Western countries were keeping a keen eye on the trend ahead of the poll, amid fear of a growing backlash from their own voters over their support for Israel.  As constituencies have declared their results live on television - with all candidates lined up next to each other on stage - there were some major moments. Perhaps the most notable was the defeat of Liz Truss. The former prime minister served just 49 days in Number 10 before being ousted by her party. She narrowly lost to Labour in the constituency of South West Norfolk, having previously held a huge 24,180 majority. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Conservative business secretary and arch-Brexiteer, was another of the biggest names to suffer defeat. He lost his East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour.  He told the BBC that he couldn't ""blame anybody other than myself"" for the loss but he took a ""small silver lining"" from the fact that the Conservatives would be ""at least the official opposition"" - a reference to fears they wouldn't even have that. Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, looked rattled after losing his seat in southern England.  Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt, who ran against Rishi Sunak for the party leadership before he became prime minister, lost her seat in Portsmouth. As the night wore on, a succession of other Conservative cabinet ministers also lost their seats, including Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer.  But Jeremy Hunt, who served as chancellor - the UK equivalent of a finance minister - held on to his seat but with a much-reduced majority. Mr Sunak also won his seat in Yorkshire with a comfortable majority of about 12,000 -  but used his acceptance speech to concede and confirm his party had lost the election.  Labour lost two big names of their own. Jonathan Ashworth and Thangam Debbonaire were both expected to be a part of Keir Starmer's incoming cabinet.  Things move pretty fast in British politics - there is very little time between an election result and the installation of the new prime minister.  By mid-morning moving vans had arrived to help Rishi Sunak out of 10 Downing Street. He was then whisked away to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation to King Charles III.  Then, just 14 hours after the initial exit poll dropped, Sir Keir was formally invited by the monarch to form the next government. Moments later - watched by the world's media - he walked up Downing Street and addressed the nation for the first time as prime minster.  He has already started appointing a new cabinet.  Angela Rayner has been made deputy prime minister, while Rachel Reeves has become the first female chancellor.  Meanwhile David Lammy is the new foreign secretary with Yvette Cooper as home secretary. Speaking before he handed his resignation to the King, Mr Sunak wished the new PM well.  ""His successes will be all our successes, and I wish him and his family well,"" Mr Sunak said. ""Whatever our disagreements in this campaign, he is a decent public spirited man who I respect.""    He's fairly new to politics, relatively speaking. Sir Keir started his professional life as a barrister in the 1990s, and was appointed the director of public prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, in 2008. He was first elected in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency in north London in 2015, and took over leadership of Labour after the party's poor 2019 general election, pledging to start a ""new era"" after the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir was re-elected in the same constituency on Thursday, saying in his victory speech people were ""ready for change"" and promising an ""end the politics of performance"". ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community, your future,"" he said. ""You have voted. It's now time for us to deliver."" The Labour leader largely avoided making big pledges during the campaign. But during his address outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said his government would strive to ""rebuild"" British public services such as the NHS, slash energy bills and secure the country's border.  ""You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change,"" he vowed.  You can read Sir Keir's full profile here. This election's insurgent party was Reform UK, the right-wing successor to the Brexit Party and the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage, its leader, finally won a seat on his eighth attempt - but his party's initial projection of 13 seats fizzled to four. That's still better than UKIP and the Brexit Party ever did, and Mr Farage has been celebrating. The party's share of the vote looks to be about 14%. Reform drew controversy during the campaign over offensive statements made by some of its candidates and activists.  Mr Farage will be joined in the House of Commons by former Conservative party deputy chairman Lee Anderson, Reform founder Richard Tice and Rupert Lowe. From their new perch in parliament, the party could seek to cause trouble for the Conservatives and pick off more voters from the party's remaining base.

103,General election 2024 in maps and charts,"The Labour Party has won a landslide majority in the 2024 general election.  The party is set to take 412 seats with a majority of 174, with one result yet to be declared. It is the worst Conservative result in terms of seats in history, with the party forecast to win as few as 122. The Liberal Democrats have their highest tally since 1923, taking 71 seats. The SNP is forecast to finish with 10 seats. Reform UK have five and Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have four each.  Some 23 seats were won by other parties, all in Northern Ireland, and independent candidates. The biggest gap on record has emerged between the share of the vote won nationally by parties and the number of seats they have gained. Labour gained over 200 seats but their vote share increased by less than two percentage points to 34%. The Conservatives saw their vote share plummet by 20 points to 24% and the party lost 251 seats. Reform are in third place by share of the vote on 14% but they found it difficult to convert votes into seats. The party has returned five MPs, including party leader Nigel Farage in Clacton. By contrast, the Liberal Democrats’ 12% vote share translated into 71 seats. The Greens recorded their best ever general election performance, winning four seats and seven per cent of the vote.  This map shows the seats which have been won by a different party to the last general election. To see all the results use the ""Changed hands"" toggle.  All of the new seats Keir Starmer's party took came from constituencies won by either the SNP or the Tories at the last general election. A total of 182 seats changed from blue to red. All of Reform's gains came from seats previously won by the Conservative Party in 2019. Labour lost five seats to independent candidates, including former party leader Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North. Labour also lost one seat, Leicester East, to the Conservatives and Bristol Central to the Greens. The Conservative vote share suffered particularly in areas where high numbers voted to leave the European Union, falling by 27 points in constituencies where more than 60% voted Leave. Labour support in constituencies with large Muslim communities fell about 23 points to 39%. Click through the slides on these maps to see constituency vote share by party. Scotland is the only part of the UK where Labour’s vote share rose sharply. It jumped by 17 points as the party took 36 seats from the SNP. The SNP share of the vote is down 15 points. They also lost three seats to the Liberal Democrats. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, lost his seat in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. The Conservatives lost 12 seats in Wales, meaning they now have no MPs there.  Labour gained nine seats, taking the party's total to 27, despite their share falling by four points. Plaid Cymru has gained two seats, putting the party on four and the Liberal Democrats have taken one seat. Sinn Féin has become Northern Ireland's largest Westminster party, winning all seven seats it won in 2019, while the Democratic Unionist Party lost three of the eight it held at the last general election. In a surprise result, Traditional Unionist Voice took North Antrim from the DUP, unseating Ian Paisley Jr.  Looking at seat and vote share change across broad areas of England, the Conservatives have lost more than 100 seats in the South excluding London and their vote share is down by about 24 points.  Labour has made seat gains in the Midlands, North and South and has also increased its already-strong London tally by seven seats.  The Liberal Democrats have increased their seats in the South by more than 40, their highest regional tally.  Labour and Lib Dem vote shares fell somewhat in London, while hardly changing in the North and Midlands. Vote share for the two parties rose slightly in the South.  Reform share is up in all of these broad regions.  Turnout across the UK as a whole is 60%, the second lowest in a UK election since 1885. Only 2001 was lower with 59%. It was lowest in Wales, where only 56% of the electorate voted. Northern Ireland had a turnout of 57%, Scotland 59% and England 60%. The lowest turnout of any constituency was 40% in Manchester Rusholme, where Afzal Khan held the seat for Labour. The bottom five for turnout also included Leeds South, Hull East, Blaenau Gwent & Rhymney and Tipton & Wednesbury.

101,Talk of easy draw shows 'entitlement' - Southgate,"This video can not be played The England team look in a different place mentally - Southgate England boss Gareth Southgate has warned against an ""entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents"" before Saturday's Euro 2024 quarter-final with Switzerland (17:00 BST). The Three Lions are two wins from the final after avoiding favourites Spain and France on the other side of the draw, meaning England cannot meet them before the showpiece in Berlin on 14 July. On the eve of the last-eight match with Switzerland - live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app - BBC sports editor Dan Roan asked Southgate whether England need to take the opportunity of being in the perceived easier side of the draw. ""We are playing a really strong football nation who have played exceptionally well, have enormous pride,"" said Southgate, who takes charge of his 100th game as boss. ""I would say that is a classic example of the entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents. ""Our focus is on how do we win this game and how do we play to the best of our ability? We have never been to a final outside England, we have only had two finals in our history, three semi-finals.  ""So lots of nations who we might perceive as English people to be smaller have far better records than us in terms of winning things, in getting to the latter stages in finals.  ""It's half of the problem we have. We're ready for tomorrow and, as a team, we have huge respect for our opponents."" Bellingham free to play against Switzerland  'Why three at the back can bring the best out of England' Why England could revert to back three at Euro 2024 England were seconds away from going out of Euro 2024 when Jude Bellingham scored a 95th-minute equaliser against Slovakia in the last 16.  Harry Kane then headed the winner in extra time to set up the quarter-final with Switzerland in Dusseldorf, with the winners facing the Netherlands or Turkey in the semis on Wednesday, 10 July (20:00 BST). England have produced four under-whelming performances at Euro 2024 but Southgate said he expected better against the Swiss. ""I feel that the team, even in training, now look in a different place mentally, they look more fluid,"" he added. ""The longer the players are here, the more belief they have, the less they are being affected by what's outside. They can see the opportunity. ""Every game can take you on a journey, like the game the other night. We have to deliver tomorrow, we have to be ready to go until the last minute again, dig deep in the moments that you have to.  ""They are highly motivated guys and can see the possibility of a semi-final. There is a buzz about them and they are excited to take that challenge on."" This video can not be played 'We all want it' - Will Gareth Southgate make changes? With some fans venting their anger over the team's displays in Germany, Southgate's position has come under scrutiny. In February, the Football Association made it clear they were keen for him to remain in charge beyond Euro 2024. But Southgate, who steered England to the 2018 World Cup semi-final, the Euro 2020 final as well as a World Cup quarter-final in 2022, has yet to sign a new contract, with his current deal due to expire in December. There has been speculation about his future after the tournament - whether England win it or not. ""If you are in one of the most high-profile jobs in world football then there is always going to be speculation, always going to be assessment of what is going on,"" said Southgate. ""I'm not worried. When I was a young manager you are worried if the first job doesn't go well you will never get another job. You worry about failing and getting the sack.  ""I'm older, I'm not worried about losing, what might go wrong. We have an opportunity tomorrow to get to another semi-final.  ""It's about going for it now.""

99,Evenepoel wins time-trial as Pogacar stays in yellow,"Remco Evenepoel won his first Tour de France stage Remco Evenepoel claimed his first victory at the Tour de France in stage seven's individual time-trial as Tadej Pogacar held on to the leader's yellow jersey. The Belgian, who is the current world time trial champion, underlined his credentials as one of the favourites in the general classification, with a superb run on 25.3km course to finish 12 seconds ahead of Slovenia's Pogacar. Evenepoel, 24, who thought he had suffered a puncture on the approach towards the finish in Gevrey-Chambertin, is now just 33 seconds behind Pogacar overall. Another Slovenian, Primoz Roglic was third 34 seconds down, while defending champion Jonas Vingegaard conceded 37 seconds in fourth.  The Dane now trails by one minute and 15 seconds in the GC after also losing time on stage four. Simon Yates was the top-placed British rider in the time-trial, finishing 1:33 behind Evenepoel. The stage win gives Evenepoel, who is wearing the white jersey as the best young rider in the race so far, stage victories in all three Grand Tours. ""It's crazy. I enjoyed every metre of this time trial and coming out with the win was simply amazing,"" said the Soudal-Quick Step rider. ""We wanted a stage win, and that is done. It's a perfect day for me and my team. Mission accomplished. As for the rest of the Tour de France, I believe Tadej is going to be unreachable. But this is cycling, you never know what can happen.  ""I think the further into the race we go, the better I will feel, so I'll focus more on the podium because I feel I have the legs for it."" Before Friday's stage Pogacar had forecast that Evenepoel would be the man to beat in a discipline he excels in.  However, the two-time winner produced a determined ride of his own to extend his advantage over Roglic and Vingegaard, who will now see the mountain stages as their best opportunity to regain ground. ""I can be satisfied,"" Pogacar said.  ""I would have loved to have taken a stage win today but against Remco it's a bit tough. But I  gained time on Primoz [Roglic] and Jonas [Vingegaard] and the other guys so I can be really happy."" On Saturday, the Tour will take a lumpy 183.4km route from Semur-en-Auxois to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises. Stage seven results 1. Remco Evenepoel (Bel/Soudal-Quick Step) 28mins 52secs 2.

98,Champion Alcaraz beats Tiafoe in five-set thriller,"This video can not be played Carlos Alcaraz defeats Frances Tiafoe in five-set thriller Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz avoided a surprise exit at Wimbledon by holding off American Frances Tiafoe in a five-set thriller. The Spaniard won an intense match 5-7 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 in front of a raucous Centre Court crowd. It keeps Alcaraz's hopes of winning back-to-back major titles alive after triumphing at the French Open last month. ""Obviously it is always a big challenge playing against Frances,"" said third seed Alcaraz. ""All I was thinking is 'fight one more ball'."" Friday's first match on the main show court lived up to the pair's previous meeting in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open. Alcaraz was the victor on that occasion as well, beating Tiafoe in a five-set epic on the way to winning his first Grand Slam title. World number one Jannik Sinner is also through to the last 16 after an emphatic 6-1 6-4 6-2 win against Miomir Kecmanovic. This video can not be played 'That was extraordinary!' - Daria Kasatkina tops shots of the day five Tiafoe was seeded 10th at Wimbledon last year, but he has since dropped down the rankings and suffered second-round exits at this year's Australian Open and French Open. Now 29th in the world rankings, he frustrated Alcaraz throughout and received the early backing of the crowd after coming back from a break down to take the opening set. ""He is a really talented player, really tough to face,"" Alcaraz added. ""He deserves to be at the top, he deserves to fight for big things."" Alcaraz, who had not dropped a set at the Championships until then, regained control in the second, but a single break of serve was enough for Tiafoe to win the third. The American waved to the crowd and pointed to his ears, calling for more noise under the closed Centre Court roof. The fans willingly obliged, cheering on the 26-year-old through the fourth set until it reached a tie-break after both players' serve held firm. Sensing the crowd were on his opponent's side, Alcaraz whipped up emotion with cries of ""vamos"" after striking huge winners and he cruised his way through to force a decider. From there it was plain sailing for the three-time major winner, who broke twice before raising his arms in celebration after sealing the victory with a delightful drop shot. He will play American Brandon Nakashima or French 16th seed Ugo Humbert in the fourth round.

Australian Open champion Sinner was one of those to benefit from the use of the show courts, featuring last on Centre Court to book his place in round four. The top seed raced through the first set in 21 minutes and was on course for a bagel after breaking opponent Kecmanovic twice, but the Serbian managed to salvage one game. World number 52 Kecmanovic found his feet in the second set but it was still all on Sinner's terms as he wrapped up the match in one hour and 36 minutes. Sinner will play either American 14th seed Ben Shelton or Canada's Denis Shapovalov next. Shelton leads Shapovalov 3-2 in the first set of their match, which will resume on Saturday at 13:00 BST on Court One after rain halted play on Friday.

104,Man City & Man Utd cleared by Uefa to play in Europe,"Manchester City won the Champions League for the first time in 2023 Manchester City and Manchester United have been cleared to take their places in European competition next season after conflicts over multi-club ownership with Girona and Nice respectively were resolved. However, United will be prevented from signing highly-rated Nice defender Jean-Clair Todibo by Uefa. City Football Group owns City and Girona, while Ineos controls the football operations of United and Nice, and Uefa does not allow clubs with the same ownership to be involved in the same competition. The Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) of European football's governing body said on Friday ""significant changes"" had been made at Girona and Nice which would ""substantially restrict investors' influence and decision-making power"". In addition, shares have been transferred through independent trustees to a blind trust, which will be supervised by the CFCB. Among additional guarantees given by the City Football Group and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos Group to prove the independence of the respective clubs, they agreed not to transfer players ""permanently or on loan, either directly or indirectly from July 2024 to September 2025"". This means United will not be able to sign Frenchman Todibo, the £40m-rated defender Ratcliffe had hoped would switch clubs. However, City's pursuit of Brazilian winger Savio will be unaffected as he has returned to parent club Troyes, who are also part of the City Football Group, after his loan with Girona expired on 30 June. A CFG source told BBC Sport that City and Girona were compliant with all the CFCB requests. Ineos said in a statement: ""We are pleased with the positive decision from the First Chamber of the Uefa Club Financial Control Body which will see Manchester United play in the Europa League next season. The focus for Manchester United is on the season ahead and performance on the pitch."" City will be playing in their 14th consecutive Champions League campaign, but Girona qualified for the first time by finishing third in La Liga, their highest ever league position. Nice also seemed set to qualify for Europe's most prestigious club competition for a long time last season, but eventually finished fifth in Ligue 1. Manchester United qualified for the Europa League by beating Premier League champions City in the FA Cup final. It remains to be seen how the matter is dealt with over the longer term, given the shares are due to be transferred back in July 2025. At that point, CFCB say the clubs will be considered to be ""under the control or decisive influence of their investor"".

105,'Like a Euros final' -  'insatiable' Spain a 'winning horse',"This video can not be played Highlights: Spain 2-1 Germany Spain hero Mikel Merino says their Euro 2024 quarter-final win over hosts Germany could have been a final - and coach Luis de la Fuente compared his team to a ""winning horse"". La Roja edged the battle of the two top-scoring teams and arguably the most impressive in the European Championship so far. Dani Olmo, who played 112 minutes despite starting on the bench, opened the scoring and set up fellow substitute Merino's extra-time winner - with Florian Wirtz levelling for Germany in the 89th minute. Spain will play France in the semi-finals on Tuesday. Real Sociedad midfielder Merino said: ""I'm exhausted. The adrenaline is taking its toll on me now. It's been a unique moment. ""The match we were all waiting for, between two of the best teams in the world. It could be a World Cup final or a European Championship final.  ""We have shown that we know how to suffer, that we have a great team."" Spain score 119th-minute winner to beat hosts Germany and reach semi-final 'A flip of a coin' - tearful Germany suffer 'bitter' exit Spain have been one of the most impressive teams in the Euros, beating 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia and European champions Italy - plus Albania - in the group stage and Georgia in the last 16. Their young wingers Lamine Yamal, who is just 16, and Nico Williams, 21, have been two of the stars of the tournament. But they had to win this one in a different way, with the pair - and striker Alvaro Morata - all replaced at 1-0. De la Fuente said: ""I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable. ""They're used to competing at the highest level and they have an opportunity to win the tournament. ""How far we will get, we will see, but we're absolutely convinced that we can get very far with this side. ""We are so happy, but our euphoria is totally under control. We know tomorrow is already another day."" Spain will be without suspended defenders Dani Carvajal and Robin le Normand for the semi-final - and midfielder Pedri is an injury doubt after going off in the eighth minute for Olmo. Fifteen players were shown cards in the game - the second highest in a European Championship game - with seven for Spain, including Le Normand and Carvajal, who was sent off for two bookings. ""I played in the 80s - if you want to watch a video of the 80s and see how football was played back then, you know I don't get scared. I have a friend who says, 'what do you want, to get kissed?"" De la Fuente said. ""This is football, I am not afraid of these things - the game is played to the limit, I am not complaining about the toughness of the opposing team, I rather appreciate what we as a team have done."" Olmo, who plays in Germany for RB Leipzig and was named man of the match, said: ""The heart is always more important than the legs.  ""Let's take it easy and calmly, because in four days we have the semi-finals. We are going to enjoy, celebrate, but calmly and calmly, because in a few days we have the semi-finals.""

106,Air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16 people,"At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured in the attack on the building which was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Video from the scene shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded. The Israel Defence Force (IDF) said it struck several “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.  The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter. One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit. ""This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning,"" she said. A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. The BBC is unable to verify this claim. In a statement posted to X - formerly known as Twitter - the IDF confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken ""numerous steps"" to ""mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence"". Hamas militants were using the location as a ""hideout"" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said. ""Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,"" it added. Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.  Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel. The latest incidents come after hopes began to rise in recent days that a deal between Israel and Hamas was on the horizon, following months of false starts. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months. A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people. Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the June incident as ""horrific"" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was ""shocking"" but could not be confirmed. Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng04kpv2do,"Rushdi Aboualouf and Tom McArthur,",2024-07-06 20:08:55,
107,Biden interview fails to quell Democrat concerns over fitness,"President Joe Biden's Friday night TV interview does not seem to have quelled an uprising within his own party to end his re-election campaign after a halting debate performance against Donald Trump.  A fifth House Democrat,  Angie Craig of Minnesota, on Saturday joined colleagues in calling for the president to step aside, and reports suggest more could follow. In his rare prime-time ABC News interview, Mr Biden dismissed his debate performance as just a “bad episode” and said only the ""Lord Almighty"" could convince him to end his bid for re-election. Mr Biden, 81, is spending Saturday at his family home in Delaware before two public events on Sunday.  There is growing unease among Democrats, although no senior members of the party have called for him to quit. Some polls show Trump's lead over Mr Biden widening, and many are concerned about losing the presidency and House seats, along with the Senate majority, if he leads the ticket.  Ms Craig, who is running in a competitive district in Minnesota, said on Saturday that she did not believe Mr Biden could ""effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump"".  She said that while she respected his decades of service, ""there is simply too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency"". Minutes after the ABC interview, Texas congressman Lloyd Doggett, the first House Democrat to call for Mr Biden to drop out, said on CNN that the need ""is more urgent tonight than when I first called for it"".  He said the longer it took Mr Biden to make a decision to withdraw, the ""more difficult for a new person to come on board who can defeat Donald Trump"". Other House Democrats including congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts called on Mr Biden to withdraw on Friday.  They join Arizona's Raúl Grijalva's call on Wednesday.  In his interview, Mr Biden declined to take a cognitive test and make the results public to prove he was fit to serve another term. ""I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test - everything I do [is a test],"" he told George Stephanopoulos. This response did not resonate  with Democratic congresswoman Judy Chu of California, who told Politico that his answer was “unsettling and not particularly convincing"" and that she would ""be watching closely... especially in spontaneous situations"". During the 22-minute ABC interview, Mr Biden rejected suggestions allies may ask him to stand aside, saying ""it's not going to happen"".  Mr Stephanopoulos pressed the president on his capacity to serve another term. “I don’t think anybody’s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,"" Mr Biden said.  Mr Biden, who is due to speak at a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, thanked Vice-President Kamala Harris for her support during the ABC News interview.  Ms Harris has emerged as a top contender to replace him if he were to step down. In an interview on Saturday at the Essence black culture festival in New Orleans, the vice-president said that November's election was crucial to American democracy, but made no mention of Democratic disquiet about Mr Biden. Essence was the first of a number events in July that appear to target female black voters, a key constituency for Democrats in November.  However, questions around Mr Biden's candidacy and the potential for Ms Harris to take his place will be difficult to avoid. Ms Harris has spent the last week close to the president, flying from Los Angeles to attend the White House 4 July celebration, sitting in a meeting with governors and Mr Biden, and also being involved in his call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vice-presidents have the delicate balancing act of projecting unequivocal support for their bosses while also tacitly proving they are up for the main job. That has been more so for Ms Harris as questions swirl around Mr Biden's re-election bid. However, some Democrats acknowledge concerns about Ms Harris as a presidential candidate. She struggled to gain her footing early in her vice-presidency as she was given responsibility for issues including immigration, student debt and voting rights.  Low approval ratings have dogged her in office, although they have improved in recent months. She has since refocused her attention on issues such as abortion rights, which Democrats believe will be crucial in November.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8971wl12r8o,"Rachel Looker and Courtney Subramanian,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,
108,Gaza hostage posters torn down outside US politician's office,"Vandals tore down posters of Israeli hostages hung on the wall outside the Capitol Hill office of a Democratic politician on 4 July, his office said on Friday. Congressman Brad Schneider called the the damage ""a vile act of hate"".  The posters included photos of more than 100 people, eight of them Americans, taken as hostages by Hamas during the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.  Capitol police said they were investigating. Mr Schneider, a pro-Israel Democrat from Illinois, posted a photo on Twitter/X showing the posters shredded and thrown across the hall.  ""This was a shameful act on any day, but especially on July 4, our country’s Independence Day,"" he wrote.   ""Sadly, it was but one of many hateful, un-American actions that took place across the country on the day we celebrate freedom and democracy.""  The incident comes less than a week after pro-Palestinian protesters held an overnight rally outside Mr  Schneider's Highland Park home in Illinois. Mr Schneider said masked demonstrators banged drums, blew horns and screamed antisemitic chants outside his home. Police dispersed a crowd of around 40 people after several complaints from neighbours. Mr Schneider said such actions ""play directly into the hands of Hamas terrorists enabling them to continue to hold hostage not only those they kidnapped from Israel, but all civilians in Gaza as well.""  The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Over 100 were released during a November cease-fire.  At least 38,010 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cml2nn9nkmwo,"Rachel Looker,",2024-07-05 23:08:55,
109,"We have too many prisoners, says Britain's new PM","Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to reduce the number of people going to prison through renewed efforts to cut reoffending. In his first press conference as prime minister, Sir Keir said too many people found themselves back in jail ""relatively quickly"" after being sent there. He added that intervening to prevent young people committing knife crime would be an early priority for his new government. But he said there would be no ""overnight solution"" to prison overcrowding, adding: ""We’ve got too many prisoners, not enough prisons."" It comes after he appointed a businessman as his prisons minister who has previously said only a third of prisoners should be there. James Timpson, boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of recruiting ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that ""we're addicted to punishment”. Labour, which won a landslide general election victory on Thursday, has promised to review sentencing after regaining office for the first time since 2010. It has also inherited a ballooning crisis in Britain's jails, and has already committed to keeping the previous Conservative government's early release scheme in place to ease current levels of overcrowding.  Last week the Prison Governors’ Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days. Tory ex-justice secretary Alex Chalk first announced plans to release prisoners early in October 2023. Mr Chalk, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in the general election, told MPs at the time the ""prison population is greater than it has ever been"" and the UK ""must use prison better"". However, he added: ""We must do whatever it takes to always ensure there are always enough prison places to lock up the most dangerous offenders to keep the British public safe."" Details of Labour's review are yet to be unveiled, but Mr Timpson's appointment has offered an early signal that a change of approach may be on the cards in this area. Sir Keir has appointed him a member of the House of Lords, allowing him to take up a post as prisons minister at the Ministry of Justice. The businessman told a Channel 4 podcast in February that prison was a ""disaster"" for around a third of prisoners, and another third ""probably shouldn’t be there"". He said too many people being in prison for ""far too long"" was an example of ""evidence being ignored because there is this sentiment around punish and punish”. ""We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,"" he added. Asked about his comments at a Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir did not offer a view on whether he agreed with those estimates. But he added: ""We do need to be clear about the way in which we use prisons. “For so many people [who] come out of prison, they’re back in prison relatively quickly afterwards. “That is a massive problem that we have in this country, that we do need to break."" He said his party wanted to cut knife crime in particular, and cited his plan to set up a network of ""youth hubs"". Sir Keir, a former lawyer, added: “I’ve sat in the back of I don’t know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. “I’ve often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they’d had support”. Labour says it wants to create 20,000 prison places by enabling ministers to override local councils on planning decisions.  But it also plans to keep in place the scheme implemented by the last government under which some lower-level offenders can be released up to 70 days early. Sir Keir said Conservative ministers had created a ""mess"" by failing to build enough prisons and mismanaging the prisons budget. Defending his decision to keep the early-release scheme in place, he added: ""We don’t have the prisons we need, and I can’t build a prison within 24 hours."" The latest official figures, published on Friday, put the prison population of England and Wales at 87,453 out of a ""useable operational capacity"" of 88,864. The SNP-run Scottish government, responsible for prisons in Scotland, plans to release between 500 and 550 inmates in the coming months. It comes as Sir Keir convened the first Labour cabinet meeting in 14 years,  telling his top team he expects them to hold themselves and their departments to the ""highest standards of integrity and honesty"". A Downing Street readout from the meeting said the prime minister told ministers ""the whole country was looking to the government to deliver on their priorities"". Following the cabinet, Sir Keir was grilled by journalists at his first press conference as PM. Asked about tax hikes, Sir Keir said he would take ""tough decisions"" and face challenges with ""raw honesty"". The new Labour government faces tough choices on public finances, with forecasts suggesting major spending cuts. But Thursday's landslide victory in the General Election has given Labour ""a clear mandate to govern for all four corners of the United Kingdom,"" Sir Keir said as he set out plans to tour all four UK nations in the coming days. Saturday also saw the final result of the general election, with the Lib Dems winning the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 BST on Friday, but a recount meant the results were delayed until Saturday afternoon. Candidate Angus MacDonald gained a majority of 2,160 over the SNP's Drew Hendry. It means the Lib Dems have won 72 Westminster seats. Six of these are in Scotland, meaning the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish Conservatives as Scotland's third largest party in Westminster.  Across the UK, Labour won 412 seats while the Conservatives were on 121.  ",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16jpkzz9g3o,"Paul Seddon,",2024-07-06 19:08:55,
111,French far right seeks vote win but deadlock looms,"France votes in one of its most significant elections in years on Sunday, with the far right hoping for a historic victory, but political stalemate the more likely result. This is the first time the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella has had a realistic chance of running the government and taking outright control of the National Assembly. But after the RN’s first-round victory in snap parliamentary elections last Sunday, hundreds of rival candidates dropped out to give others a better chance of defeating the far right. Voting begins in mainland France at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and the first exit polls will be released 12 hours later. Whatever the result, it is difficult to see President Emmanuel Macron coming out of this well. Four weeks ago, he said it was the responsible solution to call a snap vote in response to the RN’s victory in European elections, minutes after the party’s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella challenged him to do so. The two-round election came as a shock to a country gearing up for the start of the Paris Olympics on 26 July. Security was already tight and now 30,000 police have been deployed for a period of heightened political tension. There are fears of violence in Paris and other French cities, whatever the outcome of the vote, and a planned protest outside the National Assembly on Sunday evening has been banned. In Dreux, a historic old town on the road to Normandy, Sunday’s vote falls on the day the Olympic flame is passing through. “For us it’s a massive thing, bigger than the election,” says Pauline in the tourist office. The flame has been travelling around France for almost two months, and Dreux has planned a weekend of festivities to mark its arrival. “Macron should have waited until after the Olympics,” Dreux resident Antoine told the BBC. Veteran commentator Nicolas Baverez believes the president has not just blown up his term in office and opened the gates of power wide for the far right. “He’s compromised the running of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which could deliver a final blow to France’s credit and its image,” he wrote in Le Point on the eve of the vote. The constituency that includes Dreux is one of the races to watch in the second round of this election.  Candidates such as Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already won their seats, by winning more than half the vote. But another 500 contests are being decided in run-offs, mostly involving either two or three candidates. Former conservative cabinet minister Olivier Marleix was beaten in the first round by far-right candidate Olivier Dubois. They both qualified for the run-off, along with a candidate from the left-wing New Popular Front, which is in second place nationally. But because Nadia Faveris was narrowly beaten into third by her conservative rival, she pulled out of the race “to block National Rally”. One voter, Morgan, was sceptical that anything would change in the town, whoever won. There have been 217 of these withdrawals across France, including 130 Popular Front candidates and 81 from the president’s Ensemble alliance. And that has dramatically changed the balance of this pivotal general election. Projections after Sunday’s first round gave the RN a fighting chance of securing an outright majority of 289 seats, but final opinion polls on Friday suggest that is now out of reach, with 205 to 210 seats as a potential maximum. The parties trying to block an RN victory range from the radical left, Communists and Greens to the Macron centrists and conservatives. They say they are defending the Fifth Republic from the extreme policies of the far right. National Rally has watered down many of its policies but still wants to give French citizens “national preference” over immigrants for jobs and housing. It aims to abolish the right of automatic citizenship to the children of immigrants who have spent five years aged 11 to 18 in France. It also wants to bar dual nationals from dozens of sensitive jobs. Opinion polls are not necessarily reliable. Each of the 500 races is a local contest and voters do not follow recommendations from political parties. If the RN managed upwards of 250 seats, it might seek out allies to form a minority government. President Macron's party had to make do with similar numbers until he became frustrated with his limited ability to pass reforms in parliament. That kind of RN government is unlikely, believes Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris. It would soon face a vote of no confidence, he believes, and under the constitution, France cannot have another general election for at least another year. Another potential scenario is a “grand coalition” that would involve most of the other parties, except for the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party, which the Macron alliance and conservatives reject as extremists. This idea has gained some momentum in recent days, but Greens leader Marine Tondelier has made clear “there’ll be no Macronist prime minister”, whatever happens. There is also talk of a technocrat government, similar to those that ran Italy during the eurozone debt crisis. But instead of choosing experts from outside politics, it might include politicians with proven expertise in particular fields. In any case, France is entering uncharted territory, says Jean-Yves Dormagen of the Cluster 17 institute. President Macron himself has said he is not about to resign and will continue to serve out his final three years in office. “We will have Macron as a lame duck president who created this mess without having to do so,” Prof Steinbach told the BBC. “And he’s losing legitimacy.” The immediate concern for France is to have some kind of government in place during the Olympic Games. Constitutional expert Benjamin Morel believes the president could form a national unity government until the end of the Paris Games. “That would give the parties time to to reach an agreement between now and the start of the school year and the next budget,” he told Le Figaro.",2024-07-06 23:08:55,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw0ygnyxgnqo,"Paul Kirby,",2024-07-06 18:08:55,
112,"Air strike leaves 100,000 without power in Ukraine","A Russian attack on a power facility in Ukraine has left 100,000 people without power in the north-western region of Sumy. Work is under way to restore power, National grid operator Ukrenergo said, following the strikes, which caused emergency shut-offs for consumers in the city and region of Sumy, which borders Russia. There were no reports of casualties or damage apart from the energy facility, Reuters reports. Russia continues to pummel energy facilities across Ukraine, often plunging the country into extended blackouts with people enduring sweltering summer conditions without running water, air conditioning, or life-saving medical equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says, losing all of its thermal power plants to enemy action and seeing all hydroelectric sites damaged by drones or missile strikes.  This is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption, and more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, according to the national grid operator. Poland has been diverting surplus electricity to Ukraine to help it cope with the Russian strikes, but Ukrenego has scheduled cut-offs of electricity throughout the day across the country as domestic generation and electricity imports could not cover the deficit. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo told the BBC she is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it is obvious why: all our life, all our civilisation, is built on electricity,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian air defences shot down 24 out of 27 Shahed kamikaze drones Russia launched on the night of 5-6 July, the Air Force Command has reported on Telegram.

113,Cyclist fined for kissing wife during Tour de France,"French cyclist Julien Bernard has given a light-hearted apology after being fined for kissing his wife during a Tour de France time trial.  The Lidl-Trek rider was made to pay 200 Swiss francs ($223; £174) by the International Cycling Union (UCI) for stopping briefly during stage seven of the race. The governing body said the fine was for ""unseemly or inappropriate behaviour during the race and damage to the image of the sport"".  Writing on social media, Bernard apologised to the UCI for ""having damaged the image of sport"" but said he was willing to pay the fine ""every day and relive this moment"".  Stage seven of the Tour de France is a short course of 23.3km (14.5 miles) and is one of two time trials in the race - where cyclists race against the clock for the best time. The climb takes place in the famous wine region of Burgundy. According to Cycling News, Bernard was just 30 minutes from where he lives when he was met by his supporters. As he reached the top of a climb, friends ran towards him holding signs and his wife stepped forward - at which point she gave him a quick kiss, holding their son who was dressed in a replica cycling kit.  A fine for the same amount and for breaking the same rule was given earlier in the race to Italian cyclist Davide Ballerini, after he stopped to watch Britain's Mark Cavendish sprint to a record-breaking 35th Tour de France stage victory.  In a television interview following the stage, Bernard said the encounter with his loved ones had been a unique moment in his career and he had pushed hard earlier in the stage so he would have enough time to do so.  ""It was really incredible. My wife has been organising this with some friends for a few weeks now and she did a really, really good job,"" he said.

126,"Rescue street dogs, or euthanise them? Turks split over its strays","Under the shade of a leafy green apricot tree on a scorching summer afternoon, Gokcen Yildiz scoops up a squirming ball of light-brown fur. It licks her all over the face and she breaks out in giggles.  But laughter gives way to a more serious tone as she points to the dog's back legs, which are missing paws. A sign, she says, of the abuse some of Turkey’s street dogs are subjected to. Ms Yildiz is a secondary school physics teacher by day, street-dog advocate by night. The canine she’s holding is one of 160 she’s collected on the property where she lives on the outskirts of Turkey’s capital city, Ankara. Her dogs are a small fraction of the estimated four million that make up the country’s street-dog population. It’s a problem that has fiercely divided public opinion: are stray dogs a neighbourhood fixture to be looked after and loved?  Or does the government need to take more drastic solutions, like those state media are reporting that it's considering - including euthanasia? On her 15,000 sq m property, Ms Yildiz looks after elderly and disabled dogs, and those with psychological or behavioural issues. “It is not my job, but I look after dogs in need,” she said. “I always experience financial worry because the economy is getting harder. When the price of petrol increases, everything like pet food or the medicine I give, or the vet expenses - everything goes up.” She said she feels anxious about finances, but her bigger concern is what will happen to the dogs if she doesn’t collect them. “The dogs outside of here eat every two or three days, but they’re alive. They’re not about to die. That’s what really worries me,” she said. Lawmakers from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) are working on a new bill aimed at getting dogs off the streets. It hasn’t yet been introduced into the country’s parliament, but state media report it could require municipalities to collect stray dogs, shelter them for around 30 days, and if the animals are not adopted in that time, euthanise them. The latter provision has outraged animal rights activists - and Turkey’s dog lovers, like Ms Yildiz - but it’s also raised questions about whether existing facilities across the country could handle additional responsibilities. Only about one third of the nation’s provincial and district municipalities have shelters, according to Doctor Murat Arslan, president of the Turkish Veterinary Medical Association. He said this had been one of the problems with an existing law, which requires dogs to be sterilised and then returned to the streets where they lived. “In order to manage the animal population, street dogs needed to be collected, sterilised, given some vaccinations, and then released back to the street. However, not every municipality had shelters or facilities where these operations could be carried out. Especially in small municipalities, there are neither shelters nor sufficient employment of veterinarians.” If this law, enacted 20 years ago, had been enforced, the street-dog population wouldn’t be so large today, Dr Arslan said. Animal abandonment and overbreeding and selling of dogs had also allowed the street-dog population to rise, he told the BBC. Although animals are microchipped and registered in a centralised database, officials needed to be better at following through with fines for owners when animals were found to have been thrown out on the street, he added. Regardless of what led to the problem, campaign groups like Safe Streets Association argue a solution is needed to take dogs permanently off the street. Attorney Meltem Zorba is a volunteer for Safe Streets. She works with families that have been victims of stray-dog attacks, and points to government statistics that show over the past five years, street dogs have contributed to 55 deaths, more than 5,000 injuries, and 3,500 traffic accidents. “We have been pressuring for legal change for three years,” she said. “There should not be stray dogs on the streets. These attacks on people causing death, traffic accidents, and other animals being attacked are unacceptable.” She’s calling for a legal requirement to take dogs off the streets for good - rather than the catch-and-release protocol in place now. Ms Zorba also says the dogs pose other concerns including rabies and public health issues arising from dog faeces in public places, such as parks and playgrounds. “This is rationality,” she said of the creation of new legislation, adding that euthanasia should be a last resort and a result of an animal being deemed too sick or posing a risk to society. That’s where a national consensus seems to be building. A recent opinion poll showed nearly 80% of respondents supported measures to take dogs off the street and provide shelter. But less than 3% believed collected dogs should be euthanised. Both Ms Zorba and Ms Yildiz support a government solution that would allow dogs to be taken off the streets, collected in newly-built shelters around the country, sterilised, and looked after through the end of their lives, if not adopted. It’s believed that ministers plan to provide local authorities with fresh funds to implement any new law on stray dogs. But it’s unclear whether the government - already dealing with an economic crisis that’s seen inflation climb to 75% this year - has the resources available for such a solution.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnl020jvyppo,"Victoria Craig,",2024-07-06 00:08:56,

Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir spoke to the BBC about the secrets of their happiness, and about why so many marriages fail in the northern city of Kano, in a video that has generated much comment. Mr Yusuf puts it down to his wife’s generous nature. “She is a very unselfish person and she overlooks a lot which has contributed to the success of our marriage,” the 76-year-old told BBC Hausa. This prompts a smile from Ms Tahir, who is in her late sixties. Together the couple have had 13 children - and she praised her husband’s ability to remain calm in the face of the difficulties all families confront. “He is a very patient man and I feel that was also key to our success,” she said. The pair say they love and respect each other - and they clearly enjoy each other’s company, breaking off to laugh several times during the interview. For Hassana Mahmud, it is a revelation. The 39-year-old divorcee has been married five times and is impressed by the couple and their evident contentment. ""In all my marriages I have only spent four years with a spouse - so to see them on social media celebrating this milestone was refreshing,” she said.  “My husbands were all nice and caring during courtship but changed after the wedding,"" said the mother of four. “I feel bad whenever I hear people call Kano 'the divorce capital of Nigeria', I hope things will change,"" she added. Kano gained the epithet after divorce rates began to rise in the 1990s and it has not been able to shake off the unwanted label. Hundreds of marriages collapse each month in Nigeria’s most populous state, whose capital, Kano city, is the commercial hub of the north. In 2022 research done by the BBC in collaboration with the local government disclosed that 32% of marriages in Kano state only survive between three and six months. It also revealed that some people aged between 20 and 25 had already gone through three marriages. The scale of separations is a concern - especially for the Hisbah, a Kano state-funded Islamic agency that deals with moral issues and enforces Sharia, or Islamic law in the state. It has a police unit that enforces things like segregation in public places and an alcohol ban for Muslims, who make up the majority of residents. It also has a counselling service mainly to help struggling married couples. Long lines of women can often be seen queueing outside its offices to complain that their ex-husbands are not helping with maintenance for their children. People tend to marry young in Kano - often before the legal age of 18. Others feel Islam’s easy method of divorce might be a factor as husbands can simply tell their wives: “I divorce you” or write that on a piece of paper and it is over. Nowadays a message sent on social media is enough to end their marriage. Aminu Daurawa works for the Hisbah to address the high divorce rate. One of their solutions is to offer a second chance to people and better prepare them for married life. The agency organises mass marriages, known as “Auren Zawarawa”, mainly for divorcees - acting as a matchmaker on a giant scale. The hundreds of newly wed couples, who are treated to a big wedding ceremony, are also offered a small sum to help them set up a business and other household goods. This initiative began in 2012 - though Mr Daurawa acknowledges divorce rates are still high. “We know about that problem - that is why we set up a committee to check on each couple after the marriage so we don't get the former [same] results,” he said. But Hadiza Ado, founder of non-governmental organisation Women and Children Initiative, says the number of divorces continue to rise. “At the moment we get up to 30 marital cases daily in our various offices,” she told the BBC. “The troubling Nigerian economy is the number-one reason at the moment. “Husbands go out to make ends meet and sometimes come back home empty-handed, which causes rifts.” The practice of using matchmakers is common in Kano because in a Muslim society single people do not mix, so it is difficult to meet potential partners.  The only place that the sexes mix would be at university or other tertiary institutions, which most people do not attend. When people are matched together they often get married hardly knowing each other. In fact Mahmud Kabir Yusuf and Rabiatu Tahir were introduced as youngsters by an older woman in their neighbourhood. She was the one who felt they would be a good match - but they did not tie the knot for another 12 years, giving them ample time to get to know one another. One man with a reputation for making successful matches says that is key. “A lot of investigation needs to be done before marriage to know the persons involved,” Rabiu Ado told the BBC. He set up as a matchmaker 10 years ago. The 46-year-old had not intended to become a marriage broker, though it had been the job of his mother. He was working as a truck driver when he was approached by friends complaining about the difficulty of finding a partner. After making some successful introductions, he realised he had a knack for the family business. He now has billboards advertising his services - and gets between one and five clients each day. He interviews them and gets to know their attitudes and expectations. Often men want a woman who can make money and women want rich men. “A lot of people go into marriages with the wrong mindset, which is why they get disappointed after some time.” He says he has organised around 500 marriages over the last decade, with a success rate of more than 90%. He counsels couples to always take time to know each other well before marrying. Mr Ado, who has the nickname ""Mai Dalili"" meaning ""He who makes it happen"", says the high number of divorces means some people don't take marriage seriously. “I feel why divorce is high in Kano is because people feel I can always get another person after a divorce.” Islamic cleric Abdullahi Ishaq Garangamawa defends the ease with which Muslims can get a divorce. “Islam is merciful and made marriages and divorces not hard so that people will not be caged when things aren't going right,” he told the BBC. ""In the past we didn't have this many divorces as our parents were married for decades. It was in recent times that people started abusing the process for selfish interests,"" he says. ""But in essence, unlike in some religions where it's till death no matter the situation, Islam legalises divorce when things get out of hand."" Mr Yusuf, who used to work for the now-defunct Nigeria Airways, says sharing life’s difficulties and helping one another has been crucial to his enduring partnership with Ms Tahir. “Love is also key because when you love each other genuinely you tend to stay together. “My advice to people getting married is not to get into it for selfish reasons but go into it with genuine intentions.” His wife agrees, adding: “My own advice is that people wanting to get married have to be patient with each other - if one partner is angry, the other should be calm.” Additional reporting by Abba Awwalu Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

118,Junta chiefs 'turn their backs' on West Africa bloc,"Niger's military leader, speaking alongside the junta chiefs from Mali and Burkina Faso, has said they are ""irrevocably"" turning their backs on the wider West African bloc, Ecowas. The three men are meeting together for the first time to cement an alliance created in the face of opposition from neighbouring countries. Soldiers took power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in a series of coups from 2020 to 2023. All three countries – which now form the Alliance of Sahel States - have been affected by jihadist violence, in part a reason given for the army takeovers.  In January, they all announced a plan to leave Ecowas, which is holding its own summit on Sunday. Speaking at Saturday’s meeting in the Nigerien capital, Niamey, the country's leader, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, said that in the place of Ecowas, the junta chiefs wanted to build a community of sovereign peoples ""far from the control of foreign powers. A community of peace, solidarity, prosperity based on our African values.” Gen Tchiani is hosting the talks with Burkina Faso’s Capt Ibrahim Traoré and Mali’s Col Assimi Goïta. In a message on X, the Burkinabé leader said that ""together, we will consolidate the foundations of our true independence"". Speaking at the summit, Capt Traoré went on to say that ""this continent has suffered and continues to suffer from the fire of the imperialists. These imperialists have only one cliché in mind: 'Africa is the empire of slaves'."" Security co-operation is high on the agenda, but the alliance, known by its French acronym AES, will also look towards forming closer economic ties, including the aim of creating a common currency. This would be a rejection of the France-backed CFA Franc, which is used in many states across the region. All three countries have expelled French soldiers who were there as part of an anti-jihadist mission and turned towards Russia for military assistance. Calls for greater sovereignty and a rejection of the former colonial power have been a key part of the rhetoric coming from the junta leaders. The countries have also resisted calls from Ecowas for a rapid return to civilian rule. Capt Traoré arrived in Niamey a day ahead of the meeting and was welcomed with an enthusiastic reception. Television pictures show cheering crowds waving Nigerien and Burkinabé flags. Among them was Sidi Mohamed, the head of the National Youth Council. ""Today, as Africans, we are very proud to see a summit where it's an African summit, a summit where states have decided to pool their energies, to pool their forces to create an alliance for their development, without any foreign stakeholders, without any counterparts from the powers that are used to ruling over us,” he told journalists. Col Goïta arrived on Saturday. The presidents of the wider West African bloc will have their chance to respond at a heads of state meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on Sunday. They are also due to announce the activation of a standby force to fight regional insecurity. Over the past decade, the Sahel has become an increasing focus of Islamic State militant activity, creating insecurity and instability. The juntas in Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali have so far failed to quell the violence. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

129,'I'm worried' - Democrats at Biden rally open to change,"The hundreds of die-hard Democrats who turned out to see Joe Biden in Wisconsin on Friday didn’t need much convincing. The US president received an enthusiastic response to his loudly delivered remarks at the rally in Madison, especially when he attacked his Republican rival Donald Trump. But as some major Democratic donors and lawmakers call on Mr Biden to exit the presidential race, even some of his most ardent supporters here in Madison are keeping an open mind about whether he might be replaced - and what might come next. “It’s OK to change our minds,” said Catherine Emmanuelle, 44, who paused and considered her thoughts carefully before outlining her opinion.  She stressed that she was impressed with Mr Biden’s 17-minute speech, which she called a “presidential litmus test”. “But if something happens in three days or a week or three weeks, we shouldn’t be afraid of having a conversation about change,” she told BBC News. Mr Biden is under tremendous scrutiny after a disastrous debate performance last week, marked by a hoarse voice and several instances where he lost his train of thought. The president, 81, is facing a tide of doubts about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump, 78, in November's election.  Friday’s rally, held in this reliably Democratic town in a critical swing state, was an indication of the support Mr Biden still has in many parts of the country. But the raucous crowd, which waited through several opening speakers and a hour-long delay from the planned start time, was also shot through with low-grade anxiety. “I’m worried about his capacity to beat Trump,” said Thomas Leffler, a 33-year-old health researcher.  ""As he gets older, I think it’s going to increasingly be an issue. But I’ll vote blue no matter what,"" he said - a reference to the Democratic Party's signature colour.  Mr Leffler suggested that picking a new candidate might have unexpected benefits. “If you go through some sort of open process, you can re-energise people, and show that there’s a process better than what Republicans have, which is basically just to bow down to Donald Trump,” he said. Earlier this year, both the president and Trump secured the delegates needed to be their party's respective presumptive candidates. The Democrats' nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from 19-22 August. On Friday, Mr Biden was defiant about staying in the race, telling the crowd: ""I am running and going to win again.” Some of the biggest cheers on Friday came when the president directly went after his predecessor. “Trump is not just a convicted criminal,” he said. “He’s a one man crime wave.” The prospect of a second Trump administration was an animating factor for many who came to the rally. “During the debate, he told a bunch of lies,” said Greg Hovel, 67. “How is that any worse than what Biden did?” Mr Hovel said he believed the country was in a “great place” and that Mr Biden didn’t get enough credit for his economic and pandemic recovery policies. “At this point, in the next six weeks, the Democratic Party is going to have to make up its mind” whether to retain Mr Biden as their candidate or pick someone new, he said. But the president’s performance on Friday further bolstered something he strongly believed, even before the speech. “I think Biden can win,” he said.

130,'We've learnt to do surgery without electricity': Ukraine's power cuts worsen,"Power supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son.  He was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication. ""We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,” Tetiana tells the BBC. Ukrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country. Persistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day. Tetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant.  She has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down. Power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too. ""Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,” she says. “My son can die if he doesn't get oxygen. I'm lost for words.” Recent blackouts have lasted as long as 12 hours a day in Tetiana's neighbourhood. For millions of Ukrainians, the absence of power can mean no running water, air conditioning, lifts or access to life-saving equipment. Over the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says. This is more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. It is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption – or Slovakia, Lavtia, Lithuania and Estonia combined, Ukrenergo says. ""All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. All hydropower plants in our country are damaged by Russian missiles or drones,"" Ukrenergo spokeswoman Maria Tsaturian tells the BBC. The lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems. To cope with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country, which last for many hours a day every day. As a result, millions of Ukrainians have become increasingly reliant on fuel-powered generators or big power banks. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been experiencing lengthy power cuts. Roksolana was elected by residents of her 24-storey apartment block to help run the building's facilities. She says living in tower blocks is not easy because power cuts also mean no running water on the upper floors. “The lifts are not working either, so mothers with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on when there is electricity,” she adds. “They've got to stay indoors for six hours on end, our elderly ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread."" Such residents in tall buildings are stuck inside their sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working.  They are also more exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go to the safety of the bomb shelters, which are typically located underground. In Zaporizhzhia, dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv says appointments have to be rescheduled at the last moment, and there've been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery. ""If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have started. There's no other way - we can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow,"" he says. ""Literally a couple of weeks ago power cuts became particularly frequent. Of course they're very disruptive."" To perform urgent or less complicated operations during blackouts, Mr Stefaniv uses a head torch. This is a skill he acquired and perfected while treating soldiers on the front line, and his firm still provides free or heavily discounted services for members of the Ukrainian army. ""I can treat toothache or swelling without electricity. We've learnt to perform surgery without electricity,"" he says. Maria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option. ""We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it's obvious why: all our life, all our civilization, is built on electricity. You just have to destroy your enemy's power grid, and they will have no economy, and they will have no life,” she says. “This is the price we pay for freedom.""",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c724532nqyno,"Vitaly Shevchenko,",2024-07-05 23:08:56,
128,Inside Keir Starmer's preparations for power,"“A face of thunder.” As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the State Opening of Parliament deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives’ plans laid out year after year. He carried the curse of the leader of the opposition – irrelevance. He formally became prime minister at lunchtime on Friday, but for a number of months now, he has also known that the British state has been quietly preparing for his arrival in Downing Street. “We have every hour of his first day, every day of his first week, every week of his first month, mapped out,"" is how one Whitehall source put it. What promise this victory holds is not going to fail because of a lack of homework or planning. Such is the level of preparation that the Treasury, in anticipation of the arrival of the first female chancellor, has apparently boxed in the urinal that has long been a feature of the chancellor’s private bathroom. Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!). Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.  Rachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir’s team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: “We have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.“ The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into “implementation plans"" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: “It’s ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget” without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys. Despite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir’s mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. “There are no secrets,” one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a “vote for a more radical, bold approach”. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change “proves” Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to No 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won’t be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through. And it’s likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government’s independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space. The Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair’s frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: “I so deeply regret that we didn’t hit the ground running on reform."" “Keir has taken this incredibly seriously,"" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet’s been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.  I’m told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: “They come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet – that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, ‘now, can I talk to you about the end of the world!’” Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he’s also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should ""Go quick! Go fast, before they find the loos!"" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don’t stay eager forever. Labour’s scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn’t make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away.  Whenever she’s been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the ""worst economic inheritance since the Second World War"" or as she said at her election count in Leeds ""there is not a huge amount of money"". Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters’ clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: “Things really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside."" Labour’s ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: “From today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.” A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories’ fault. What of the new PM himself? It’s not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it’s a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as “nauseating” pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase “moral socialism”. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a “force for good and a force for change“. That’s a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who’s been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. “He’ll be the most normal PM we’ve ever had,” says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. “He is theirs,” the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he’ll return politics to serve the people through what he terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw. It was Sir Keir’s belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer’s friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a “decade of renewal“. Just before polling day, one insider joked: “I’m never not thinking about winning the next election.” By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more “face of thunder” for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.

115,Kimchi blamed for mass sickness in South Korea,"About 1,000 people in South Korea are suffering from food poisoning linked to kimchi contaminated with norovirus. Officials in Namwon City, in the south-west of the country, announced on Friday morning that there had been 996 confirmed cases - although local media reports say that number had climbed to 1,024 by early Saturday afternoon. Authorities said the popular fermented cabbage dish had been distributed to those now sick through school meals in the city. They added that students and staff from 24 schools were among the patients with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. Norovirus is very contagious and can be caught through touching contaminated surfaces - such as toilet flush handles - and from people who are already infected. Most people recover in a few days without needing hospital treatment, but some become very ill. Namwon City officials said it began an epidemiological investigation to uncover the source of the illness on Wednesday, after the first case was reported the previous day. Since then, the number of cases grew rapidly - rising from 153 on Wednesday to 745 on Thursday. In a social media post on Thursday, the city's Mayor, Choi Kyung-sik, said that health officials had adopted a ""pre-emptive and excessive response"" in an attempt to prevent further spread of the illness. ""We will ensure the safety of our citizens,"" he added. City officials said norovirus had been detected among patients, through environmental samples and in some of the kimchi regularly delivered to schools. As a result, its disaster and safety department had temporarily suspended the production and sale of any products from the company that made the kimchi - which is also in the process of voluntarily recalling products that have already been distributed. The firm that produced the kimchi has not yet been officially named.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58m22ljrro,"Aleks Phillips,",2024-07-06 14:08:56,
122,"Sam Carling: Meet the new youngest MP, born in 2002","A 22-year-old elected as an MP with a razor-thin majority has said he does not want his age to be the focus as he heads to Westminster. Labour’s Sam Carling is likely to be the ""baby of the House"" - the unofficial title given to the youngest member of the House of Commons - after narrowly winning North West Cambridgeshire. The Cambridge University science graduate student beat veteran Conservative MP Shailesh Vara by 39 votes to take the seat. Mr Carling called his victory a ""political earthquake"", and said he hoped more young people would stand for public office. ""Then they will see themselves represented, both in Parliament and local councils. It will help tackle apathy,"" he said. The previous ""baby of the House"" was Oxford University graduate and fellow Labour MP Keir Mather, who won the Selby and Ainsty by-election in 2023. Mr Carling, who has been a councillor in Cambridge, said many voters were surprised to discover he was running for office, but that ""people on the doorstep were very positive"". ""They said ‘That’s good, we need more young people’. ""There is a lot of abuse aimed at younger people online, but face-to-face, people are generally thrilled to find out."" However, he doesn't want his age to be a focus. ""I want us to get away from this strange mindset towards younger people’s age. As far as I’m concerned we’re just the same as anyone else. I just want to get on with the job."" He only recently became interested in politics, saying he saw a connection between social and economic decline and ""decisions made in Westminster"". Mr Carling grew up in a rural town in the north-east of England, which he described as ""a very deprived area"". ""I saw a lot of things getting worse around me. I was concerned about shops closing on local high streets that used to be a thriving hub and are basically now a wasteland.

119,What can we learn from Starmer's first day as PM?,"The last time I recall a cabinet meeting on a Saturday was during the Brexit years and the time before that was due to the Falklands War. In other words, they are rare. This one was about cracking on, and being seen to crack on, with the job of government with a momentum and energy. Standing in Downing Street and watching and talking to ministers – as we will get used to calling them – there was a first day at school vibe. Easy smiles, time to chat with the security staff, an excitement to clutch a red ministerial folder.  The novelty will no doubt wear off for them, and the slog of governing kick in. But this time, at least, there was a knowing awareness of the magnitude of this moment for them. It is 14 years since Labour ministers wandered around in Downing Street. And it is 27 years since they last kicked the Conservatives out of office. A couple of hours later Sir Keir Starmer looked comfortable, even relaxed, in the role of prime minister in his first news conference. Us reporters were led to the State Dining Room in the heart of No10, rather than the specially designed room in No9 built by the last government and associated in particular with rows about parties during the pandemic. These kinds of things do not happen by accident and who knows if this government will use the newer room on camera in future, but it was a visual marker of change. Sir Keir claimed to us that his government would confront the challenges it confronts with what he called a “raw honesty”. He and his ministers have already described prisons and the NHS in England as “broken”. How long there will be a patience with them blaming their predecessors, let’s see. What we will see next – and has been telegraphed in advance – is a blitz of activity and travel from the prime minister. It turns out that when you win a general election the meeting, greeting, dashing and smiling roadshow doesn’t end with a trip to the polling station. Sir Keir will travel to Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff in the next day or so and will meet England’s mayors on Tuesday. After that it will be a flight to Washington DC for the annual summit of the Nato defence alliance. A chance for the prime minister to meet fellow world leaders – and to be on a stage only presidents and prime ministers get an invite to. The week after (in other words, inside the next fortnight) there will be a King’s Speech – the State Opening of Parliament – where the government will set out its planned new laws. And then Keir Starmer will welcome around 50 fellow European leaders to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire the day after, for a meeting of what is known as the European Political Community, a new-ish body separate from the European Union. A whopping majority after offering “change” – coupled with a low turnout and a share of the vote lower than any other single-party post-war government – may afford this administration little time to demonstrate, if it can, that it is capable of delivery. There are determined not to waste any time.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c728egw36gdo,"Chris Mason,",2024-07-06 20:08:56,
117,Murray's Wimbledon career over as Raducanu pulls out of doubles,"Andy Murray is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event Andy Murray's Wimbledon career is over after Emma Raducanu pulled out of their planned appearance in the mixed doubles. Former world number one Murray, 37, was due to play alongside his fellow Briton on Saturday evening at the All England Club. Raducanu, 21, said she has ""some stiffness"" in her right wrist. She moved into the fourth round of the women's singles with a dominant two-set win over Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari on Friday. ""I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles,"" she said. ""I’m disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but I've got to take care."" This video can not be played Wimbledon tribute - The best moments of Andy Murray Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, was playing at SW19 for the last time before retiring later this year. The Scot is said to be ""disappointed"" that he is unable to play alongside 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, who missed Wimbledon last year after having surgery on both wrists. Murray's mother Judy, in response to a post on X from television presenter Marcus Buckland describing Raducanu's decision as ""astonishing"", wrote: ""Yes, astonishing."" Murray was not permitted to find a replacement partner for Raducanu under tournament rules because the draw had already been made. Murray and Raducanu, who were set to play China's Zhang Shuai and El Salvador's Marcelo Arevalo, have been replaced by an alternate pairing. It means Murray made his final appearance on Thursday when he lost alongside older brother Jamie in the men's doubles. A video montage of Murray's career was played on the Centre Court big screen after the match, leaving the former world number one in tears as thousands of fans showed their appreciation. Murray pulled out of the singles on Tuesday as he continues to recover from a back operation on 22 June. The three-time major champion is planning to retire later this year, with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games set to be his final event. 'Compelling on and off court' - a decade on tour with Murray 'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Wimbledon Saturday’s schedule played a major part in Emma Raducanu's decision. Being asked to play in the fourth match of the day on Court One is the same as being asked to play in a night session. And given this Grand Slam is a predominantly daytime event, you can understand why a player would not want to spend all evening on site with a fourth-round singles match the following day. The schedule put Raducanu in a very awkward position, and has led to a decision which will be very disappointing for Murray and everyone looking forward to what would have been a fun finale to his Wimbledon career. This was no ordinary mixed doubles pairing, although players do regularly prioritise singles over doubles. And there can be no change of partner once the draw is made. So instead of Murray teaming up with another British player, American alternates Rajeev Ram and Katie Volynets come into the draw.

116,Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian elected Iran's president,"Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian has been elected as Iran's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili.  The vote was declared in Dr Pezeshkian's favour after he secured 53.3% of the more than 30 million votes counted. Mr Jalili polled at 44.3%.  The run-off came after no candidate secured a majority in the first round of the election on 28 June, which saw a historically low voter turnout of 40%. The election was called after Iran’s previous president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May, in which seven others also died. The leaders of China, India and Russia have all congratulated Dr Pezeshkian on his victory. Even before the final results were declared by Iran's interior ministry, Dr Pezeshkian's supporters had taken to the streets in Tehran and a number of other cities to celebrate. Videos posted on social media showed mostly young people dancing and waving the signature green flag of his campaign, while passing cars sounded their horns.  Dr Pezeshkian, a 71-year-old heart surgeon and member of the Iranian parliament, is critical of Iran’s notorious morality police and caused a stir after promising “unity and cohesion”, as well as an end to Iran's “isolation” from the world.  He has also called for “constructive negotiations” with Western powers over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of Western sanctions. His rival, Saeed Jalili, favours the status quo. The former nuclear negotiator enjoys strong support amongst Iran’s most religious communities. Mr Jalili is known for his hardline anti-Western stance and opposition to restoring the nuclear deal, which he says crossed Iran’s “red lines"". Turnout in the latest round of voting was 50% - higher than the first round last week, when the turnout was the lowest since the Islamic revolution in 1979 amid widespread discontent, but still considerably low. Widespread discontent meant that millions of people boycotted the elections.  Lack of choice in the candidates, dominated by Islamic hard liners, and the impossibility of real change as long as the supreme leader tightly controls policies added to their frustration. Some people who did not vote in the first round were persuaded to cast their ballot for Dr Pezeshkian this time round to prevent Mr Jalili from becoming the president.  They feared that if he won, Iran would be heading for more confrontation with the outside world and that he would bring Iran more sanctions and further isolation. In order to stand, both candidates had to make it through a vetting process run by the Guardian Council, a body made up of 12 clerics and jurists that hold significant power in Iran.  That process saw 74 other candidates removed from the race, including several women. The Guardian Council has previously been criticised by human rights groups for disqualifying candidates who are not loyal enough to the regime. After years of civil unrest - culminating in anti-regime protests that shook the country in 2022-23 - many young and middle-class Iranians deeply mistrust the establishment and have previously refused to vote. On Iranian social media, the Persian hashtag ""traitorous minority"" went viral, urging people not to vote for either of the candidates and calling anyone who did a ""traitor"". But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected suggestions that the low turnout represents a rejection of his rule. ""There are reasons [behind the low turnout] and politicians and sociologists will examine them, but if anyone thinks that those who did not vote are against the establishment, they are plainly wrong,"" he said. In a rare move, he acknowledged that some Iranians do not accept the current regime. ""We listen to them and we know what they are saying and it is not like they are hidden and not seen,"" Mr Khamenei said.",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx824yl3ln4o,"Kasra Naji,",2024-07-06 12:08:56,
123,Sacred buffalo calf offers hope amid efforts to revive species,"With cream-coloured fur and jet-black eyes, one of the smallest specimens of America’s largest native animal stumbled into the spotlight on shaky legs. Advocates hope the June birth of a white buffalo calf  - an exceedingly rare event - will translate into new momentum for a decades-long push to revive the species in America's Great Plains. Many tribes consider a white bison birth to be a sacred omen that signifies change. The herd this calf was born into has also become an important cultural symbol - it's the last wild buffalo herd in North America.  The herd is entering a new chapter of its life as stewardship of the species is increasingly being overseen by indigenous communities again and advocates push to grow bison populations. The American buffalo, also known as bison, once numbered in the tens of millions before being brought to the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Now, the only wild herd in the US is limited to just 5,000 animals.  But tribes and bison advocates see opportunity as Yellowstone, America’s first national park and the home of the white calf, considers a proposal to expand the wild herd’s size for the first time in decades.  The white calf has added spiritual significance to buffalo advocates' efforts as they test a long-standing status quo where government policies prioritise beef ranching over the beliefs of native tribes.  Just after noon on 4 June, Yellowstone photography guide Jordan Creech was sightseeing with clients when he spotted the freshly-born white buffalo calf, taking its first steps in the park’s Lamar Valley. Bison calves can walk within two minutes of being born, and run alongside their herd within the first seven minutes of life. “It’s the most unique experience I’ve ever had,” Creech says. Erin Braaten, a photographer of Native American descent from Kalispell, Montana, also witnessed the calf’s first moments of life before it disappeared into the herd. ""I thought I'd have a better chance of capturing Bigfoot than a white bison calf,"" she tells BBC News. For the last 2,000 years the people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakoda tribes have told the story of a woman who arrived during a time of need. A version speaks of two scouts searching for food and buffalo in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The mysterious woman appeared and offered their tribe a bundle of sacred gifts, including a pipe carved from red rock, and instructed the people on how to live and pray. She transformed several times before taking the form a white buffalo calf with a black nose, black eyes and black hooves. As she departed, a great number of buffalo returned to feed the people. Dozens of other tribes have white buffalo stories, interpreting its arrival as both a blessing and a warning. Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Tribe, is known as the Keeper of the Sacred Bundle — the bundle and pipe left by the spirit. He likens the white calf’s return to the second coming of Christ. Looking Horse, 70, said that before she departed, the woman told the people that she would return as a white buffalo calf “when everything is sickly and not good, and when people are with a not good mind”. “This is spirit. It means spirit is happening,” he added. On 26 June, more than 500 supporters formally celebrated the white calf at an event in West Yellowstone, just outside the park. Nearly a dozen tribes were represented.  Together, they heard the name bestowed upon the calf - Wakan Gli, meaning Sacred Returns or Comes Holy in the Lakota language. An altar of three buffalo skulls and three buffalo robes marked the occasion. Waemaetekosew Waupekenay, 38, who travelled from Wisconsin to attend on behalf of the Menominee Tribe, said the birth of the sacred calf has been a spiritual awakening. Its arrival, he says with amazement, shows that “there's a lot of healing, a lot of love going around. People are being united.” National Park rangers at Yellowstone have confirmed the white bison's birth, but rangers have not reported any sightings themselves. “The birth of a white bison calf in the wild is a landmark event in the ecocultural recovery of bison by the National Park Service,” the park said in a statement on 28 June confirming it as the first white bison ever seen inside Yellowstone. They added that it ""may reflect the presence of a natural genetic legacy that was preserved in Yellowstone’s bison, which has revealed itself because of the successful recovery of a wild bison population"". ""The National Park Services acknowledges the significance of a white bison calf for American Indians,” it added. The Yellowstone bison make up the only wild herd in the US and are among the last genetically pure bison in existence. But Yellowstone National Park regularly reaches the legally-permitted capacity of 5,000.  Tribes who support the species' growth have stepped in, believing the species' health is tied to their own history. Since 2019, the US National Park Service has transferred 414 healthy bison from Yellowstone to 26 tribes in 12 states through the Bison Conservation Transfer Program. Native people also have their own distribution system to share buffalo independent of the park's efforts. Since 1992, the Intertribal Buffalo Council -  a collective of 83 tribes working to “restore the cultural, spiritual and historic relationships” with the animals - has sent 25,000 bison to 65 herds on tribal lands in 22 states. “People don’t understand or realise that what happened to the buffalo similarly happened to native people, and that history is intertwined,” says Jason Baldes, who serves as vice-president of the council and is a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The returning of buffalo to tribal people marks a major change in federal policy for a country whose soldiers had once been ordered to kill them all to deprive tribes of food and supplies. And officials are not only returning animals, they're considering taking on more themselves: the National Park Service has just completed an environmental impact study at Yellowstone, and determined that the size of the herd should increase from 5,000 to 6,000 - but could accommodate as many as 10,000. It's the first time the park has proposed an increase in 24 years. The herd’s growth is made more striking by the fact that up to 60 million American buffalo were killed in the rush to claim ownership of the American frontier.  Unlike the native people - who are known to use nearly every part of the animal for food, shelter and more – the settlers killed them with reckless abandon, taking furs and leaving carcasses to rot. By the 20th Century, no more than 1,000 bison remained in the wild. Large-scale cattle operations took over the empty land and commercial interests continue to be a source of conflict between those who wish to see the wild buffalo roam as they once did, and the livestock industry. Ranchers and the state's Republican governor oppose the park service’s proposal to expand the herd, fearing a disease called brucellosis - which is carried by about 60% of Yellowstone bison - could infect beef herds and undercut profit margins.  The Montana Stockgrowers Association, which opposes the plan, has warned that the new policy could lead “to an exponential growth in bison numbers”. Elk are also known to transfer brucellosis to domestic livestock, but do not face the same restrictions as bison. Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a Montana-based non-profit which works to increase wild bison numbers, says the debate “is part of the old range wars of the West, competition for grass and which animals get to eat it”. Yellowstone officials previously conceded that the controversy over bison management is a complex challenge with several opposing interest groups. “It’s probably the single-most challenging wildlife issue in Yellowstone,” Cam Sholly, the park superintendent, told the New York Times last year. “The bison is the only species we constrain to a boundary.” But for tribes, the birth of the white calf is proof that more needs to done to support bison. The fact that the calf comes from Yellowstone has imparted it with extra spiritual significance. “The Yellowstone [herd] are the most purest, wildest buffalo – the only left in the country,” Chief Looking Horse says. “This is a message that Mother Earth is speaking through the animal nation.”",2024-07-06 23:08:56,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5xjzqree2o,"Max Matza,",2024-07-06 03:08:56,
142,"We have too many prisoners, says new PM Starmer","Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to reduce the number of people going to prison through renewed efforts to cut reoffending. In his first press conference as prime minister, Sir Keir said too many people found themselves back in jail ""relatively quickly"" after being sent there. He added that intervening to prevent young people committing knife crime would be an early priority for his new government. But he said there would be no ""overnight solution"" to prison overcrowding, adding: ""We’ve got too many prisoners, not enough prisons."" It comes after he appointed a businessman as his prisons minister who has previously said only a third of prisoners should be there. James Timpson, boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of recruiting ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that ""we're addicted to punishment”. Labour, which won a landslide general election victory on Thursday, has promised to review sentencing after regaining office for the first time since 2010. It has also inherited a ballooning crisis in Britain's jails, and has already committed to keeping the previous Conservative government's early release scheme in place to ease current levels of overcrowding.  Last week the Prison Governors’ Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days. Tory ex-justice secretary Alex Chalk first announced plans to release prisoners early in October 2023. Mr Chalk, who lost his seat to the Lib Dems in the general election, told MPs at the time the ""prison population is greater than it has ever been"" and the UK ""must use prison better"". However, he added: ""We must do whatever it takes to always ensure there are always enough prison places to lock up the most dangerous offenders to keep the British public safe."" Details of Labour's review are yet to be unveiled, but Mr Timpson's appointment has offered an early signal that a change of approach may be on the cards in this area. Sir Keir has appointed him a member of the House of Lords, allowing him to take up a post as prisons minister at the Ministry of Justice. The businessman told a Channel 4 podcast in February that prison was a ""disaster"" for around a third of prisoners, and another third ""probably shouldn’t be there"". He said too many people being in prison for ""far too long"" was an example of ""evidence being ignored because there is this sentiment around punish and punish”. ""We’re addicted to sentencing, we’re addicted to punishment,"" he added. Asked about his comments at a Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir did not offer a view on whether he agreed with those estimates. But he added: ""We do need to be clear about the way in which we use prisons. “For so many people [who] come out of prison, they’re back in prison relatively quickly afterwards. “That is a massive problem that we have in this country, that we do need to break."" He said his party wanted to cut knife crime in particular, and cited his plan to set up a network of ""youth hubs"". Sir Keir, a former lawyer, added: “I’ve sat in the back of I don’t know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. “I’ve often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they’d had support”. Labour says it wants to create 20,000 prison places by enabling ministers to override local councils on planning decisions.  But it also plans to keep in place the scheme implemented by the last government under which some lower-level offenders can be released up to 70 days early. Sir Keir said Conservative ministers had created a ""mess"" by failing to build enough prisons and mismanaging the prisons budget. Defending his decision to keep the early-release scheme in place, he added: ""We don’t have the prisons we need, and I can’t build a prison within 24 hours."" The latest official figures, published on Friday, put the prison population of England and Wales at 87,453 out of a ""useable operational capacity"" of 88,864. The SNP-run Scottish government, responsible for prisons in Scotland, plans to release between 500 and 550 inmates in the coming months. It comes as Sir Keir convened the first Labour cabinet meeting in 14 years,  telling his top team he expects them to hold themselves and their departments to the ""highest standards of integrity and honesty"". A Downing Street readout from the meeting said the prime minister told ministers ""the whole country was looking to the government to deliver on their priorities"". Following the cabinet, Sir Keir was grilled by journalists at his first press conference as PM. Asked about tax hikes, Sir Keir said he would take ""tough decisions"" and face challenges with ""raw honesty"". The new Labour government faces tough choices on public finances, with forecasts suggesting major spending cuts. But Thursday's landslide victory in the General Election has given Labour ""a clear mandate to govern for all four corners of the United Kingdom,"" Sir Keir said as he set out plans to tour all four UK nations in the coming days. Saturday also saw the final result of the general election, with the Lib Dems winning the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. The outcome had originally been expected at about 05:00 BST on Friday, but a recount meant the results were delayed until Saturday afternoon. Candidate Angus MacDonald gained a majority of 2,160 over the SNP's Drew Hendry. It means the Lib Dems have won 72 Westminster seats. Six of these are in Scotland, meaning the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish Conservatives as Scotland's third largest party in Westminster.  Across the UK, Labour won 412 seats while the Conservatives were on 121.  ",2024-07-06 23:08:57,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c16jpkzz9g3o,"Paul Seddon,",2024-07-06 19:08:57,
137,Mexico's coast battered by Hurricane Beryl,"Hurricane Beryl has lashed Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula after wreaking havoc across the Caribbean, causing at least 10 deaths.  It made landfall as a category-two hurricane early on Friday, bringing winds of up to 175km/h (108mph).  It was later downgraded to a tropical storm, but is expected to re-intensify over the Gulf the Mexico at the weekend. Beryl brought heavy rain to tourist hotspots of Cancún and Tulum. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages. Civil protection chief Laura Velazquez said power would be fully restored to those still without it by Sunday.  Tulum resident Carolina Vazquez was among those to be affected by the outages, speaking to the Reuters news agency as she queued at a soup kitchen organised by the Mexican army on Friday.  ""In my little house a tree fell down, half of the house cracked, the roof tiles,"" she said. Fernando Trevino, an employee at a local business, said: ""We are evaluating, but so far it seems that everything is in order with the protections that were put in place, the preparations and so."" Ahead of Beryl's arrival, Schools were closed, hotel windows boarded up, and emergency shelters were set up in areas facing the brunt of the impact.  More than 8,000 troops from the army, air force and national guard were deployed in the Yucatán Peninsula to provide support.  Hundreds of tourists were evacuated from hotels, and more than 3,000 fled from Holbox Island off the coast, according to local authorities. More than 300 flights were cancelled or delayed. On Thursday, many homes and businesses were badly damaged in the Cayman Islands, particularly along the coastline, where entire neighbourhoods were inundated. Hurricane Beryl battered Jamaica on Wednesday after causing huge devastation across other Caribbean nations.  Hurricanes frequently occur near the peninsula, with the official storm season running from June to late November.  The storm is projected to travel over the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas by the end of the weekend. By the time it makes landfall again on Sunday evening, the storm is expected to have strengthened back to a hurricane. Texas Governor Greg Abbott told people near the state's Gulf coast to ""have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones"".

155,'One of the world's best' - Saka's 'special' moment of redemption,"This video can not be played Watch all the penalties from England's dramatic quarter-final against Switzerland Bukayo Saka is Stuart Pearce for the TikTok generation. Young fans watching England reach a European Championship semi-final via a perfect penalty shootout might not know who Pearce is, but there were more than a few echoes of Euro 96 in Dusseldorf on Saturday night. England have only scored all their penalties in a major tournament shootout twice – against Spain at Wembley in 1996, and versus Switzerland in 2024. Against Spain, Pearce slammed home the third spot-kick and celebrated in trademark style with a fist pump and roar, the sinews in his neck straining to breaking point. Against Switzerland, Saka slotted home the third spot-kick and celebrated in trademark style with a wide and beaming smile, the image of the star boy so loved by the new generation of England supporters. For both men, shootout success brought redemption. Pearce scored his penalty six years after missing in the 1990 World Cup semi-final defeat by West Germany. Saka scored his penalty three years after missing in a European Championship final defeat by Italy. When Trent Alexander-Arnold scored the winning kick, Saka did not rush to celebrate with the bulk of team-mates, but sank to his knees with arms aloft in thanks. This was redemption, Saka-style - done with class, abundant skill and with irresistible likeability. ""I think for me, it's something I embrace,"" Saka said of exorcising the demons of Euro 2020. ""You can fail once but you have a choice whether you put yourself in that position again and I'm a guy who is going to put myself in that position. ""I believed in myself and when the ball hit the net I was a very happy man."" ‘Arrogance and confidence’ – breaking down England’s perfect penalties Watch Euro 2024 on BBC iPlayer Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast This video can not be played Watch: Saka equalises for England The demons of Euro 2020 had been racist, disgusting and vile. Saka, along with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, was subjected to the most horrendous abuse after missing in the shootout against the Italians. Saka, just 19 at the time, took the fifth kick for England and saw Gianluigi Donnarumma save his effort. He was left in tears on the pitch. Three years later, and the circumstances could not be more contrasting.  Saka - no longer a teenage squad player, but key to England’s hopes - had dragged his team back into the game with a brilliant strike from 18 yards, just five minutes after Breel Embolo put Switzerland ahead. And, at the end, after the penalty shootout, he was smiling and celebrating with his team-mates on the pitch amid joyous scenes. ""In that shootout, the smile on Saka's face was brilliant,"" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told BBC Radio 5 Live. “You can't help but be reminded of the [Euro] 2020 final and it was great to see him put it away.” Southgate, who held the sobbing Saka tight on the sodden Wembley pitch in 2021, went through his own shootout pain as a player. His was the one kick saved in the Euro 1996 semi-final as Germany edged past England. ""It was so brave from Bukayo - he is one of our best and we were never in question he would take one,"" Southgate said. ""But we all knew what he went through. “I love them all but I had to give him an extra-big hug. I know myself these experience shape you. He has come back stronger, still resilient and loved. Tonight his tournament ignited a little bit."" It was not just the cool head in the shootout, of course. Saka was the most vibrant attacking outlet for England throughout the match, the high point being his brilliantly taken goal just as it looked like the Three Lions were down and out. Swiss defender Michel Aebischer will never want to face Saka again. The England winger successfully dribbled past him four times in the first half, more than one player had beaten another in any Euro 2024 match until that point. Euro 2024: England into semi-final after penalty shootout win against Switzerland - report and reaction 'If I can't enjoy this then it's a waste of time' Fans and pundits react to England win Bukayo Saka's penalty carried shades of the redemption Stuart Pearce found for England at Euro 96 ""He is arguably the most important England player because he does something different. He beats players,"" former England defender Rio Ferdinand told BBC One. ""He is like Arjen Robben. You know he is coming inside but you can't stop him because he is so sharp. He is the one of best wingers in the world. ""Saka has come to England’s rescue again,"" added ex-England captain Alan Shearer. ""Big players step up in big moments."" Saka's stellar showing becomes even more impressive in the context of where he played. Southgate changed formation to a 3-4-2-1, with the Arsenal winger redeployed into a very unfamiliar role at right wing-back. Saka, who was unhappy to be played as an emergency left-back against Slovakia in the last 16, took to this role with gusto. He provided England with threat and sparkle out wide, beating his markers inside and out - a quality the Three Lions have lacked throughout a Euros campaign that could charitably be described as stodgy at times. ""Unbelievable to play a new position compared to what he's used to,"" England captain Harry Kane told BBC One when asked about Saka. ""He has been eager to help the team and to play the way he did for 120-minutes - at the end he was knackered."" Tired but beaming, Saka said this was ""up there"" with the best experiences of his England career. ""Last time we took a penalty shootout at the Euros, we know what happened,"" he told BBC One. ""I believed. I felt like we dominated the whole game and the chance would come and I took it - I am proud of myself for that."" Like Pearce, Saka has found England redemption in a Euros penalty shootout. But for the fans young and old who idolise him, who know what he had to go through three years ago, there is something extra sweet in the story of this remarkable young man.",2024-07-06 23:08:58,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c25ljqrq2w1o,Emma Smith,2024-07-06 22:08:58,
153,Djokovic bounces back to reach fourth round,"This video can not be played Djokovic beats Popyrin in four sets - Best shots Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic came from a set down to book his place in the Wimbledon fourth round with victory over Australia's Alexei Popyrin. After a slow start on Centre Court, Djokovic, who has 24 Grand Slam titles, won 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-3). He will play Holger Rune next after the Danish 15th seed mounted a comeback of his own, prevailing over Frenchman Quentin Halys in five sets having trailed by two. ""A very challenging match, I think mentally as well, to hang in there,"" said Djokovic.  ""I was not allowed to have too big concentration lapses. I think I've done well in that regard. That was one of the best tie-breaks I've played this year, that's for sure."" Popyrin, who had never been beyond the second round in four previous visits to Wimbledon, came out with intent and took the first set with a break of serve in game seven. But a lengthy break before the start of the second set as the roof was closed played into Djokovic's hands, as the Serb started to find his rhythm. The 37-year-old, still sporting a knee support on his right leg following surgery in June, broke Popyrin in the fourth game. There was a brief interruption to play late in the set when fans on Centre Court burst into celebration as England beat Switzerland on penalties to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2024. Fortunately, both players saw the funny side as Djokovic mimicked kicking a football and Popyrin raised his arms to imitate making a save. Djokovic went on to wrap up the set with his 1,000th ace in the men's singles at Wimbledon - just the sixth male player to achieve that feat. Momentum remained with Djokovic in the third, breaking Popyrin in the first game, and he dropped just three points on serve before another ace sealed the set. The fourth set proved a much tighter affair, with Djokovic missing three break points before a tie-break was required to settle the match. ""I didn't expect anything less than what we experienced on the court today from Alexei,"" Djokovic added. ""With that serve and powerful forehand, he's dangerous on any surface. ""I knew he was in form and he was going to come out believing he can win. He was the better player in the first set. I think I played a good second and third and the fourth was anybody's game. This video can not be played 'Couldn't do that again if he tried' - Ben Shelton hits incredible point Meanwhile Ben Shelton says he is ""100% ready to go the distance"" again after coming through a third successive five-set match to reach the Wimbledon fourth round. The American 14th seed defeated 2021 semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-4 4-6 6-2 on Court One. Up next for Shelton is world number one Jannik Sinner on Sunday. It will be a huge task for the 21-year-old, who has played on five of the six days in the Championships so far. However, Shelton said he is ""really excited"" about facing the Italian and ""always confident in my abilities, no matter who is on the other side of the net"". He has followed in the footsteps of his father and coach Bryan, who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon 30 years ago. Resuming from Friday with Shelton leading 3-2 in the first set, both players held firm on their serve to set up a tie-break which the Canadian took. Mistakes from Shelton put him on the back foot but he used an excitable crowd to take the next two sets with some fantastic serving. However, Shapovalov fought back to force Shelton into another deciding set. Buoyed by the American support in the crowd, Shelton produced a host of brilliant forehand winners to book his place in the last 16 in three hours and five minutes. Eight-time men's champion Roger Federer was in attendance on Court One alongside parents Robert and Lynette Elsewhere, fifth seed Daniil Medvedev set up a meeting with 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov after beating German Jan-Lennard Struff 6-1 6-3 4-6 7-6 (7-3). Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard became the fifth lucky loser in the Open era to reach the fourth round with a 4-6 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 win over 87th-ranked Emil Ruusuvuori. Perricard's reward is a meeting with Italian 25th seed Lorenzo Musetti, who beat Argentina's Francisco Comesana 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, who defeated Britain's Cameron Norrie, will face Taylor Fritz in the fourth round after the American 13th seed won 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 7-5 against Chile's Alejandro Tabilo. Fellow Frenchman Ugo Humbert defeated American Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (11-9) 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (8-6) and will play defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

151,'Qualifiers are dangerous' - Raducanu bids for Wimbledon quarters,"Emma Raducanu has reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time since winning the 2021 US Open Emma Raducanu knows full well what it is like to be a little-known qualifier upsetting the odds at a Grand Slam tournament. On Sunday, the boot will be on the other foot at Wimbledon. The 21-year-old Briton famously won the US Open as a teenager qualifier three years ago, creating one of the most stunning shocks in sporting history. Now Raducanu faces New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun, a 23-year-old who had never played in the Wimbledon main draw until this year. The pair meet in the fourth round at around 17:00 BST on Centre Court. ""Qualifiers are dangerous,"" said Raducanu, who has not dropped a set in her opening three victories. ""She’s had three extra matches here at Wimbledon and she is not to be underestimated."" Sun, ranked 123rd in the world, created one of the shocks of the tournament by beating Chinese eighth seed Zheng Qinwen in her first-round match. She is the first woman representing New Zealand to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon in the Open era. ""The preparation doesn’t change I don’t think, you just take it opponent by opponent,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world after injury issues last year. ""I'm expecting her to be really dangerous and come out swinging so it's going to be a really tough match."" Raducanu missed last year's Wimbledon after having surgery on both of her wrists and has needed to be patient on her return to the WTA Tour this year. Difficult decisions have also needed to be made. On Saturday, she made the ""very difficult"" move to pull out of her mixed doubles partnership with Andy Murray - whose Wimbledon career is now over - because of stiffness in her wrist. Raducanu has been cautious in her scheduling this year and opted to miss the clay-court French Open in order to ensure she was in peak condition for the British grass-court season. The move has been fully justified. After encouraging runs in Nottingham and Eastbourne, Raducanu has played some of her best tennis this week since winning the US Open. ""Honestly, I'm just obsessed with tennis right now,"" said Raducanu. ""It's all I want to do and all I want to think about."" Raducanu needed to come through a first-set tie-break against Mexican lucky loser Renata Zarazua in round one, but has dropped just 11 games since after commanding wins over Belgium's Elise Mertens and Greek ninth seed Maria Sakkari. The excitement among the British fans at the All England Club has been further fuelled by Raducanu's section of the draw opening up. If the former British number one beats Sun, another unseeded opponent - Spanish former world number two Paula Badosa or Croatia's Donna Vekic - waits in the quarter-finals. ""I just love playing on the big stages so much,"" said Raducanu. ""It's my favourite thing in the world, it’s the reason I play tennis, to play on these big courts and these big matches. ""It’s really special, you don’t get these opportunities often in life.  ""When I look back later in my career, when I get much older and have retired, I want to be able to tell myself I savoured every moment. ""So I play each point as if it’s my last."" Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz opens the day's play on Centre Court when he faces French 16th seed Ugo Humbert in the fourth round. After Raducanu's match, there is an all-American clash between second seed Coco Gauff and 19th seed Emma Navarro. On Court One, Italian seventh seed Jasmine Paolini - who reached the French Open final last month - takes on American 12th seed Madison Keys. One of that women's quartet is a potential semi-final opponent for Raducanu should she get that far. Italian men's world number one Jannik Sinner, who is aiming for his first Wimbledon title, plays big-serving Ben Shelton of the United States. That match is followed on the second show court by Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev taking on Bulgarian 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov.

149,'If I can't enjoy this then it's a waste of time',"This video can not be played Highlights: England 1-1 Switzerland England manager Gareth Southgate said ""if I can't enjoy this moment then it's a waste of time"" after his side reached the Euro 2024 semi-finals by beating Switzerland 5-3 on penalties. The Three Lions' moment of jubilation was made even sweeter for Southgate as he celebrated with supporters following the recent ""difficult personal"" criticism he has faced in Germany. ""Every now and then surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job,"" said the England manager. ""I love the players and sharing that moment with them. ""I can't deny that when it's [the criticism] as personal as it has been in the last few weeks on a human level, that's quite difficult."" England fell behind after 75 minutes, but Bukayo Saka levelled five minutes later to force extra time before victory in the penalty shootout. Southgate told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I took this job to try and improve English football, to give us nights like this.  ""We continue to give people fantastic memories. We will keep enjoying this journey."" England have now reached their third major tournament semi-final under Southgate's management. ""Now we want to deliver one more thing - we have never been to a final outside England, never won a Euros, so there are two bits of history we would love to create,"" he said. Southgate also expressed frustration as his switch to a three-man defence being revealed three days before the game, describing it as ""quite incredible"". ‘Arrogance and confidence’ – breaking down England’s perfect penalties Fans and pundits react to England win Saka is your man of the match against Switzerland Southgate praised the ""resilience"" his team has shown at Euro 2024 to find a way to get results and keep progressing through the knockouts. ""There is what we ideally want to be and there is how we have found ways with all the obstacles, different challenges, all the way through,"" he said. Southgate added that the current group have continued to win in a way previous England teams haven't. ""With England it was often start 25 minutes really well, go ahead in games and then out in the early knockout rounds. We weren't savvy or tournament wise. This group are different. They keep possession for longer periods."" The England boss added that his team have the ""attributes"" of a winning side. He said: ""We haven't always got it right but in general we have shown the resilience that teams that win tournaments have had for years - Italy, France, Spain… it is not all pure football, it is other attributes they have had."" This video can not be played Pundits analyse Southgate Former England defender Rio Ferdinand, speaking on BBC One: ""I am looking at the team and in tournament football we are doing the right thing - we are moving in an upwards direction. ""Today wasn't perfect but it was such an improvement. Then it was nerves of steel when it mattered. I had no doubt in my mind."" Former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""England are getting incrementally better. There are so many questions this team have been asked. ""But imagine playing beautiful football and being beaten on penalties. It goes to nothing. There is character, resilience, a will to win and energy. These things can carry you a long way. ""You have got to be talking about them now to be in the final, perhaps, from what we have seen."" Former England defender Micah Richards, speaking on BBC One: ""We want to talk positively about England. ""We are on the front foot and everyone seems together - that is important."" Former England striker Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC One: ""The emotions the England team will be going through - they'll be ecstatic and so they should. They've put an incredible shift in. ""A big shout-out to the manager - his preparation was absolutely key. The players he brought on to take penalties, they were just perfect.
